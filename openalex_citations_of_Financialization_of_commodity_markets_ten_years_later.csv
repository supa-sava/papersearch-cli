Topological Properties of International Commodity Market: How Uncertainty Affects the Linkages?,"ABSTRACT The study aims to explore the network topology of the international commodity market by examining the interconnections among 21 commodity futures across various categories, including energy, precious and industrial metals, and agriculture. We analyze the market structure of these commodity futures under both low and high uncertainty conditions to assess whether uncertainty impacts the commodity market structure. To do this, we employ the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) and Hierarchical Tree (HT) methods. Our empirical findings, based on data from January 2014 to March 2023, reveal that energy commodities are not positioned at the center of the market; rather, agricultural commodities take this central role. In terms of uncertainty, the commodity market topology during periods of high uncertainty is more integrated than during times of low uncertainty, indicating that higher uncertainty leads to a more synchronized movement of commodities. These insights provide valuable guidance for traders, investors, and policymakers.",2025-03-22,
The Determinants of Marginal Convenience Yield in Agricultural Commodity Markets,"Abstract We report a significant downward trend in the convenience yield for holding physical inventory in agricultural commodity futures markets, attributing this negative trend to speculative demand shocks, which in turn, leads in decreasing agricultural convenience yields. Moreover, agricultural convenience yields appear negative on average during the recent financialization (of commodities) period. We additionally show that the response of agricultural convenience yields to commodity price uncertainty and supply shocks is much less pronounced in magnitude and persistence compared to that of hedging demand shocks. Overall, our analysis verifies the Keynesian theory of normal backwardation by showing a long‐lasting positive response of agricultural convenience yields to a hedging demand shock, thereby leaving the hedging demand as the most significant factor explaining the less frequently observed backwardations in agricultural futures markets.",2025-01-14,
Is corn still king? Unravelling time-varying interactions among soft commodities,"Abstract This paper explores correlation dynamics among agricultural commodities, crucial for risk mitigation and portfolio management, particularly within volatile soft commodities. Previous studies have found a significant increase in correlations among soft commodities, with corn found to exhibit the largest correlation with other commodities Recently, soft commodities have experienced both increasing price volatility and increasing liquidity. This paper examines twelve commodities from January 2013 to September 2023 using a dynamic connectedness framework. The results confirm agricultural commodity market integration as a high level of interconnectedness is found. Soybeans, canola and corn are found, on average, to be the net transmitters of volatility in the network, with corn being the only commodity to remain a net transmitter with positive net directional connectedness values for the full sample period. The influencing role of corn on soft commodity price volatility is therefore confirmed. Coffee and wheat are also found to be net transmitters of volatility. Significantly, the paper underscores the growing influence of edible oils like canola, palm oil and soybean oil in network analyses, a contribution yet to be documented. Given the diverse industrial and cross-sector applications of these commodities as raw materials, these findings have important implications for various stakeholders across agribusinesses, as well as for both hedgers and speculators active in commodity futures markets.",2025-01-11,
"Macroeconomic Conditions, Speculation, and Commodity Futures Returns","This paper examines the dynamic relationships between speculative activities, commodity returns, and macroeconomic conditions across five sectors compassing 29 commodities. Using weekly data spanning from January 2000 to July 2023, we construct comprehensive measures of commodity market speculation across five sectors and examine their sector-specific impact on returns through advanced econometric methods, including dynamic conditional correlation models, quantile regressions, Markov-switching models, and time-varying Granger causality tests. Our results reveal that the impact of speculative activities on commodity futures returns is conditional on the commodity sector and prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, the relationship between macroeconomic factors, speculative activities, and commodity futures returns is time varying. Among the macroeconomic variables, the financial stress indicator, as measured by the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index, shows a significant ability to predict commodity futures returns. The relationship between speculation and commodity returns is bi-directional across all sectors.",2025-01-08,
Term Structure and Risk Premiums of Commodity Futures With Linear Regressions,"ABSTRACT We apply the regression‐based affine term structure model to estimate the term structure of commodity futures. This model is advantageous in that it has a simple and fast algorithm, can accommodate a variety of observable and unspanned factors, and can be applied to daily and even real‐time observations. The results show that the model appropriately captures time‐series variations across different maturities and exhibits satisfactory performance in capturing cross‐sectional variations for specific months. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the existing commodity risk factor returns and the risk premiums inferred by the model. Our analysis reveals that different risk factor returns explain the spot and term premiums differently. Therefore, using the advantages of the model, we can better understand the term structure and risk premiums in commodity futures.",2024-12-24,
Uma investigação sobre a influência da negociação de contratos futuros na volatilidade do preço à vista do açúcar,"O Brasil desempenha um papel crucial no mercado global de açúcar, sendo o principal produtor e exportador. Este estudo investiga o impacto do volume de negociação dos contratos futuros de açúcar na volatilidade dos preços à vista, abordando a relação entre os mercados futuros e à vista de commodities através da análise do volume de contratos negociados e em aberto do Sugar No 11 e o indicador do açúcar cristal branco à vista estipulado pelo CEPEA/ESALQ/USP. Utilizando testes de Causalidade de Granger e análise da variância do erro de previsão, a pesquisa analisa dados da década de 2012-2022. Os resultados indicam a ausência de evidências estatísticas suficientes para rejeitar a hipótese nula de falta de causalidade Granger. Isso sugere que, nas diferentes defasagens consideradas, não se pode afirmar com confiança a presença de causalidade temporal entre as séries analisadas.",2024-08-14,
Did grain futures prices overreact to the Russia–Ukraine war due to herding?,"We study the impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on grain futures prices. The war allows us to evaluate whether commodity futures markets at the time were driven by investor herding. Using event study methods, we find that wheat futures prices rose by 35 percent above the counterfactual until the EU Solidarity Lanes were announced, more than corn futures prices, which were up 16 percent. This relative price response cannot be explained by herding behavior. Furthermore, prices for control commodities did not respond to the war at all, contradicting the herding theory. There is no statistical evidence of abnormal speculative pressure in the market around the time of the invasion, and we conclude the markets put a fair price on the wartime risk of Black Sea grain shipment disruptions.",2024-08-07,
How Much Bitcoin Should We Allocate to the Portfolio?,"A comparative analysis between 2013-2017 and 2018-2023 reveals a significant transformation in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments.In the earlier phase, methods like the Markowitz Model suggested significant allocation to Bitcoin due to its high returns, diversification benefits, and low correlation with other assets.However, with the financialization of Bitcoin in December 2017, the cryptocurrency market underwent a fundamental shift, integrating into the mainstream financial system and increasing its correlation with traditional assets.In the subsequent period from 2018 to 2023, Bitcoin emerged as an average asset class with relatively high risk compared to others.Given these changes and increased institutional interest, our analysis suggests it's prudent to cap allocation to Bitcoin to maximally 2-3% of the portfolio.The analysis highlights the need for caution and realistic expectations when interpreting historical data and extrapolating long-term conclusions.",2024-06-05,
"COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices and Saudi stock market: empirical evidence from ARDL modeling and Bayer–Hanck cointegration approach","Abstract In 2020, the world experienced several significant events, including the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the collapse of international crude oil prices. The rapid spread of this pandemic has dramatic impacts on financial markets all over the world, thereby increasing market risk aversion in an unprecedented way since the subprime financial crisis. The decline in stock markets implied volatilities of equity and oil prices, thereby heightening turmoil in global financial markets despite comprehensive and substantial financial reforms. To this end, we investigated the likely effects of this pandemic on the Saudi stock market while controlling for oil prices based on daily data for a period from 1/1/2020 to 19/9/2022. To ascertain the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables, we applied autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modeling and the error correction model, with this ultimately revealing the existence of strong cointegration in the long run. The ARDL bounds test was found to be robust by combined cointegration tests, thus providing further evidence of a strong relationship in the long run. Granger causality tests also yielded evidence of causality between the variables in both directions. The total COVID-19 confirmed cases and oil prices also caused movements in stock returns in the short run. Our findings have some prominent implications for asset managers and policymakers to improve stock market efficiency and boost global economic activity. Saudi authorities can consequently remove the regulatory and legal obstacles to develop their stock market and better improve the risk management, which will allow to make quick decisions in response to any oil price volatilities. Policymakers should also adopt proactive strategies that can comfort stock investors’ anxieties over the increasing oil price volatilities. Finally, the findings should be treated with some cautions because of the limited sample size and the tests’ statistical inference. Nevertheless, they do open opportunities for further studies to look in more detail at how the COVID-19 pandemic affected, over the short and long run, monetary and fiscal policy coordination, financial stability, and various other macroeconomic indicators in Saudi Arabia.",2024-06-03,
Hedging basic materials equity portfolios using gold futures,"Commodities can be treated as an alternative investment, a hedging strategy, or a diversification opportunity. Various types of commodities, especially metals, usually are not strongly affected by inflation, and the trends of their prices are not correlated with other investment instruments. To participate in the metals area of the commodity market, an investor can buy shares of companies from the basic materials sector. Such companies are involved in discovering, developing, and processing raw materials. However, as not all the companies from the basic materials sector deal with precious metals, it is worth adding gold futures to such a portfolio. The aim of this paper is to compare a portfolio of the basic materials sector stocks against a similar portfolio hedged with gold. Our findings revealed that hedging a commodities’ portfolio with gold minimizes both profits and losses and can be suitable for risk-averse investors. The research results can be applied by individual investors and investment managers to choose the most appropriate investment approach.",2024-06-01,
Does “Paper Oil” Matter? Energy Markets’ Financialization and Co-Movements with Equity Markets,"We revisit, and document new facts regarding, the financialization of U.S. energy markets in 2000–2010. We show that, after controlling for macroeconomic factors and physical energy market fundamentals, the strength of energy markets’ co-movements with the U.S. stock market is positively related to the energy paper market activity of hedge funds that trade both asset classes. This relation weakens when credit risk is elevated. We find, in contrast, no link with the aggregate positions of commodity index traders in energy futures markets. Our findings have implications for the ongoing debate regarding the financialization of commodities.",2024-05-23,
"Food, energy, and water nexus: A study on interconnectedness and trade-offs","This study finds interesting outcomes regarding the interlinkage between the food, energy, and water sectors. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization data from January 1961 till January 2023 are employed for six variables, namely Total Renewable Water resources per capita (TRW), Total Internal Renewable Water resources per capita (TIRW), Total Water Withdrawal per capita (TWW), Global Food Consumption per capita (GFC), Global Crop Production (GCP), and Global Electricity Consumption (GEC). Employing Quantile Vector Auto-Regression (QVAR) methodology, we observe asymmetry in connectedness across quantiles. Positive shocks produce stronger impacts in the variables than negative ones. Crop production mostly acts as a receiver of shocks. Renewable water is a consistent net emitter in all circumstances, while water withdrawal is crucial during negative shocks regime as well as in neutral time.",2024-04-04,
"Price-making in provisioning systems and social-ecological transformation? The cases of the electric vehicle metals copper, cobalt, and lithium","Research and debates around mineral extraction in the context of social-ecological transformation have to date dedicated limited attention to price-making. Drawing on the provisioning systems approach, this article assesses price-making in mineral provisioning as contested processes. We argue that price-making is not an objective or solely technical process taking place on abstract markets but rather it is, first, reflective of power struggles over specific rules and devices between different actors, embedded in social relations, network practices, and institutions and, second, linked to the materialities of commodities and the territorial and organizational forms of their provisioning. Empirically, we analyze the ""electric vehicle metals"" copper, cobalt, and lithium for which derivative markets are intensifying their role as price-determination institutions linked particularly to the interest of financial actors in getting price exposure. The article criticizes current shifts to benchmark- and derivative markets-based price-determination. This approach focuses on short-term demand and supply considerations without considering local producer-region production specificities, broader economic impacts, and environmental and social costs and risks. Moreover, it fails to address the long-term insecurities related to resource depletion. With financial actors dominating price-determination on derivative markets, prices deviate even from such a narrow fundamental demand and supply perspective, increasing volatility and short-termism. Alternative price-making mechanisms are needed, together with other policies for social-ecological transformation which requires political regulation embedded in democratic decision-making. Methodologically, the article is based on production, trade, and financial data and semi-structured interviews with representatives of price-determination institutions, metal-provisioning systems, and producer countries.",2024-04-02,
Do the impacts of the futures-spot spread and skewness on the interdependence between spot and futures markets differ across regimes and energy commodities markets?,"This paper investigates whether the impacts of the futures-spot spread and skewness on the interdependence between spot and futures markets differ across regimes (backwardation and contango) and energy commodities (crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas) by utilizing a time-varying and asymmetric mixture copula model with an extended generalized autoregressive score (GAS) evolution mechanism to update the mixture parameter. The empirical results demonstrate that the direction and magnitude of the information on the spread hinges on regimes and energy commodities. Both the spread and its skewness can asymmetrically influence the interdependence between crude oil spot and futures market, and their influences are stronger in the contango market than in the backwardation market. Compared to the crude oil market, only the impact of the futures-spot spread is evident for the remaining markets, and the strength of influence is stronger in the backwardation market than in the contango market.",2024-03-22,
Financial regulatory arbitrage and the financialization of commodities,"Abstract We explore the effects of financial regulatory arbitrage on commodity pricing. We examine two types of financial arbitrage: capital‐control arbitrage , in which commodities are imported to circumvent capital controls and profit from disparities in interest rates between domestic and international markets, and dual‐track interest‐rate arbitrage , in which commodities are utilized as collateral to capitalize on domestic dual‐track interest‐rate spreads. Our findings demonstrate that both forms of arbitrage positively affect commodity price returns. However, they affect the inverse relationship between inventory and convenience yield differently. While capital‐control arbitrage can either amplify or weaken this relationship, dual‐track arbitrage makes it less negative.",2024-02-25,
Quantifying spillovers and connectedness among commodities and cryptocurrencies: Evidence from a Quantile-VAR analysis,"This study examines dynamic connectedness linkages between precious metals, manufacturing metals, oil, natural gas, and Bitcoin. The Quantile-VAR methodology is utilised to identify causal spillovers from 2015 through 2022, where results demonstrate significantly stronger pairwise connectedness at extreme quantiles, where the gold-silver and copper-oil pairs exhibit the strongest linkages. Additionally, the overall dynamic connectedness is higher at the lowest and highest quantiles, particularly reinforced during inflationary periods. Copper is identified as the strongest generator of spillovers, followed by silver, nickel, and zinc. There are mixed findings when analysing gold and aluminium, whereas oil, natural gas, and Bitcoin are identified as net receivers. This study provides insight into commodities and cryptocurrency markets' diversifying and hedging abilities during alternative economic and financial conditions.",2024-01-31,
Financial Market Stress and Commodity Returns: A Dynamic Approach,"This paper examines the relationship between commodity index returns and the Office of Financial Research Financial Stress Index (OFR FSI). Utilizing the S&amp;P GSCI and its five sub-indices (agriculture, livestock, energy, industrial metals, and precious metals), we find that the causal relationship between financial market stress and commodity index returns is conditional on the sample period examined and the methodology employed. We also note that stress in financial markets has a negative relationship with commodity index returns during low commodity return states; however, during high commodity return states, financial market stress exhibits a positive relationship with commodity index returns. Our findings highlight the importance of considering a time-varying framework for analyzing commodity return dynamics.",2024-01-24,
The impact of deviations from soybean product crushing estimates on return and risk,"Abstract This study explores how differences in market yields of soymeal and soyoil, as derived from market prices compared to those obtained through the physical process of crushing soybeans, impact the returns and volatilities of these commodities. Positive (negative) deviations are associated with negative (positive) changes in return. Additionally, these deviations positively correlate with return volatility, suggesting that variations from the expected yields lead to price shifts and heightened return volatility. In summary, deviations from the crushing estimates significantly shape the modeling of soybean commodity returns and volatilities, with implications for understanding returns, hedging ratios, and portfolio return variance.",2024-01-18,
Trade Friction and Evolution Process of Price Discovery in China's Agricultural Commodity Markets,"This paper is the first to examine the evolution of price discovery in agricultural commodity markets across the four distinct phases determined by trade friction and trade policy uncertainty. Using cointegrated vector autoregressive model and common factor weights, we report that corn, cotton, soybean meal, and sugar (palm oil, soybean, soybean oil, and wheat) futures (spot) play a dominant role in price discovery during the full sample period. Moreover, the leadership in price discovery evolves over time in conjunction with changes in trade friction phases. However, such results vary across commodities. We also report that most of the agricultural commodity markets are predominantly led by futures markets in price discovery during phase Ⅲ, except for the wheat market. Our results indicate that taking trade friction into consideration would benefit portfolio managements and diversifying agricultural trade partners holds significance.",2024-01-01,

"Financial contagion of commodity markets from energy markets during the pandemic, energy crisis and SMO","The financialization of commodity markets leads to their integration with global financial markets and increasing inclusion in chains of transmission of systemic risk in the economy. Financial contagion is an atypical increase in the interdependence of financial markets under the influence of external shocks. The subject of this study is the financial contagion of global commodity markets (soft and agricultural goods) from the global energy market (oil and gas) during the pandemic, energy crisis and special military operation of Russia in Ukraine (SMO). The purpose of the study is to establish the facts of financial contagion, its dynamics and intensity for different groups of goods. The construction of the author's stress indices allows us to distinguish between periods of a calm market and increased market volatility. Testing for contagion is carried out using the construction of ARDL-GARCH models, dynamic method of co-moments of the returns distribution of the source market of contagion and the recipient market, including the calculation of conditional correlation, coskewness, cokurtosis and covolatility. A conclusion about possible contagion is made based on a comparison of test statistics with a critical value for a normal or asymptotically normal distribution. The study confirmed contagion of exchange-traded futures markets by oil and natural gas futures markets in all periods. Oil market showed greater contagiousness compared to the gas market; oil proved to be relatively uniformly contagious in different periods, while gas proved to be relatively more contagious during the SMO. Agricultural commodities have proven to be more susceptible to contagion from energy markets than soft commodities. Stronger market contagion occurs at higher co-moments of distribution (volatility contagion, return-volatility and return-asymmetry contagion) than at lower co-moments of distribution. The results obtained can be useful for investors in developing optimal hedging strategies and managing investment portfolios, and for the state in improving financial stabilization policies during periods of crisis.",2024-01-01,
Time-Varying Impact of Commodity Prices on Output Growth and Inflation in the Eastern European Countries,"Using quarterly data for the 2002–2022 period, we estimate the output and inflation effects of several commodity prices (agricultural raw materials, crude oil, and metals) for 8 Eastern European countries with different exchange rate regimes. The Kalman filter is used for estimating the time-varying parameters. Our main findings can be summarized in the following way: (i) higher crude oil prices are inflationary in most of the countries (except Slovakia), with a stronger price effect since 2020; (ii) crude oil prices are neutral with respect to output growth in 4 out of 8 countries, with an expansionary effect in Croatia, Slovenia, and Romania, as well as a contractionary effect in Slovakia, but the crude oil shock of 2021–2022 seems to be expansionary in almost all countries (except Slovakia), regardless of the exchange rate regime practiced; (iii) inflation and output effects of metals prices are quite heterogeneous across countries; (iv) agricultural raw material prices play a role in both inflation and output growth only in Bulgaria and Poland. Since 2021, a growing inflationary impact of crude oil prices suggests a stronger monetary policy reaction to the oil shock, especially in the presence of its favorable output effect.",2023-12-20,
The impact of financial speculation on futures contracts price movements: A study of the US markets for dairy commodities,"Research background: The study analyzes whether financial speculation destabilizes commodity prices in light of recent price volatility and spikes in agricultural commodities. The study delves deeper into the US dairy futures markets, which are less studied by other authors in their research and relatively new in comparison to other agricultural commodity markets. These dairy commodity futures contracts provide dairy businesses and farmers the chance to hedge against price risks, which are particularly crucial in uncertain economic times such as the post-2020 COVID-19 pandemic timeframe. The analysis makes use of the weekly returns on futures contracts for nonfat milk powder, butter, milk class III, and cheese that are obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Purpose of the article: Conduct an empirical study to evaluate the effect of financial speculation on dairy product prices on US commodity markets, including the post-2020 timeframe. Methods: Time series analysis is used in the investigation: the generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) method, the Granger causality test, and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Findings &amp; value added: Our analysis's findings show that, even though most commodities experienced an increase in return volatility during the post-2020 period, there is no evidence for financial speculation being the cause of increased returns from dairy futures contracts. The research also suggests that financial speculation, in some cases, even lowers the volatility of dairy futures prices. Therefore, non-commercial market participants may help to distribute price risks, making these markets more liquid.",2023-09-30,
Quantifying Spillovers and Connectedness Among Commodities and Cryptocurrencies: Evidence from a Quantile-Var Analysis,"This study examines dynamic connectedness linkages between pairs and among different commodities, including precious metals, manufacturing metals, oil, natural gas, and Bitcoin, since the emergence of the cryptocurrency market. The Quantile-VAR methodology is utilised to identify causal spillovers over the period 2015 through 2022, where results demonstrate significantly stronger pairwise connectedness at extreme quantiles, where the gold-silver and copper-oil pairs exhibit the strongest linkages. Additionally, the overall dynamic connectedness is higher at the lowest and highest quantiles, which are reinforced during inflationary periods. Copper is identified as the strongest generator of spillovers, followed by silver, nickel, and zinc. Mixed findings are observed for gold and aluminium, whereas oil, natural gas, and Bitcoin are clearly observed to be net receivers. This study provides insight into the previously unknown aspects of diversifying or hedging abilities in the commodities and cryptocurrency markets during alternative economic and financial conditions.",2023-01-01,

Biodiversity Risks in Commodity Markets,"As global biodiversity declines, market participants are increasingly attentive to the financial implications of biodiversity risks. We study the effects of biodiversity risks on commodities futures returns using a novel biodiversity risk index over 2005-2022. Biodiversity risks can’t predict commodities returns, suggesting risk underestimation. Using dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs), we further show that precious metals offer diversification against biodiversity risks, while energy commodities can serve as a hedge or safe haven. However, agricultural commodities don’t provide protection against biodiversity risks, potentially increasing investors exposure to these risks. Our findings are significant for investors and regulators interested in addressing biodiversity risks.",2023-01-01,
Commodity Correlation Risk,"It is widely observed that primary commodity prices comove. A parallel literature asserts that correlation risk matters for financial returns. Our novel study connects these topics and presents evidence that commodity correlation risk is both non-constant and important for returns. We reconsider therefore the relationship between primary commodities, risk and macro fundamentals, utilising methods that account for parameter uncertainty and stochastic volatility. We show that correlation risk is positively related to commodity returns and the strongest impact of risk upon return is more recent. We also demonstrate that commodity correlation risk is strongly counter-cyclical, correlation risk predicts returns, our risk measure is unrelated to other risk/uncertainty measures, and that correlation risk is linked to commodity financialization.",2022-01-01,
Systemic Risk of Commodity Traders,We examine the disruptions to global commodity flows following the bankruptcy of a commodity trading firm. The physical commodity network is operated by a handful of large traders that are responsible for the timely delivery of raw materials and inputs to industrial production. We propose a model that simulates the resilience and response time of the network following a shock. Our results suggest that a number of commodity traders carry significant systemic risk. The forced removal of a trader from the network has considerable implications for the prices and availability of physical commodities over a period of 6 to 12 months.,2022-01-01,
