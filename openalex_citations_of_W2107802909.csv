Risk spillovers between crude oil and agricultural commodities in India: Insights from two major global disruptions,"Abstract This study examines the dynamics of the integration of and risk transmission between India’s crude oil price index and nine agricultural commodity spot prices. The study uses daily price volatility data from June 2015 to December 2023 and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive framework to investigate short-term and long-term connectedness dynamics. The results show a strong relationship between crude oil and agricultural commodity prices in India. Soybean oil is a significant transmitter within the network, and crude oil emerges as a primary net recipient. The average total connectedness index (TCI) value was about 36 per cent, with 27 per cent in the short term and 8.9 per cent in the long term. The average TCI value during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period was 32.6 per cent, and that during the Russia–Ukraine war period was 24.3 per cent, with volatility spillovers in the network occurring primarily in the short term. Dynamic variations in connectedness over time highlight the impact of specific events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine war. This study identifies the net transmitters and net receivers of volatility shocks within a network, providing insights that can help with portfolio diversification and strategic decision-making.",2025-04-11,
Commodity Spillovers and Risk Hedging: The Evolving Role of Gold and Oil in the Indian Stock Market,"This study examines the volatility and hedging effectiveness of commodities, specifically gold and oil, on the Indian stock market, focusing on both aggregate and sectoral indices. Data have been collected from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024 to cover the post-COVID-19 period. Utilizing the Asymmetric Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ADCC-GARCH) model, we analyze the volatility spillovers and time-varying correlations between commodity and stock market returns. The analysis of spillover connectedness reveals that both commodities exhibit limited and inconsistent hedging potential. Gold demonstrates low and stable spillovers in most sectors, indicating its diminished role as a reliable safe-haven asset in Indian markets. Oil shows relatively higher but volatile spillover effects, particularly with sectors closely tied to energy and industrial activities, reflecting its dependence on external economic and geopolitical factors. This study contributes to the literature by providing a sector-specific perspective on commodity–stock market interactions, challenging conventional assumptions of hedging efficiency of gold and oil. It also emphasizes the need to explore alternative hedging mechanisms for risk management in the post-crisis phase.",2025-04-08,
Volatility Modeling of the Impact of Geopolitical Risk on Commodity Markets,"This study analyses the impact of the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) on the volatility of commodity futures returns from 4 January 2010 to 30 June 2023, using Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) models. It expands the research scope to include precious metals, agricultural products, energy, and industrial metals. The study differentiates between the impacts of geopolitical threat events and actions using GPRACT and GPRTHREAT indicators. Findings reveal that negative geopolitical shocks increase commodity returns’ volatility more than positive shocks. Specifically, gold, silver, and natural gas are negatively affected, while wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, zinc, nickel, lead, WTI oil, and Brent oil experience positive effects. Platinum, cocoa, coffee, and copper show no significant impact. These insights highlight the importance of geopolitical risks on commodity market volatility and returns, aiding in risk management and portfolio diversification. Policymakers, financial market stakeholders, and investors can leverage these findings to better understand the GPR’s relationship with commodity markets and develop effective strategies.",2025-03-26,
Topological Properties of International Commodity Market: How Uncertainty Affects the Linkages?,"ABSTRACT The study aims to explore the network topology of the international commodity market by examining the interconnections among 21 commodity futures across various categories, including energy, precious and industrial metals, and agriculture. We analyze the market structure of these commodity futures under both low and high uncertainty conditions to assess whether uncertainty impacts the commodity market structure. To do this, we employ the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) and Hierarchical Tree (HT) methods. Our empirical findings, based on data from January 2014 to March 2023, reveal that energy commodities are not positioned at the center of the market; rather, agricultural commodities take this central role. In terms of uncertainty, the commodity market topology during periods of high uncertainty is more integrated than during times of low uncertainty, indicating that higher uncertainty leads to a more synchronized movement of commodities. These insights provide valuable guidance for traders, investors, and policymakers.",2025-03-22,
Financialization and Learning About the Persistence of Shocks,"Oil market participants depend on inventories data to learn about the current and future oil market conditions, and thus infer the persistence of realized shocks. We argue that financialization has made such learning more challenging. When financial investors trade oil for reasons unrelated to oil fundamentals, they introduce non-fundamental noise to the futures market, creating a wedge between futures and spot prices. Exploiting this wedge, arbitrageurs simultaneously trade futures contracts and store physical oil, thus propagating non-fundamental noise to inventories and making them a nosier indicator of oil market fundamentals. We develop a tractable dynamic model that features permanent and temporary fundamental shocks, storage, and a complex oil financial market. Using the model, we show that financialization makes temporary shocks more likely to be perceived as persistent. We also establish a connection between the maturity of futures contracts targeted by naive investors and the informativeness of futures prices and inventories. We believe that our mechanism played a key role in amplifying oversupply fears in 2015. JEL Classification: D82, G14, Q02.",2025-03-13,
U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND AGRICULTURAL MARKET VOLATILITY. IS THERE A “TRUMP EFFECT” ON GRAIN COMMODITIES?,"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election and the so-called “Trump effect” on the volatility of agricultural commodity prices, with a particular focus on corn, wheat, soybeans, and oats. To evaluate the market’s reaction to political uncertainty, a 10-day election window (October 30 – November 12, 2024) was compared with a similar pre-election period (October 16 – October 29, 2024), with Election Day serving as the transition point. The study hypothesizes that the 2024 U.S. presidential election had a statistically significant impact on the volatility of agricultural commodity prices, reflecting changes in market expectations. This hypothesis was tested using the F-test, analyzing differences in variance between these periods. Daily price data for the analyzed agricultural commodities were obtained from the Datastream database. The results indicate that the 2024 U.S. presidential election had a varied impact on commodity market volatility. The F-test results confirm a significant increase in volatility in the wheat and oats markets, whereas corn and soybeans remained relatively stable. Descriptive statistics further support these observations, showing higher variance and standard deviation for wheat and oats during the election period, suggesting increased price fluctuations. Conversely, corn and soybeans exhibited lower variance and standard deviation, indicating reduced sensitivity to election-related uncertainty. Notably, wheat recorded a significant increase in its average return, while oats experienced a price decline, highlighting the differentiated sensitivity of individual commodities to political events. These findings contribute to the broader discussion on the impact of political uncertainty on commodity markets, emphasizing the need for risk management strategies during periods of heightened volatility.",2025-03-11,
"Price factors in the corn market: technical, fundamental and seasonal aspects","The article explores the key price factors influencing the market value formation of corn, focusing on fundamental, technical, and seasonal aspects. A detailed analysis of supply and demand, export-import operations, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory restrictions has been conducted as critical components of fundamental price formation. Special attention is paid to the impact of production levels, external economic trends, agricultural policies, and changing climate conditions, which shape the overall context of price formation in the corn market. A significant part of the study is dedicated to technical analysis, including the use of moving averages, support and resistance levels, and market indicators (RSI, MACD) to identify entry and exit points in the market. The correlation between corn prices and other financial assets is also examined, helping to understand potential market movements. The article also examines the seasonal dynamics of corn prices, considering historical patterns and the influence of weather conditions on yields. The cyclical nature of the corn market, which is observed throughout the year, allows for price trend predictions, which is crucial for farmers, traders, and analysts working in the agricultural market. The findings confirm that an integrated approach to corn market analysis — combining fundamental, technical, and seasonal approaches — significantly enhances the effectiveness of risk management in the agricultural commodity market. Practical recommendations are provided on how to apply the results to optimize hedging strategies, forecast price fluctuations, and make effective trading decisions. These strategies help minimize potential losses and ensure stability in the corn market, providing better decision-making tools for stakeholders in the agricultural industry. Keywords: pricing, corn, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, seasonality, market factors, hedging, agricultural sector.",2025-01-29,
ChatGPT and Commodity Return,"ABSTRACT This paper investigates the ability of a ChatGPT‐based indicator to forecast excess returns of the commodity futures index. Using ChatGPT to extract information from over 2.5 million articles from nine international newspapers, we demonstrate that our constructed commodity news ratio index significantly predicts future commodity returns, both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample. Furthermore, it outperforms traditional textual analysis methods, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Bag‐of‐Words (BoW), while indicating economic significance within an asset allocation framework. The results highlight the critical role of ChatGPT in forecasting commodity market dynamics and provide valuable insights for both financial market participants and researchers.",2025-01-27,
The effect of commodity index trading in agricultural futures markets: a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) approach,"Abstract Commodity index trading in futures markets is a relatively new investment strategy whose consequences are not fully understood. This paper tests the hypothesis that long-only, passive index trading in agricultural futures markets influences futures prices. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models are a common empirical research approach for analyzing index trading. Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR) models are a new approach to analyzing index trading. FAVAR models can incorporate a large data set into the traditional VAR framework. Using a FAVAR model improves the analysis by including additional market factors relevant to futures price formation. Models were estimated for 13 agricultural commodities (corn, soybean, soybean oil, soybean meal, soft red winter wheat, hard red winter wheat, cotton, cocoa, sugar, coffee, live cattle, feeder cattle, and lean hog) from January 2006 to December 2022. The results demonstrate the added value of FAVAR models in explaining the dynamics between prices and index trading. The conclusions are similar to other findings that prices lead index positions; however, adding demand-related data through a FAVAR model allows for a better understanding of market dynamics.",2025-01-23,
Commodity Dependence and Optimal Asset Allocation,"ABSTRACT We present a model to explain the diversification benefits of incorporating commodities into a portfolio of traditional assets from the perspective of domestic investors. Utilizing a sample of 38 countries from 2000 to 2020, we show that investors in high‐commodity dependence countries generally do not benefit from adding commodities to their portfolios while investors located in low‐commodity dependence countries usually do. Our results thus show that local contexts matter and that commodities may augment a diversified portfolio if investors are not excessively exposed to commodity risk through their country's economic structure.",2025-01-20,
Commodity Futures Characteristics and Asset Pricing Models,"ABSTRACT A latent‐factor model based on the instrumented principal component analysis (IPCA) methodology of Kelly et al. outperforms existing factor models in explaining cross‐sectional variations in commodity futures returns. The model allows for observed commodity futures characteristics to work as instruments for unobservable dynamic factor loadings. We find that the relationship between characteristics and commodity futures returns is driven by compensation for exposure to latent risk factors (beta) rather than compensation for exposure to mispricing (alpha). Three latent factors deliver more powerful explanations than any number of observable factors. Among a collection of 20 characteristics, only three are significantly related to latent factor betas. These three characteristics are momentum, expected shortfall, and idiosyncratic volatility.",2025-01-20,
Causality relationship between economic policy uncertainty and tourism in Mediterranean countries: Evidence from dynamic symmetric and asymmetric bootstrap panel causality tests,"This study analyses the interrelationship between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and tourism in Mediterranean Basin countries for the period 1997–2020. The paper includes two analyses along with two models. The first analysis investigates a long-run relationship between variables and estimates long-run coefficients by using the Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR) technique, a novel approach that provides more comprehensive insights. The second analysis examines the dynamic relationship between the variables by dynamic Kónya panel symmetric and asymmetric causality tests. According to the MM-QR estimation results, the effect of EPU on international tourist arrivals (ITA) in Model I is positive across all quantiles (except at the 0.1 quantile), and this positive effect increases with quantile level. In Model II, the effect of ITA on EPU is positive for most of the quantiles (except at the 0.8 and 0.9 quantiles). However, it is statistically significant only for countries in the 0.2 quantile group. The dynamic symmetric causality findings indicate a causal relationship from tourism to EPU (except for Spain) and from EPU to tourism for all countries. The dynamic asymmetric causality test reveals an asymmetric causality in the positive component from tourism to EPU in various periods across countries (except for Greece). In the positive component from EPU to tourism, we observed causality relationships in France and Spain (in a single period) and in Greece and Italy (across multiple periods). It is first study in the literature to examine the causal relationship between EPU and tourism by using dynamic symmetric and asymmetric bootstrap panel causality tests, with a focus on Mediterranean Basin countries. It therefore addresses a significant gap in literature. It is found that there is strong sensitivity in the relationship between tourism and EPU, hence policymakers must carefully calibrate their strategies when assessing the interaction between these two critical factors.",2025-01-15,
The Determinants of Marginal Convenience Yield in Agricultural Commodity Markets,"Abstract We report a significant downward trend in the convenience yield for holding physical inventory in agricultural commodity futures markets, attributing this negative trend to speculative demand shocks, which in turn, leads in decreasing agricultural convenience yields. Moreover, agricultural convenience yields appear negative on average during the recent financialization (of commodities) period. We additionally show that the response of agricultural convenience yields to commodity price uncertainty and supply shocks is much less pronounced in magnitude and persistence compared to that of hedging demand shocks. Overall, our analysis verifies the Keynesian theory of normal backwardation by showing a long‐lasting positive response of agricultural convenience yields to a hedging demand shock, thereby leaving the hedging demand as the most significant factor explaining the less frequently observed backwardations in agricultural futures markets.",2025-01-14,
"Financial contagion in the US, European and Chinese stock markets during global shocks","Under globalisation, integration, and financialisation of national economies, the financial markets’ interdependence tends to swell, which increases the probability of financial disturbances spreading between countries, especially during global shocks, and calls for the development of new standards of financial regulation. The article studies the financial contagion among stock markets of different countries during global shocks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, and the special military operation of Russia in Ukraine (SMO). The concept of financial contagion underlies the methodology of the research. The financial contagion is diag nosed based on the construction of DCC-GARCH models and the calculation of dy namic conditional beta coefficients. Causal relationships in the interaction of indices are established using the Granger test. The data are average daily indices: the Ameri can S&amp;P 500, the European STOXX 600, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index – for December 2018 – March 2024 obtained from the financial portal Investing.com. The study reveals a high level of connectivity in normal times between the American and European stock markets with some autonomy of the Chinese stock market. However, during the 2020 pandemic, there was a short-term strong contagion of the S&amp;P 500 and STOXX 600 from the SSE Composite Index, as well as longer-term, moderate cross-contagion between the S&amp;P 500 and STOXX 600. During the 2021 energy crisis and SMO, there was strong and relatively long-lasting contagion of the S&amp;P 500 from the STOXX 600 and their much weaker contagion from the SSE Composite Index. The findings may be useful for stock market players in managing investment portfolios, and for the state in formulating financial stabilisation policies during the impact of global shocks.",2025-01-13,
"Macroeconomic Conditions, Speculation, and Commodity Futures Returns","This paper examines the dynamic relationships between speculative activities, commodity returns, and macroeconomic conditions across five sectors compassing 29 commodities. Using weekly data spanning from January 2000 to July 2023, we construct comprehensive measures of commodity market speculation across five sectors and examine their sector-specific impact on returns through advanced econometric methods, including dynamic conditional correlation models, quantile regressions, Markov-switching models, and time-varying Granger causality tests. Our results reveal that the impact of speculative activities on commodity futures returns is conditional on the commodity sector and prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, the relationship between macroeconomic factors, speculative activities, and commodity futures returns is time varying. Among the macroeconomic variables, the financial stress indicator, as measured by the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index, shows a significant ability to predict commodity futures returns. The relationship between speculation and commodity returns is bi-directional across all sectors.",2025-01-08,
Joint multifractality in cross-correlations between grains &amp; oilseeds indices and external uncertainties,"Abstract This study investigates the relationships between agricultural spot markets and external uncertainties through multifractal detrending moving-average cross-correlation analysis (MF-X-DMA). The dataset contains the Grains &amp; Oilseeds Index (GOI) and its five subindices for wheat, maize, soyabeans, rice, and barley. Moreover, we use three uncertainty proxies, namely, economic policy uncertainty (EPU), geopolitical risk (GPR), and Volatility Index (VIX). We observe multifractal cross-correlations between agricultural markets and uncertainties. Furthermore, statistical tests reveal that maize has intrinsic joint multifractality with all the uncertainty proxies, highly sensitive to external shocks. Additionally, intrinsic multifractality among GOI-GPR, wheat-GPR, and soyabeans-VIX is illustrated. However, other series have apparent multifractal cross-correlations with high probabilities. Moreover, our analysis suggests that among the three types of external uncertainties, GPR has the strongest association with grain prices, excluding maize and soyabeans.",2025-01-04,
"Spillover Nexus among Green Cryptocurrency, Sectoral Renewable Energy Equity Stock and Agricultural Commodity: Implications for Portfolio Diversification","Abstract In recent decades, the rising challenges posed by climate change have prompted investors to take a keen interest in green assets and incorporate them into their portfolios to achieve optimal returns. Therefore, this article explores the static and dynamic connectedness between renewable energy stocks (solar, wind, and geothermal), green cryptocurrencies (Stellar, Nano, Cardona, and IOTA), and agricultural commodities (wheat, cocoa, coffee, corn, cotton, sugar, and soybean) using the TVP-VAR (time-varying parameter vector autoregression) framework offering novel empirical evidence for investors and portfolio managers. The connectedness is examined across two distinct sub-samples: during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 times. Because the relevant connectedness can have implications for diversification benefits, we proceed with the computation of optimal weights, hedge ratios, and hedge effectiveness using the DCC-GARCH model. The main findings are as follows: We first find that green cryptocurrencies particularly Cardona and Stellar exhibit the highest spillovers to the network and wind energy stock has the least connectedness with the other markets. Second, the dynamic NET spillover indices reveal that cotton, cocoa, and coffee are consistently net receivers over the entire period except in the beginning of the pandemic. Third, renewable energy stocks exhibit diverse positions implying that the impact of the pandemic has varied significantly across the sectors. Finally, agricultural commodity depicts greater weights in the pandemic period under scoring the benefit of a diversified portfolio consisting of agriculture and green assets.",2025-01-01,
Term Structure and Risk Premiums of Commodity Futures With Linear Regressions,"ABSTRACT We apply the regression‐based affine term structure model to estimate the term structure of commodity futures. This model is advantageous in that it has a simple and fast algorithm, can accommodate a variety of observable and unspanned factors, and can be applied to daily and even real‐time observations. The results show that the model appropriately captures time‐series variations across different maturities and exhibits satisfactory performance in capturing cross‐sectional variations for specific months. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the existing commodity risk factor returns and the risk premiums inferred by the model. Our analysis reveals that different risk factor returns explain the spot and term premiums differently. Therefore, using the advantages of the model, we can better understand the term structure and risk premiums in commodity futures.",2024-12-24,
What Drives Commodity Price Variation?,"Abstract We investigate the importance of time-varying discount rates for commodity prices using an index based on twenty-three commodities for the period 1959–2024. We show that in commodities markets, unlike other financial markets, time variation in discount rates plays a much smaller role. Instead, prices forecast cash flows as well as discount rates. A high price for a commodity today, measured as a low percentage net convenience yield, forecasts both a high future convenience yield and a low expected return. For longer horizons, variation in percentage net convenience yields seems mainly driven by net convenience yield growth, making commodities much closer to the classical textbook view of price changes representing news about cash flows.",2024-11-25,
“El Niño” and “La Niña”: Revisiting the impact on food commodity prices and euro area consumer prices,"This paper challenges the prevailing assumption that the intensification of the weather phenomena known as El Niño and La Niña generally exert upward and downward pressures, respectively, on international food commodity prices that, in turn, affect consumer prices even in distant jurisdictions such as Europe. As regards the first point, we show that there are nuances that have to do with composition effects (the type of commodity) and sample periods (more recent decades present a different frequency of weather events, with producers having adopted mitigation strategies over time), in such a way that the impact is weaker nowadays and, in some cases, may even change sign (for some commodities, depending on the period of reference). With regard to the second point, and focusing on consumer price inflation in the euro area and its four largest constituent countries (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), we show that it is crucial to account for the mitigating and sample-period-specific role of domestic agricultural policies (in the euro area, the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy, CAP). To carry out our analysis, we construct a detailed database for the 1970–2023 period and use a local projections empirical framework. Among other results, we show that when using a sample period that starts at the time of the creation of the euro area (in the late 1990s), an intensification of El Niño actually decreases euro area headline inflation by about 0.3 percentage points (pp) after 12 months, while La Niña increases it by 0.6 pp over the same horizon. We explain our results on the basis of the aforementioned factors: composition effects, sample periods, and the CAP.",2024-10-03,
TAIL DEPENDENCE OF COMMODITY FUTURES RETURNS IN THE AGRICULTURAL AND ENERGY SECTORS,"The goal of this research was to examine tail dependence structures between selected commodity futures returns. Tail dependence, called also extremal dependence, was evaluated for the pairs of commodities coming from the same sector (energy or agricultural). The study covers the years 2018-2023, embracing the COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. To achieve the goal, bivariate dynamic models were applied to percentage log returns of commodity futures. Marginal distributions were described using the ARMA-GARCH models. Joint distributions were constructed using the symmetrized Joe-Clayton copula, which allowed to model asymmetric dependence in the tails of a distribution. Time variation of the copula parameters, here equal to tail dependence coefficients, was described using the evolution equations [Patton 2006]. In the energy sector, the dependence in both tails of analyzed distributions was relatively strong, dynamic and higher in the lower tail than in the upper tail. On the contrary, the agricultural sector lacks common patterns of tail dependency. This feature of the agricultural sector creates an opportunity for investors or risk managers to build well-diversified portfolios.",2024-09-25,
Co‐Jump Dependency and Transmission Across US Commodity Futures: A Network Analysis,"ABSTRACT This paper examines the co‐jump transmission in 20 commodity futures returns in the United States using co‐jump network models. Specifically, it reveals co‐jumping behavior in both static and time‐varying settings, considering the overall commodity markets and various commodity groups separately, which helps us understand the dynamic changes in co‐jump dependencies at the overall and sector levels. The main results reveal that co‐jump heterogeneity exists among commodities but is generally more apparent within each commodity group, and co‐jumps vary over time. Gold exerts the strongest influence, with many commodity futures being influenced by the jumps behavior in gold returns. During the COVID‐19 outbreak and the Russia–Ukraine war, the energy group ranks highest in terms of co‐jump network centrality. Our empirical analysis highlights the portfolio performance and risk reduction, and an additional examination shows that centrality information from the co‐jump network contains a highly and statistically forecasting power for US stock market volatility.",2024-08-19,
Uma investigação sobre a influência da negociação de contratos futuros na volatilidade do preço à vista do açúcar,"O Brasil desempenha um papel crucial no mercado global de açúcar, sendo o principal produtor e exportador. Este estudo investiga o impacto do volume de negociação dos contratos futuros de açúcar na volatilidade dos preços à vista, abordando a relação entre os mercados futuros e à vista de commodities através da análise do volume de contratos negociados e em aberto do Sugar No 11 e o indicador do açúcar cristal branco à vista estipulado pelo CEPEA/ESALQ/USP. Utilizando testes de Causalidade de Granger e análise da variância do erro de previsão, a pesquisa analisa dados da década de 2012-2022. Os resultados indicam a ausência de evidências estatísticas suficientes para rejeitar a hipótese nula de falta de causalidade Granger. Isso sugere que, nas diferentes defasagens consideradas, não se pode afirmar com confiança a presença de causalidade temporal entre as séries analisadas.",2024-08-14,
Tail risk spillover of commodity futures markets,"Abstract This paper examines the tail risk spillover in commodity futures markets, with a particular focus on the dynamics related to the Chinese markets. To overcome the limitations of conventional network methods in terms of dimensionality, we employ a bootstrap‐based probabilistic analysis to extend the Diebold–Yilmaz network model for measuring spillover effects. Our empirical results demonstrate both intra‐ and inter‐group tail risk connectedness among commodity futures, highlighting variations in such connectedness during crisis periods. Additionally, we find the tail risk spillover between commodity spot and futures markets and identify dominant sources of risk transmission through our probabilistic analysis.",2024-08-12,
"How do commodity futures respond to Ukraine–Russia, Taiwan Strait and Hamas–Israel crises? – An analysis using event study approach","Purpose The purpose of this study investigates the short-term market reaction of three commodity futures indices for four recent events of high geopolitical risk: the Ukraine–Russia war, the Taiwan Strait crisis and the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. Design/methodology/approach The author examines three commodity futures indices at and around the beginning of four recent events of high geopolitical risk using an event study methodology. Findings The results show a positive abnormal return for the commodity futures indices for three of the four recent events considered in the analysis. The exception in terms of abnormal returns observed is the visit of US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan on August 2, 2022, which resulted in statistically significant negative abnormal returns in the commodity futures around the visit. The other three geopolitical events, by causing an increase of uncertainty level and supply-side constraints, led to a rise in the price of most commodity futures. This allowed commodity-exporting countries to achieve positive and statistically significant abnormal returns. Policy implications of our findings are discussed. Originality/value The effect of high geopolitical risk events on commodity futures indices has been relatively little examined in the financial theory. This study intends to fill this gap in the literature.",2024-08-09,
Commodity Futures Market Conditions and Climate Policy Risk: Evidence From Energy and Metals Markets,"ABSTRACT This study investigates the impact of climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on energy and metal commodity futures markets by employing quantile regression, which accounts for various (bearish, normal, and bullish) markets. Our results reveal that the impact of CPU shocks is heterogeneous and market condition‐specific. Particularly, CPU exerts a significantly negative effect on all commodities, except natural gas, in a bearish market. Under a normal market, the impact of CPU on energy returns varies across commodities whereas for a bullish market, the CPU effect is mixed. The results also reveal natural gas to be a good hedge instrument for climate policy risk. We further conducted channel analysis using the theory of storage and hedging pressure hypothesis. The key finding reveals inventory level as the transmission channel of climate policy risk. Our findings have implications for the inventory management strategies of producers and suggest that regulators should consider market‐based policies in their decarbonization efforts.",2024-07-23,
An Applied Study of the Symmetric and Asymmetric Impact of Oil Prices and International Financial Markets on Economic Growth in Iraq,"Iraq, one of the main oil exporting nations, is extremely susceptible to changes in the price of oil. This article attempts to investigate how the price of oil affects the way the Iraqi economy performs, as indicated by a number of factors (economic growth and international financial markets). We will apply econometric techniques in both linear and non-linear frameworks to accomplish this goal. To represent NARDL non-linearities in the relationship between the aforementioned economic variables, we will first look for linear cointegrating correlations and/or estimate ARDL models. If necessary, we will next use threshold cointegration. Thus, we demonstrate that, independent of the regime we are in, the asymmetry associated with the shock's sign is confirmed over the span January 2006–December 2020. Regarding the asymmetry associated with the shock's magnitude, it is only confirmed under the ""below oil price threshold regime."" In the ""above oil price threshold regime,"" yields respond in a way that is proportionate to the shock's magnitude. Additionally, we demonstrate that the asymmetry associated with the shock's sign is confirmed during times of negative industrial output growth, while the influence of shocks looks symmetrical during times of positive industrial production variation.",2024-07-05,
"Total, quantile, and frequency risk transmission among metal commodities","Abstract This study investigates the total, quantile, and frequency risk transmission among five widely traded metals namely copper, gold, lead, silver, and zinc using forecast error variance decomposition. The analysis spans from 1 January 2002, to 30 June 2023. Our findings reveal that the total connectedness index (TCI) changed over time, indicating sensitivity to time‐specific developments and major events during different periods. The TCI is influenced more by extreme positive or negative shocks, as the lower and upper quantile TCIs are higher compared to the medium quantile TCI. Furthermore, the short‐term TCIs exhibit higher values than the medium‐ and long‐term TCIs. These variations imply that the TCI is influenced by different types of shocks or mechanisms across different quantiles. Specifically, the short‐term TCIs are driven by global economic policy uncertainty, real global economic activity, and the geopolitical risk index (GPR). However, the medium‐ and long‐term TCIs are solely influenced by the GPR.",2024-07-01,
Nonlinear price transmission and asynchronous price bubbles: empirical evidence from China’s agricultural futures and spot markets,"Previous studies on commodity price bubbles mainly focused on futures markets and ignored the performance of spot markets. Using the price data for corn and soybeans in China, this study identifies the exact bubble dates for the futures and spot markets, and finds asynchronous price bubbles between these two markets. Bubbles are more frequent for commodity spot prices, while the corresponding futures prices still dominate the process of price discovery. Further analysis reveals that, the lack of (immediate) linear transmission between the cointegrated prices may have inhibited bubble synchronization, and caused more spot price bubbles. The nonlinear transmission effects between the futures and spot prices suggest the existence of speculative storage and market power. This may further explain why spot price bubbles cannot be arbitraged away.",2024-06-19,
"Emissions Prices, Commodity Futures, Equity Prices, and Geopolitical Risks Dependence Structure: Implications for Portfolio Diversification","This study examines the short- and medium-run dependence structures across carbon emissions prices, commodity futures, equity prices, and geopolitical uncertainty in the case of the BRICS countries. Previous studies have focused on the co-movement between commodity futures and equity prices, with a few attempts at capturing the economic uncertainty in that relationship but failed to look at the broader context of both emission prices and geopolitical uncertainty. This study employs the spillover index developed by Diebold and Yilmaz and data spaning from January 3, 2008, to October 31, 2021 to identify the dependence structure across ETS, commodity futures, equity prices, and geopolitical uncertainty (GPR). Our key findings suggest that the contribution of the MOEX Russia Index to the natural gas prices return is the highest. As the ETS is concerned, the GPR of China plays the most crucial role compared to other BRICS countries. Comparing energy commodities (e.g. ETS and natural gas), the net pairwise spillover effects of oil to metal commodities are more evident. Among the GPRs of BRICS countries, China, India, Russia, and Brazil have a positive net pairwise directional connectedness transmitted to South Africa. For stakholders working in commodity trading, the insights obtained from this research is essential for developing strategies that lessen the effects of geopolitical risks and help in promoting more resilient and stable commodity markets.",2024-06-12,
"COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices and Saudi stock market: empirical evidence from ARDL modeling and Bayer–Hanck cointegration approach","Abstract In 2020, the world experienced several significant events, including the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the collapse of international crude oil prices. The rapid spread of this pandemic has dramatic impacts on financial markets all over the world, thereby increasing market risk aversion in an unprecedented way since the subprime financial crisis. The decline in stock markets implied volatilities of equity and oil prices, thereby heightening turmoil in global financial markets despite comprehensive and substantial financial reforms. To this end, we investigated the likely effects of this pandemic on the Saudi stock market while controlling for oil prices based on daily data for a period from 1/1/2020 to 19/9/2022. To ascertain the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables, we applied autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modeling and the error correction model, with this ultimately revealing the existence of strong cointegration in the long run. The ARDL bounds test was found to be robust by combined cointegration tests, thus providing further evidence of a strong relationship in the long run. Granger causality tests also yielded evidence of causality between the variables in both directions. The total COVID-19 confirmed cases and oil prices also caused movements in stock returns in the short run. Our findings have some prominent implications for asset managers and policymakers to improve stock market efficiency and boost global economic activity. Saudi authorities can consequently remove the regulatory and legal obstacles to develop their stock market and better improve the risk management, which will allow to make quick decisions in response to any oil price volatilities. Policymakers should also adopt proactive strategies that can comfort stock investors’ anxieties over the increasing oil price volatilities. Finally, the findings should be treated with some cautions because of the limited sample size and the tests’ statistical inference. Nevertheless, they do open opportunities for further studies to look in more detail at how the COVID-19 pandemic affected, over the short and long run, monetary and fiscal policy coordination, financial stability, and various other macroeconomic indicators in Saudi Arabia.",2024-06-03,
Hedging basic materials equity portfolios using gold futures,"Commodities can be treated as an alternative investment, a hedging strategy, or a diversification opportunity. Various types of commodities, especially metals, usually are not strongly affected by inflation, and the trends of their prices are not correlated with other investment instruments. To participate in the metals area of the commodity market, an investor can buy shares of companies from the basic materials sector. Such companies are involved in discovering, developing, and processing raw materials. However, as not all the companies from the basic materials sector deal with precious metals, it is worth adding gold futures to such a portfolio. The aim of this paper is to compare a portfolio of the basic materials sector stocks against a similar portfolio hedged with gold. Our findings revealed that hedging a commodities’ portfolio with gold minimizes both profits and losses and can be suitable for risk-averse investors. The research results can be applied by individual investors and investment managers to choose the most appropriate investment approach.",2024-06-01,
Dampak Spillover Antara Harga Komoditas dan Dinamika Pasar Keuangan,"Background: Interconnectedness among finacial and commodity prices beyond what can be explained by fundamentals, saw a significant rise from 2004 to 2008, reaching their highest point during the global financial crisis. The problem of this research addresses the increasing interdependence and volatility caused by financialization.Purpose: This study examines the complex spillover effects between financial markets and commodity prices from January 2021 to March 2024.Design/methodology/approach: This study employs two approaches: a qualitative approach through a systematic literature review (SLR) and a quantitative approach. Using data from major stock indices and key, we employed Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models to analyze the dynamics.Findings/Result: The study literature indicates a lack of research comprehensive analysis of the spillover effects between financial and commodity markets. Results indicate significant impacts of stock market shocks, particularly in the U.S., on energy prices, and the substantial influence of commodity market fluctuations on the Hong Kong stock market. Conclusion: These findings highlight the critical role of financial markets in driving commodity price volatility and emphasize the need for strategic portfolio diversification and robust risk management. Continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies are essential to mitigate cross-market impacts and ensure market stability, providing valuable insights for policymakers and market participants.Originality/value (State of the art): The value of this research lies in its focus on the recent period, its use of a mixed method approach, and its identification of specific impacts of market shocks on different instruments. Keywords: commodity prices, financial markets, spillover effect, systematic literature review, Vector Autoregressive model",2024-05-31,
Does “Paper Oil” Matter? Energy Markets’ Financialization and Co-Movements with Equity Markets,"We revisit, and document new facts regarding, the financialization of U.S. energy markets in 2000–2010. We show that, after controlling for macroeconomic factors and physical energy market fundamentals, the strength of energy markets’ co-movements with the U.S. stock market is positively related to the energy paper market activity of hedge funds that trade both asset classes. This relation weakens when credit risk is elevated. We find, in contrast, no link with the aggregate positions of commodity index traders in energy futures markets. Our findings have implications for the ongoing debate regarding the financialization of commodities.",2024-05-23,
Commodity Market Risk: Examining Price Co-Movements in the Pakistan Mercantile Exchange,"Commodity price co-movements significantly impact investment decisions. High correlations constrain portfolio diversification and limit risk mitigation potential. While international markets often exhibit strong price linkages, understanding national-level dynamics is crucial for effective portfolio optimization. In this paper, we examine the commodity price co-movements within three key sectors—energy, metals, and agriculture—in the specific context of Pakistan. Utilizing data from 13 January 2013 to 20 August 2020 and employing an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, we reveal a surprising finding: co-movement among these sectors is weak and primarily short-term. This challenges the conventional assumption of tight coupling in national markets and offers exciting implications for investors. Our analysis suggests that Pakistani commodities hold significant diversification potential, opening promising avenues for risk-reduction strategies within the national market.",2024-05-22,
Evolving roles of energy futures markets: A Survey,"Energy markets are important in global trade and economic stability, and energy futures play a critical role in energy market dynamics. This study reviews: i) the important role energy futures market prices play as reliable forecasts of future spot prices for energy commodities; ii) the connectedness of energy futures and spot markets; iii) how energy futures markets facilitate managing exposure to energy price risk; iv) the systemic influence of energy futures prices and volatility on other markets and how this influence frequently surges during crises. Our survey provides economic insights for energy market participants and policymakers.",2024-05-21,
Financialization of commodity markets: New evidence from temporal and spatial domains,"Abstract To address the ongoing contention surrounding the impact of financialization, this study adopts a ripple‐spreading network model to analyze the transmission of information across 13 globally significant commodity markets. By juxtaposing the pre‐ and postfinancialization periods, notable disparities in spillover magnitude are discerned, with overall effects registering at 58% and 85%, respectively. Moreover, the postfinancialization period exhibits accelerated spillover dynamics, necessitating a reduced timeframe (less than 1000 units) in contrast to the prefinancialization period (approximately 2000 units). Furthermore, a heightened interconnectedness among energy, metal, and agricultural futures is evident in the postfinancialization period. These findings furnish compelling evidence regarding the ramifications of financialization on commodity markets.",2024-05-20,
Dynamic linkages in agricultural and energy markets: A quantile impulse response approach,"Abstract This article investigates the dynamic linkages between agricultural and energy markets, with a focus on an econometric analysis of multivariate stochastic dynamics based on the joint distribution of state variables. The analysis relies on a quantile approach followed by the evaluation of a copula. Applied to nonlinear price dynamics, the approach is flexible and supports a general evaluation of impulse response functions representing how prices adjust over time and across markets in response to a given shock. The analysis allows for arbitrary distribution functions; it captures own‐price and cross‐price dynamics that can depend on the nature of shocks; and it also allows current changes to affect all moments of the future price distributions. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated in an econometric investigation of dynamic linkages in US corn, ethanol, and crude oil markets. We show how price adjustments can vary across quantiles, reflecting different speeds of adjustments depending on market conditions. We find evidence of nonlinear dynamics specific to the tails of the price distributions. We uncover evidence of positive contemporaneous codependence, especially tail dependence. We show how price shocks affect mean, variance, skewness as well as kurtosis of future price distributions. These results stress the importance of going beyond a standard mean‐variance analysis. They also shed new light on the deep linkages existing in the food‐fuel nexus.",2024-05-08,
"Analyzing Nexus between Crude Oil, Gold, Dollar and Equity Markets with Structural Break: ARDL Evidence from India","This paper explores the price relations between the Crude oil, Gold, US dollar, and equities during several economic episodes. The long- and short-term causal relationships between asset markets are examined in this study. The research uses a ‘Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)’ and an ‘Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL)’ bounds test to examine monthly data from April 1999 to March 2022. The results demonstrate the weak connections between asset markets throughout the different sample periods. Furthermore, the integration of most markets is uneven and changes over time. The currency and equity markets are adjusting to the long-run equilibrium only at a slow pace. We suggest that systematic risk factors must be taken into account while jointly modeling market linkages. This study improves on previous research in the subject by demonstrating the time-varying effects of asset price links on portfolio optimizations in different economic episodes.",2024-05-08,
Will the financialisation of agricultural products exacerbate food security risks? Empirical analysis from major grain-producing countries worldwide,"Based on data from 10 countries from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CBOT) wheat futures market for the period from 2000 to 2021, this study examines the impact of the financialisation of agricultural products on food security and its mechanism of action. We found that the higher the degree of financialisation of agricultural products, the stronger the negative effect on food security, which is more prominent after the financial crisis in 2008, and the effect on developing countries is more obvious than that on developed countries. The test results of the mediation effect model showed that the financialisation of agricultural products affects food security by increasing the volatility of futures prices. The test results of the moderating effect model showed that the rise of the US dollar index and loose monetary policy will exacerbate the impact of the financialisation of agricultural products on food security. Still, the increase of the self-sufficiency rate of food can effectively inhibit this impact. The study's conclusions supported the government's optimising macro policies and promoting food security.",2024-04-25,
"Food, energy, and water nexus: A study on interconnectedness and trade-offs","This study finds interesting outcomes regarding the interlinkage between the food, energy, and water sectors. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization data from January 1961 till January 2023 are employed for six variables, namely Total Renewable Water resources per capita (TRW), Total Internal Renewable Water resources per capita (TIRW), Total Water Withdrawal per capita (TWW), Global Food Consumption per capita (GFC), Global Crop Production (GCP), and Global Electricity Consumption (GEC). Employing Quantile Vector Auto-Regression (QVAR) methodology, we observe asymmetry in connectedness across quantiles. Positive shocks produce stronger impacts in the variables than negative ones. Crop production mostly acts as a receiver of shocks. Renewable water is a consistent net emitter in all circumstances, while water withdrawal is crucial during negative shocks regime as well as in neutral time.",2024-04-04,
Price effects of commodity financialization: Review of the evidence,"Abstract Following the 2007/2008 financial crisis, the price effects of commodity financialization have become an important research topic. We review the empirical evidence, focusing on statistical approaches and econometric models, and find that (1) Granger‐causality tests are unable to establish a relationship between commodity futures prices and funds of financial investors, implying a lack of evidence that financialization influences commodity futures prices and (2) studies that use correlation and price spread analysis mostly report evidence of a significant price effect of financialization. Thus, the statistical and econometric approaches adopted by the various studies influence the empirical findings. In addition, data identification may have an impact since economic models and statistical techniques can be sensitive to slight differences in the dataset. Our study of the literature shows that the definition of financialization is open‐ended and ambiguous. A theoretical literature review on financialization could be the logical next step.",2024-03-27,
Oil Strikes Back: Trend Factors and Exchange Rates,"Abstract A well‐known puzzle in international finance is that, to predict exchange rate returns, existing predictive models often perform worse than the naive random walk (RW) model. In this paper, we construct an oil trend factor which performs better than the RW model. More importantly, an oil‐trend‐based dynamic trading strategy can generate superior economic values. This result holds in both developed and emerging markets, with different forecasting horizons, with different specifications of trend factors, and across different currencies. Finally, we explore the economic link for the powerful predictability of the oil trend factor.",2024-03-25,
Does oil spin the commodity wheel? Quantile connectedness with a common factor error structure across energy and agricultural markets,"Should investors and policy makers in agricultural markets consider oil market's incontestable impact on portfolio risk management? This paper investigates the time-varying market linkages between energy and agricultural commodities in the presence of two important exogenous shocks, viz., the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 2022 Russia–Ukraine military conflict. We use a novel time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model with a common factor error structure to estimate the tail connectedness between energy and agricultural commodities for the period December 31, 2019 to December 18, 2023. Our findings provide clear evidence of asymmetry in the volatility evolution. We determine that volatility spillover magnitudes are much stronger across quantiles than at the mean. We note that crude oil is the main transmitter of shocks in the system before the onset of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict at the lower tail of the distribution. While crude oil and natural gas transmit volatility in both pre- and post-conflict announcement periods. Furthermore, the 2022 Russia–Ukraine conflict is found to impact the transmission of volatility between energy and agricultural commodities. Numerous agricultural commodities are observed to shift their position from transmitters to receivers of volatility, and vice versa, due to the military conflict in Ukraine. Our causality results depict time-varying patterns in the connectedness between crude oil and other commodities. We determine that crude oil has varying impact on agricultural markets in pre- and post-conflict announcement periods. Commodities for which both conflicting countries are major world exports of, such as wheat, have notably increased their dependency on crude oil. Thus, we advise investors and policymakers in agricultural markets to seriously consider oil market's impact on portfolio risk management and monitoring policies.",2024-03-15,
Market- and future-level sentiment and futures returns in Chinese agricultural futures markets,"This study examines market and future-level sentiment in the Chinese agricultural futures market, distinguishing between contagious and idiosyncratic sentiment. Our analysis reveals that agricultural future-level sentiment is significantly affected by market-level futures and domestic stock market sentiment, particularly during bullish market conditions, while global stock market sentiment has minimal impact. Furthermore, we find that both market and future-level sentiment strongly and positively influence futures returns, with contagious and idiosyncratic sentiment exerting favorable influences, particularly in bullish markets. Our findings provide clear evidence of sentiment's impact on agricultural futures returns, offering valuable insights for regulators to identify potential market bubbles and implement effective sentiment regulation measures.",2024-03-15,
Metal and energy price uncertainties and the global economy,"We construct novel monthly measures of energy and metal price uncertainty based on the one-year-ahead price forecast dispersion for twenty commodities. Using a simple VAR model, we show both metal and energy price uncertainty shocks are contractionary for the world economy, and these results are largely robust to a battery of alternative specifications. However, our results highlight the differences between metal and energy price uncertainties, both in terms of their propagation channels, as well as the driving forces behind them. Counterfactual analysis reveals that metal price uncertainty has a mainly direct impact on global economic activity while the impact of energy price uncertainty is indirectly mediated through global financial and economic uncertainties. Variance decomposition shows fluctuations of both metal and energy price uncertainties are mainly self-driven, however global financial uncertainty plays a significant role in driving metal price uncertainty in the short run while global economic activity uncertainty plays a significant role in driving energy price uncertainty in the medium to long run.",2024-03-04,
Carbon Credits and Crude Oil: An Investigation of the Price Returns Interaction in the International Market,"Abstract This paper aims to verify the relationship between the international markets for crude oil and carbon credits. We studied the returns of prices practiced in these markets, focusing on the transmission of shocks between oil prices and carbon credit prices. The methodological approach used financial econometrics to study these variables’ risk and return relationships. Besides causality and cointegration hypothesis tests, the VECM and GARCH models were estimates. There is a short- and long-term interaction between these variables. The volatility models show a significant association between the volatilities of the two variables of interest. Fossil fuels, mainly crude oil, generate energy that has substantial restrictions. At the same time, the carbon credits market has shown significant growth that can contribute to the use of energy from fossil fuels with parsimony and responsibility. Studying these variables and their interactions contributes to understanding the importance of the carbon market.",2024-03-01,
Stock market bubbles and the realized volatility of oil price returns,"Using monthly data for the G7 countries from 1973 to 2020, we study whether stock market bubbles help to forecast out-of-sample the realized volatility of oil price returns. We use the Multi-Scale Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity Confidence Indicator (MS-LPPLS-CI) approach to identify both positive and negative bubbles in the short-, medium, and long-term. First, we successfully detect major crashes and rallies using the MS-LPPLS-CIs. Having established the relevance of the bubbles indicators, and given the large number of them, we use widely-studied shrinkage (Lasso, elastic net, ridge regression) approaches to estimate our forecasting models. We find that stock market bubbles have predictive value for realized volatility at a short to intermediate forecast horizon. The number of bubble predictors included in the penalized forecasting models tend to increase in the forecast horizon. We obtain our main finding for the various types of stock market bubbles, and for good and bad realized volatilities.",2024-02-27,
Financial regulatory arbitrage and the financialization of commodities,"Abstract We explore the effects of financial regulatory arbitrage on commodity pricing. We examine two types of financial arbitrage: capital‐control arbitrage , in which commodities are imported to circumvent capital controls and profit from disparities in interest rates between domestic and international markets, and dual‐track interest‐rate arbitrage , in which commodities are utilized as collateral to capitalize on domestic dual‐track interest‐rate spreads. Our findings demonstrate that both forms of arbitrage positively affect commodity price returns. However, they affect the inverse relationship between inventory and convenience yield differently. While capital‐control arbitrage can either amplify or weaken this relationship, dual‐track arbitrage makes it less negative.",2024-02-25,
The role of public information in the Brazilian live cattle market,"Commodities reports play a crucial role in access market information. In Brazil, one of the most relevant commodities is live cattle. Brazil holds significant positions in the meat market, being the largest exporter of meat, the second-largest producer, and the third-largest global consumer. The agricultural sector, particularly livestock, is a cornerstone of the Brazilian economy, contributing significantly to GDP, employment, and trade balance. The availability of information in the commodities market is critical for several reasons. First, accurate and timely information helps farmers and producers make informed decisions about production, investment, and resource allocation. Second, for traders and investors, market information reduces uncertainty, allowing for better risk management and strategic planning. Third, transparency in market information fosters trust and stability, which are essential for attracting both domestic and international investments. Considering the power of information for the market, this study focuses on analyzing the impact of information found in three national agricultural reports, Pesquisa Trimestral de Abates (IBGE), AgroConab (CONAB), and AgroMensal (CEPEA), on the formation of abnormal returns and volatility in the futures prices of Brazilian live cattle traded on the B3 Stock Exchange. Our research hypothesis was that the Brazilian cattle market is semi-efficient based on the analysis of these three public reports. Our results indicate the non-rejection of this hypothesis. Although we identified some abnormal returns, we cannot assert that they follow a consistent pattern with Fama's (1970) definition of semi-strong form efficiency. We employed the Event Study methodology, using Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) and GARCH methodologies. volatility are identified, in some cases, abnormal returns are observed. Considering that the information in these reports is a public good, this research contributes to the formulation of public policies to promote and improve information disclosed in the market, ensuring that public information ensures market efficiency. Enhanced market information can lead to more efficient price discovery, reduce market distortions, and support the overall development of the agricultural sector. Keywords: Live cattle; Futures returns; Market efficiency; Agricultural reports; CAR (Cumulative abnormal returns); GARCH.",2024-02-23,
Financialisation of the European Union Emissions Trading System and its influencing factors in quantiles,"Abstract This study analyses the financialisation of the carbon market and its possible external shocks, with a focus on the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), by investigating its quantile dependence and influence paths from stage three onwards. To achieve this, we construct a theoretical model of five factors related to the financialisation of the carbon market and empirically investigate the significant influencing factors and their influence paths under different quantiles using quantile group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and quantile regression models. We find that the price of WTI crude oil and the market risk‐aversion index have a significant effect on the financialisation of the EU ETS at extremely high quantiles. Factors such as the WTI crude oil price, precipitation, average share price of thermal power companies, and the federal funds rate have a statistically significant impact on the medium quantiles. However, we find no significant influence at extremely low quantiles, indicating that policy instruments are necessary to effectively regulate the operation of the carbon market. Therefore, it is crucial for carbon market stakeholders to pay close attention to these factors and adapt to changing market conditions.",2024-02-19,
CLIMATE RISKS AND PREDICTABILITY OF COMMODITY RETURNS AND VOLATILITY: EVIDENCE FROM OVER 750 YEARS OF DATA,"We analyze whether metrics of climate risks, as captured primarily by changes in temperature anomaly and its stochastic volatility (SV), can predict returns and volatility of 25 commodities, covering the overall historical period of 1258 to 2021. To this end, we apply a higher-order nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test to not only uncover potential in-sample predictability in the entire conditional distribution of commodity returns and volatility but also to account for nonlinearity and structural breaks which exist between commodity returns and the metrics of climate risks. We find that, unlike in the misspecified linear Granger causality tests, climate risks do predict commodity returns and volatility, though the impact on the latter is stronger, in terms of the coverage of the conditional distribution. Insights from our findings can benefit academics, investors, and policymakers in their decision-making.",2024-02-18,
Nexus between financialization of agricultural products and food security amid financial crisis: empirical insights from BRICS,"Purpose The study endeavors to explore whether the financialization of agricultural commodities, traditionally viewed as a catalyst for price volatility, has any repercussions on food security in BRICS economies. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis employs the examination of three agricultural commodities, namely wheat, maize and soybean. Utilizing data from the Chicago Board of Trade on futures trading for these commodities, we focus on parameters such as annual trading volume, annual open interest contracts and the ratio of annual trading volume to annual open interest contracts. The study spans the period 2000–2021, encompassing pre- and post-financial crisis analyses and specifically explores the BRICS countries namely the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. To scrutinize the connections between financialization indicators and food security measures, the analysis employs econometric techniques such as panel data regression analysis and a moderating effects model. Findings The results indicate that the financialization of agricultural products contributes to the heightened food price volatility and has adverse effects on food security in emerging economies. Furthermore, the study reveals that the impact of the financialization of agricultural commodities on food security was more pronounced in emerging nations after the global financial crisis of 2008 compared to the pre-crisis period. Research limitations/implications This paper seeks to draw increased attention to the financialization of agricultural commodities by presenting empirical evidence of its potential impact on food security in BRICS economies. The findings serve as a valuable guide for policymakers, offering insights to help them safeguard the security and availability of the world’s food supply. Originality/value Very few studies have explored the effect of financialization of agricultural commodities on food security covering a sample of developing economies, with sample period from 2000 to 2021, especially at the individual agriculture commodity level. Understanding the evolving effects of financialization is further improved by comparing pre and post-financial crisis times.",2024-02-16,
Multifractal Detrended Cross-Correlations between Green Bonds and Commodity Markets: An Exploration of the Complex Connections between Green Finance and Commodities from the Econophysics Perspective,"Green bonds represent a compelling financial innovation that presents a financial perspective solution to address climate change and promote sustainable development. On the other hand, the recent process of financialisation of commodities disrupts the dynamics of the commodity market, increasing its correlation with financial markets and raising the risks associated with commodities. In this context, understanding the dynamics of the interconnectivity between green bonds and commodity markets is crucial for risk management and portfolio diversification. This study aims to reveal the multifractal cross-correlations between green bonds and commodities by employing methods from statistical physics. We apply multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MFDCCA) to both return and volatility series, demonstrating that green bonds and commodities exhibit multifractal characteristics. The analysis reveals long-range power-law cross-correlations between these two markets. Specifically, volatility cross-correlations persist across various fluctuations, while return series display persistence in small fluctuations and antipersistence in large fluctuations. These findings carry significant practical implications for hedging and risk diversification purposes.",2024-02-15,
The convenience yield under commodity financialization,"Abstract A number of papers have dealt with commodity financialization finding strong evidence for its existence and its effect on commodity prices and volatility. We chose convenience yield (CY) to study the effect of commodity financialization based on the theory of storage and on the argument that CY resembles a call option. Using quarterly data in the period 1995–2018, on soybeans stocks, cash and futures prices, a dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag with Exogenous model is estimated to measure the effects of independent variables from both the financial and commodity markets on CY. The evidence reveals that financial markets volatility along macroeconomic global variables affect soybeans CY giving support to the existence of commodity financialization. Besides, we find a statistically significant and negative relation between volatility index and CY. Support for this evidence rests on the theory of storage, Real Option Analysis, and behavioral finance.",2024-01-31,
Financial Market Stress and Commodity Returns: A Dynamic Approach,"This paper examines the relationship between commodity index returns and the Office of Financial Research Financial Stress Index (OFR FSI). Utilizing the S&amp;P GSCI and its five sub-indices (agriculture, livestock, energy, industrial metals, and precious metals), we find that the causal relationship between financial market stress and commodity index returns is conditional on the sample period examined and the methodology employed. We also note that stress in financial markets has a negative relationship with commodity index returns during low commodity return states; however, during high commodity return states, financial market stress exhibits a positive relationship with commodity index returns. Our findings highlight the importance of considering a time-varying framework for analyzing commodity return dynamics.",2024-01-24,
A Survey of Literature on the Interlinkage between Petroleum Prices and Equity Markets,"The multifaceted interrelationship between petroleum prices and equity markets has been a subject of immense interest. The current paper offers an extensive review of a plethora of empirical studies in this strand of literature. By scrutinising over 190 papers published from 1983 to 2023, our survey reveals various research themes and points to diverse findings that are sector- and country-specific and contingent on employed methodologies, data frequencies, and time horizons. More precisely, petroleum price changes and shocks exert direct or indirect effects dictated by the level of petroleum dependency across sectors and the country’s position as a net petroleum exporter or importer. The interlinkages tend to display a time-varying nature and sensitivity to major market events. In addition, volatility is not solely spilled from petroleum to equity markets; it is also observed to transmit in the reverse direction. The importance of incorporating asymmetries is documented. Lastly, the summarised findings can serve as the basis for further research and reveal valuable insights to market participants.",2024-01-22,
Analysis of Representative Stocks in the UK Supermarket Industry,"This essay provides a comprehensive analysis of three major supermarket stocks: Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S), Sainsbury's, and Tesco. The analysis focuses on evaluating the risks, profitability, market ratios, and suitability for different types of investors. M&amp;S exhibits the highest level of risk, while Tesco and Sainsbury's appear to be more stable. M&amp;S is the most profitable stock, followed by Tesco and Sainsbury's. In terms of market ratios, M&amp;S shows potential undervaluation and growth opportunities, Sainsbury's offers a high dividend yield, and both Sainsbury's and Tesco display positive momentum. The preferred stock choices for different types of investors are Sainsbury's for value investors, M&amp;S for growth investors, Tesco for index investors, and Sainsbury's for income investors. These results are used for different investors to analyze and decide which company they will invest to earn more profit in its operation.",2024-01-22,
The Tendency of Investing in Transportation Industry,"The background of this paper is that between 2023 and 2022, traffic is still an indispensable part of people's daily life and a necessary condition for the development of social order and economy. Vehicle manufacturers are an essential part of the transportation industry, and the new energy industry and the traditional energy industry compete with each other and jointly promote. This paper aims to study the investors attracted by big-name companies in the transportation industry by analyzing various indicators. This paper selects are three high-profile in the transportation sector, internationalization and very competitive in the market and the voice of the company, including Nio, Boeing and Ferrari. A total of 13 financial indicators are collected and compared among the three companies. After analyzing and comparing 13 kinds of financial indicators, this paper deduces that value investors, index investors and growth investors are likely to invest in Nio, index investors, momentum investors and DCF investors are likely to invest in Boeing, ratio investors and growth investors are likely to invest in Ferrari.",2024-01-22,
The impact of deviations from soybean product crushing estimates on return and risk,"Abstract This study explores how differences in market yields of soymeal and soyoil, as derived from market prices compared to those obtained through the physical process of crushing soybeans, impact the returns and volatilities of these commodities. Positive (negative) deviations are associated with negative (positive) changes in return. Additionally, these deviations positively correlate with return volatility, suggesting that variations from the expected yields lead to price shifts and heightened return volatility. In summary, deviations from the crushing estimates significantly shape the modeling of soybean commodity returns and volatilities, with implications for understanding returns, hedging ratios, and portfolio return variance.",2024-01-18,
How do supply or demand shocks affect the US oil market?,"Abstract The study of the relationship between crude oil and its refined products prices may be perceived as an important tool for testing how are the dynamics and the type of integration of the petro-derivatives market in the United States. In this sense, we have applied a set of causality tests to study the possible presence of asymmetries in the relationship between WTI crude oil and each refined product price and to explore the type of market integration. Furthermore, the application of these causality tests lets us explore the validation of different hypotheses in the literature, such as the Rocket and Feathers hypothesis and the Verleger hypothesis. Our findings reveal that Reformulated Gasoline Blendstock for Oxygen Blending (RBOB), heating oil, diesel and kerosene are supply-driven integrated and conventional gasoline and kerosene are demand-driven integrated when linear effects are assessed. This behaviour changes deeply when the existence of asymmetries is tested, noticing that the Rocket and Feathers hypothesis is not fulfilled when a negative shock appears. Conversely, the Verleger hypothesis is supported when a negative shock appears for conventional gasoline and kerosene. These results provide important policy implications for investors, energy policymakers and refiners.",2024-01-14,
"Russia–Ukraine Conflict, Commodities and Stock Market: A Quantile VAR Analysis","The Russia–Ukrainian war, which began in 2014 and exploded with the invasion of the Russian army on 24 February 2022, has profoundly destabilized the political, economic and financial balance of Europe and beyond. To the humanitarian emergency associated with every war has been added the deep crisis generated by the strong energy and food dependence that many European countries, and not only European, have developed over decades on Ukraine (especially for wheat) and Russia (especially for natural gas). The aim of this article is to verify the existence of a link between the performance of the Eurostoxx index and the price of wheat futures and TTF natural gas, from 25 February 2019 to 28 September 2023. Through a quantile VAR analysis, a link is sought between the Eurostoxx 50 index, and wheat and TTF gas futures prices. Furthermore, the analysis intends to understand whether the presence of such relationship only manifested itself following the war events, or whether it was already present in the market. The analysis carried out also shows that the relationship between the stock market and raw material prices was present even before the conflict.",2024-01-11,
Does the financialization of agricultural commodities impact food security? An empirical investigation,"The financialization of agricultural commodities and its impact on food security has become an increasing concern. This study empirically investigates the role of financialization in global food markets and its policy implications for a stable and secure food system. Using panel data regression models, moderating effects models, and panel regression with a threshold variable, we analyze wheat, maize, and soybean futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. We incorporate data on annual trading volume, open interest contracts, and their ratio. The sample consists of five developed countries (United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany) and seven developing countries (China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand), covering the period 2000 to 2021. The Human Development Index (HDI) serves as a threshold variable to differentiate the impact across countries. Our findings indicate that the financialization of agricultural commodities has negatively affected global food security, with wheat and soybean showing a greater adverse impact than maize. The effects are more pronounced in developing countries. Additionally, we find that monetary policy has the potential to mitigate these negative effects. These results provide insights for policymakers to design strategies that ensure a secure and accessible global food supply.",2024-01-04,
Dynamic asymmetric spillovers and connectedness between Chinese sectoral commodities and industry stock markets,"This study investigates the dynamic and asymmetric propagation of return spillovers between sectoral commodities and industry stock markets in China. Using a daily dataset from February 2007 to July 2022, we employ a time-varying vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model to examine the asymmetric return spillovers and dynamic connectedness across sectors. The results reveal significant time-varying spillovers among these sectors, with the industry stocks acting as the primary transmitter of information to the commodity market. Materials, energy, and industrials stock sectors contribute significantly to these spillovers due to their close ties to commodity production and processing. The study also identifies significant asymmetric spillovers with bad returns dominating, influenced by major economic and political events such as the 2008 global financial crisis, the 2015 Chinese stock market crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Furthermore, our study highlights the unique dynamics within the Chinese market, where net information spillovers from the stock market to commodities drive the financialization process, which differs from the bidirectional commodity financialization observed in other markets. Finally, portfolio analysis reveals that the minimum connectedness portfolio outperforms other approaches and effectively reflects asymmetries. Understanding these dynamics and sectoral heterogeneities has important implications for risk management, policy development, and trading practices.",2024-01-02,
Factor Momentum in Commodity Futures Markets,"This paper examines the factor momentum in commodity futures markets. Based on the US and UK data from 1985 to 2022, we first show that a commodity factor's past returns positively predict its future returns. This predictability leads to sizable economic profits in a long-short trading strategy, is at its strongest over the one-month horizon, and could be explained by mispricing. The factor momentum suggests mean-variance inefficient commodity factors and negatively impacts the efficiency of pricing models. We then construct the time-series efficient factors, which exhibit higher Sharpe ratios and improve the performance of pricing models. These findings are robust across international commodity futures markets. Our results point to the potential to time commodity factors and highlight the importance of conditional asset pricing in commodity futures markets.",2024-01-01,
Co-integration and Causal Relationship between Energy Commodities and Energy Stock Index: Empirical Evidence from India,"This article's primary objective is to evaluate, within the Indian setting, the degree to which energy commodities and energy stock prices correlate and are causally related. Weekly spot price data has been sourced from the Multi Commodity Exchange and the National Stock Exchange, which spans from January 2007 to December 2021. This study employs Auto-regressive Distributive (ARDL) Bound test along with Johansen co-integration approach to understand the co-integration between the series under study. The findings support the idea that the energy stock index listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the energy commodities traded on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) do not exhibit any co-integration. Furthermore, to investigate the cause-and-effect connection between the energy stock index and energy commodities, Granger Causality test has been utilised, which was introduced by Toda and Yamamoto. The results demonstrate that there is no causal relationship between MCX energy commodities and the NSE energy stock index. Thus, the nonexistence of cointegration and causality between NSE energy index and energy commodities provides portfolio diversification opportunities for the investors to hedge their risk by investing in both energy commodities and energy stock index. Policymakers need to promote deeper integration among these markets by making more regulatory and accounting changes.",2024-01-01,

"Tail Risk Contagion and Diversification Among Energy, Metal and Agriculture Commodities: A Network Perspective","This study investigates tail risk contagion and diversification effects in commodity markets with tail risk networks. Adjacency matrices reveal stronger contagion effects among commodities within the same category than those among different categories, while industrial metals play a crucial role in cross-category risk contagion. Besides, compared to the Russia-Ukraine war, the COVID-19 pandemic has a more disruptive impact on commodity markets. Moreover, the primary risk contributors in commodity markets are time-varying. Finally, we observe market heterogeneity and asymmetry in the impact of network factors on commodity markets. These findings hold significance for regulatory agencies to maintain stability in commodity markets.",2024-01-01,
Trade Friction and Evolution Process of Price Discovery in China's Agricultural Commodity Markets,"This paper is the first to examine the evolution of price discovery in agricultural commodity markets across the four distinct phases determined by trade friction and trade policy uncertainty. Using cointegrated vector autoregressive model and common factor weights, we report that corn, cotton, soybean meal, and sugar (palm oil, soybean, soybean oil, and wheat) futures (spot) play a dominant role in price discovery during the full sample period. Moreover, the leadership in price discovery evolves over time in conjunction with changes in trade friction phases. However, such results vary across commodities. We also report that most of the agricultural commodity markets are predominantly led by futures markets in price discovery during phase Ⅲ, except for the wheat market. Our results indicate that taking trade friction into consideration would benefit portfolio managements and diversifying agricultural trade partners holds significance.",2024-01-01,
Media Emotion Intensity and Commodity Futures Pricing,"This study investigates the impact of media emotion intensity on commodities futures returns. Emotion intensity measures the proportion of emotional content relative to factual content in media news. This new factor is distinct from news sentiment and media coverage and exhibits weak cross-sectional correlations with both of them. The media emotion intensity factor exhibits an annual premium of around 14.40% and is more pronounced for commodities with low media coverage, high momentum, high basis-momentum, high hedging pressure, and backwardation. Emotion intensity significantly predicts the trading tendencies of both commercial and non-commercial traders and the cross-section of commodity futures returns at both portfolio and individual levels. Further, other commonly considered risk sources cannot subsume the predictability of the media emotion intensity factor.",2024-01-01,

Charging Up on Lithium - the Metal or the Miner?,"This paper examines if investors can get full exposure to lithium prices through investments in lithium miners. Until the recent introduction of lithium futures, there was no direct way to invest in the lithium commodity itself. We find that the performance of a portfolio of lithium miners broadly follows that of lithium enabling investors to participate in the performance of lithium. However, the average return and the volatility are 50% and 66% higher respectively for the miner portfolio than for the commodity, reflecting the technical and firm-specific risks of lithium mining. Surprisingly, the lithium betas of lithium miners are relatively low for contemporaneous returns but higher for miner returns leading lithium returns as miner stocks are the only investible instrument for the commodity.",2024-01-01,

Real Effects of Carbon Financialization,"The recent influx of financial traders into carbon allowance markets has raised concerns about its distortive effects on carbon allowance prices and its repercussions for firms that rely on these price signals to make emissions decisions. This paper studies how financial carbon trading affects the allocative efficiency of carbon allowance markets and highlights the importance of facilitating financial arbitrages rather than imposing restrictions. Exploiting allowance transaction data in the European carbon market and using carbon policy shocks as supply shifters, I identify a price-inelastic carbon demand by large financial traders. The lack of elastic arbitrage capital is associated with a decline in the carbon price informativeness and contributes to the carbon market crash during the Russia-Ukraine war. The decreased informativeness has real effects: I find that firms with inferior private information reduce their emissions less efficiently when the carbon price is less informative, and the cross-sectional dispersion of carbon intensity increases with the informational inefficiency. I develop a macro-finance model with managerial learning from carbon prices that rationalizes these novel empirical findings.",2024-01-01,

"Financial contagion of commodity markets from energy markets during the pandemic, energy crisis and SMO","The financialization of commodity markets leads to their integration with global financial markets and increasing inclusion in chains of transmission of systemic risk in the economy. Financial contagion is an atypical increase in the interdependence of financial markets under the influence of external shocks. The subject of this study is the financial contagion of global commodity markets (soft and agricultural goods) from the global energy market (oil and gas) during the pandemic, energy crisis and special military operation of Russia in Ukraine (SMO). The purpose of the study is to establish the facts of financial contagion, its dynamics and intensity for different groups of goods. The construction of the author's stress indices allows us to distinguish between periods of a calm market and increased market volatility. Testing for contagion is carried out using the construction of ARDL-GARCH models, dynamic method of co-moments of the returns distribution of the source market of contagion and the recipient market, including the calculation of conditional correlation, coskewness, cokurtosis and covolatility. A conclusion about possible contagion is made based on a comparison of test statistics with a critical value for a normal or asymptotically normal distribution. The study confirmed contagion of exchange-traded futures markets by oil and natural gas futures markets in all periods. Oil market showed greater contagiousness compared to the gas market; oil proved to be relatively uniformly contagious in different periods, while gas proved to be relatively more contagious during the SMO. Agricultural commodities have proven to be more susceptible to contagion from energy markets than soft commodities. Stronger market contagion occurs at higher co-moments of distribution (volatility contagion, return-volatility and return-asymmetry contagion) than at lower co-moments of distribution. The results obtained can be useful for investors in developing optimal hedging strategies and managing investment portfolios, and for the state in improving financial stabilization policies during periods of crisis.",2024-01-01,
Will commodity futures reduce systemic risk in the spot market? Evidence from Chinese commodity market,"Purpose This paper aims to investigate whether the establishment of commodity futures can effectively hedge systemic risk in the spot network, given the context of financialization in the commodity futures market. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing industry association data from the Chinese commodity market, the authors identify systemically important commodities based on their importance in the production process using multiple graph analysis methods. Then the authors analyze the effect of listing futures on the systemic risk in the spot market with the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method. Findings The findings suggest that futures contracts help reduce systemic risks in the underlying spot network. Systemic risk for a commodity will decrease by approximately 5.7% with the introduction of each corresponding futures contract, since the hedging function of futures reduces the timing behavior of firms in the spot market. Establishing futures contracts for upstream commodities lowers systemic risks for downstream commodities. Energy commodities, such as crude oil and coal, have higher systemic importance, with the energy sector dominating systemic importance, while some chemical commodities also have considerable systemic importance. Meanwhile, the shortest transmission path for risk propagation is composed of the energy industry, chemical industry, agriculture/metal industry and final products. Originality/value The paper provides the following policy insights: (1) The role of futures contracts is still positive, and future contracts should be established upstream and at more systemically important nodes in the spot production chain. (2) More attention should be paid to the chemical industry chain, as some chemical commodities are systemically important but do not have corresponding futures contracts. (3) The risk source of the commodity spot market network is the energy industry, and therefore, energy-related commodities should continue to be closely monitored.",2023-11-30,
"Financialization: A bibliometric review, research streams, influential works, and future research paths","Bibliometric analysis is one of the most prominent methods for conducting a quantitative assessment of publications. Thus, this study focuses on conducting a bibliometric analysis of the structural research development of financialization. By collecting relevant data from the Scopus database and subsequently graphing the results on VOSviewer, we were able to draw conclusive findings on financialization research development. Research on financialization is considered vital, as no study has analyzed research articles on this topic in the past 25 years, even though it is an emerging topic that is expected to have a great impact on the future of finance. Hence, this report presents the detailed and meticulous process of this analysis while highlighting suggestions for future research.",2023-11-27,
Predictability of commodity futures returns with machine learning models,"Abstract We use prevailing machine learning models to investigate the predictability of futures returns in 22 commodities with commodity‐specific and macroeconomic factors as predictors. Out‐of‐sample prediction errors for the majority of futures contracts are lowered compared with those obtained by the baseline models of AR(1) and forecast combinations. Using Shapley values to explain feature importance, we identify dominant predictors for each commodity. A long–short portfolio strategy based on monthly light gradient‐boosting machine predictions outperforms the benchmark linear models in terms of annual return, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown.",2023-11-08,
New evidence on crude oil market efficiency,"Abstract This paper examines the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) in crude oil amid the “financialization of commodity markets” and the “fracking revolution”. It applies the generalized spectral derivative test (Hong and Lee 2005) on both West Texas Intermediate and Brent spot and futures markets, alongside a stochastic dominance test (Linton et al., 2005) to investigate arbitrage opportunities across markets and benchmarks. The findings indicate that financialization has made each market more efficient but also created more arbitrage opportunities in spot‐futures markets at both benchmarks. The fracking revolution has fragmented oil markets but had little impact on EMH in individual markets or across markets.",2023-11-05,
When passive funds affect prices: evidence from volatility and commodity ETFs,"Abstract This article studies exchange-traded funds’ (ETFs) price impact in the most ETF-dominated asset classes: volatility (VIX) and commodities. I propose a new way to measure ETF-related price distortions based on the specifics of futures contracts. This allows me to isolate a component in VIX futures prices that is strongly related to the rebalancing of ETFs. I derive a novel decomposition of ETF trading demand into leverage rebalancing, calendar rebalancing, and flow rebalancing, and show that trading against ETFs is risky. Leverage rebalancing has the largest effects on the ETF-related price component. This rebalancing amplifies price changes and exposes ETF counterparties to variance.",2023-11-01,
World uncertainty and commodity currencies,"This paper contributes to the literature by analysing shock propagation mechanisms between world uncertainty, exchange rates and country-specific commodity terms of trade. Using monthly data from 2008 to 2020 for eight commodity currencies' exchange rates, we analyse the impulse responses based on local projections. The study results show that a shock from the exchange rates which are net transmitters of shocks through the direct United States (US) dollar effect causes world uncertainty to rise and subsequently fall due to the indirect commodity terms of trade effect. Also, in response to world uncertainty shock, the exchange rates fall in the risk-on period and subsequently overshoot during the risk-off period when investors seek the safe haven of the dollar. The world uncertainty shock on the exchange rate is predominantly experienced in the economies that largely trade commodities with the US, particularly Russia and Canada. The study finds evidence that the dollar is a prime cause of world uncertainty. Hence, for policy implications, the study discusses that policymakers, investors, or traders pay attention to the dollar which is the main invoicing currency in the international market.",2023-10-30,
"Comparison of the Asymmetric Relationship between Bitcoin and Gold, Crude Oil, and the U.S. Dollar before and after the COVID-19 Outbreak","This paper aims to reveal the asymmetric co-integration relationship and asymmetric causality between Bitcoin and global financial assets, namely gold, crude oil and the US dollar, and make a comparison for their asymmetric relationship before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Empirical results show that there is no linear co-integration relationship between Bitcoin and global financial assets, but there are nonlinear co-integration relationships. There is an asymmetric co-integration relationship between the rise in Bitcoin prices and the decline in the US Dollar Index (USDX), and there is a nonlinear co-integration relationship between the decline of Bitcoin and the rise and decline in the prices of the three financial assets. To be specific, there is a Granger causality between Bitcoin and crude oil, but not between Bitcoin and gold/US dollar. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an Asymmetric Granger causality between the decline in gold prices and the rise in Bitcoin prices. After the outbreak of the pandemic, there is an asymmetric Granger causality between the decline in crude oil prices and the decline in Bitcoin prices. The COVID-19 epidemic has led to changes in the causality between Bitcoin and global financial assets. However, there is not a linear Granger causality between the US dollar and Bitcoin. Last, the practical implications of the findings are discussed here.",2023-10-20,
Does commodity exposure benefit traditional portfolios? Evidence from India,"Commodities and commodity futures are expected to benefit stock and bond portfolio diversification because traditional asset types like equities and bonds have low correlations with commodities. During periods when stocks and bonds may underperform, commodities may provide a hedge against inflation and other economic uncertainties. This study investigates the diversification benefits of adding commodities to a traditional portfolio of stock and bonds from the perspective of an Indian investor. It employs several commonly used asset allocation strategies such as mean-variance, equal risk contribution, most diversified portfolio, and equal weight portfolio on different commodity derivative groups. The performance of various portfolios indicates that not all commodity groups provide substantial diversification benefits to a traditional portfolio. Agricultural commodities enhance performance (with an Omega ratio of 1.654), whereas metal and energy-related commodities do not diversify the traditional portfolio significantly (Omega ratio of 1.087 and 0.945, respectively). Gold and different equity sectors also provide some diversification benefits. This study also supports the hypothesis that the behavior of different commodity groups is quite different.

Asymmetric effects of market uncertainties on agricultural commodities,"The interplay between energy and agricultural commodities and responses of agricultural commodities to global uncertainty factors have been receiving increasing attention due to the pivotal contributions of commodity markets to the world economy. This study investigates the asymmetric effects of oil, market volatility and sentiment, economic policy uncertainty, and geopolitical risk on agricultural commodities in a nonparametric quantile-on-quantile regression framework. The sample used for empirical analysis spans from January 03, 2013, to October 21, 2022 and includes ten agricultural commodities (canola, cocoa, coffee, corn, feeder cattle, lean hogs, live cattle, orange juice, sugar, and wheat), crude oil, crude oil implied volatility (OVX), market sentiment (VIX), economic policy uncertainty of the US (USEPU), and geopolitical risk (GPR). The empirical findings suggest that crude oil fails to serve as either a hedge or safe-haven for agricultural commodities. Meanwhile, OVX and VIX serve as potential hedges against agricultural commodity shocks. At elevated levels of USEPU, agricultural commodities reveal only weak hedging capacities against the USEPU-driven downside risks and mostly act just as diversifiers of economic policy uncertainty effects. However, they could hedge against the crystallisations of the downside geopolitical risks. These findings are important for effective regulation policies, risk management, and portfolio decisions across bullish, bearish, and normal market conditions.",2023-10-04,
Determinants of commodity market liquidity,"Abstract Using positions data for 18 commodity futures during 2001–2020, we examine systematic and idiosyncratic determinants of Amihud price impact and microstructure noise proxying for permanent and transitory components of commodity futures liquidity. Idiosyncratic factors have the largest economic impact: while excess hedging demand increases PI and noise, active position‐taking (by market‐makers) in excess of the hedging demand reduces noise. Systematic factors, including the lack of competition among liquidity providers, adversely impact liquidity, but this effect is mitigated if liquidity providers are well‐capitalized. Supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) makes holding inventory costlier and is associated with lower liquidity.",2023-09-30,
Revisiting WTI–Brent spread and its drivers,"We made two key contributions to energy economics and finance by revealing new insights on the WTI–Brent spread (WBS). Our first exercise engages with the stylized facts of the WBS and its role as an indicator, identifying the time around the shale oil revolution as a turning point in the mean- and persistence-based shifts in the spread's time-series properties. The second exercise delves into the fundamental connection between the WBS and key US-based and international market factors. We utilized three sets of explanatory factors, representing demand, supply, and uncertainties. The data for this study were sourced primarily from Refinitiv Eikon and EIA, spanning from 1988 to 2020. The results affirmed demand-side variables to have predictive power for widening spreads, whereas supply-side factors, such as oil rig counts, trans-US pipeline flow, and import from Canada, contributed to spread shrinkage. This finding specifically held in robustness check using quantile-based regression. Supplementary causality tests revealed that economic conditions contain greater causal influence than market-based indicators, suggesting that the spread traders respond more to fundamental drivers than financial sentiments.",2023-09-28,
The evolution of commodity market financialization: Implications for portfolio diversification,"The financialization of commodity markets is a well-documented phenomenon spurred by the massive growth of institutional funds directed into commodity indices from the mid-2000s. More recent research suggests that a subsequent era of de-financialization has coincided with the retreat of institutional investors. This paper uses a latent factor model to examine the dynamic impact of commodity market financialization on spot currency, commodity and equity market linkages, focusing on countries with 'commodity currencies'. The financialization period is characterized by increased interdependence of non-oil and oil commodity markets with each other and with other asset markets, implying reduced diversification potential. We find that commodity markets have become more highly interconnected with currency and equity markets of the large commodity exporters over the most recent sub-sample. We suggest that apparent de-financialization may be attributable to contagion effects from global crisis events, including the Great Recession and the European Debt Crisis of 2012.",2023-09-21,
Revisiting the Causality between Oil Prices and Stock Markets in Selected MENA Countries: A Bootstrap Rolling-window Approach,"The main objective of this paper is to explore the dynamic causality between the fluctuations in oil prices and the trends observed in stock market indices of selected economies with oil-related characteristics. These countries include oil-importing nations such as Egypt and Tunisia, as well as one oil-exporting country, namely Oman. Our study uses monthly data spanning from January 2008 to February 2022. To investigate this causality, we adopt the rolling-window bootstrap causality test. The empirical results reveal that the causal relationship between stock market indices and oil prices is not stable, but rather fluctuates over time. Remarkably, these variations in causality coincide to important events, such as the sovereign debt crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. This suggests that external shocks and exceptional events significantly influence the causal dynamics between oil prices and stock market in these countries. It is, therefore, crucial for policymakers and investors to take into account periods of economic uncertainty and major world events into their decision-making process. By adopting a proactive approach and carefully monitoring global economic indicators, they will be able to anticipate risks, adjust their strategies to meet economic challenges.",2023-09-13,
Do Futures Prices Help Forecast Spot Prices? Evidence from China’s New Live Hog Futures,"China, the largest hog producer and consumer globally, has long experienced significant fluctuations in hog prices, partly due to the lack of rational expectations for future hog spot prices. However, on 8 January 2021, China’s first futures in animal husbandry, the live hog futures, were listed on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. To investigate the forecasting performance of the new live hog futures on forthcoming hog spot prices, we developed six futures-based forecasting models and utilized data on daily hog spot and futures prices from January 2021 to March 2023. Our results show that all six models consistently generate more accurate forecasts than the no-change model across six prediction horizons and four accuracy measures, indicating that China’s new live hog futures prices help forecast forthcoming hog spot prices. Among the futures-based forecasting models, futures spread-based models generally produce the best forecasts for one-, two-, three-, and four-month-ahead forecasting, while the simple linear regression using both spot and futures prices is the best for five- and six-month-ahead forecasting. Our results suggest that live hog futures are a promising and practical tool for various stakeholders in China’s hog industry to develop rational expectations for future hog spot prices.",2023-08-23,
"On the transmission mechanism between the inventory arbitrage activity, speculative activity and the commodity price under the US QE policy: Evidence from a TVP-VAR model","We investigate the transmission that relates the speculative activity, the inventory arbitrage activity, and the commodity price under the US quantitative easing (QE) policy. In this direction, a TVP-VAR model is adopted to test the transmission effect on seven commodities' prices using monthly data over the period 2003:4 to 2018:6. The evidence supports Frankel's (2006) model on the transmission mechanism of the inventory arbitrage activity and the speculative activity on the effect of the real interest rate on commodities' real prices in the short run during the US QE policy period. Moreover, speculative activity appears to increase the effect of the interest rate on commodities' prices in the current period, whilst the evidence between inventory arbitrage activity and the interest rate on commodities' prices is found to be mixed. Further analysis indicates that the transmission of arbitrage activities concerning the effect of the interest rate on commodities' prices is influenced by the arbitrage condition between the commodity and the interest rate markets as well as the changes in commodities' futures basis. More specifically, the inventory arbitrage activities of precious metals and energy commodities play a significant role in transmitting the effect of the interest rate on their prices whilst energy commodities' price is more flexible than other commodities' prices in response to a shock from both inventory arbitrage and speculative activities. Lastly, the influence of the interest rate, the inventory arbitrage activity and the speculative activity is found to be stronger during the de-financialization period.",2023-08-16,
Przenoszenie zmienności cen pomiędzy rynkami towarów rolnych i energetycznych – perspektywa rynków europejskich w czasie pandemii COVID-19 i wojny rosyjsko-ukraińskiej,"Celem pracy była ocena powiązań w zakresie zmienności cen pomiędzy pięcioma rynkami terminowymi z giełd Euronext i ICE: pszenicy, kukurydzy, rzepaku, ropy Brent i gazu ziemnego w okresie styczeń 2017–styczeń 2023, a w szczególności wskazanie rynków będących dominującym źródłem zmienności wśród rozpatrywanych. Do przeprowadzenia tej oceny zastosowano indeks przenoszenia zmienności Diebolda-Yilmaza bazujący na uogólnionej dekompozycji wariancji błędu prognozy oraz jego rozszerze nie w dziedzinie częstotliwości Baruníka-Křehlíka. Okres od wybuchu pandemii COVID-19 do początku 2023 r. wiąże się ze wzrostem zmienności cen na rynkach żywności i energii. W czasie pandemii COVID-19 efekt przenoszenia zmienności pomiędzy rynkami był dwukrotnie silniejszy niż w latach 2017–2019, a podczas wojny rosyjsko-ukraińskiej trzykrotnie. Główne źródło szoków rynkowych w okresie rozprzestrzeniania się wirusa SARS-CoV-2 stanowił rynek rzepaku, podczas gdy w czasie działań wojennych w Ukrainie rolę tę przejął rynek pszenicy. Zmienność nie była przenoszona natychmiastowo, dając tym samym szansę na wdrożenie procedur zarządzania ryzykiem, które łagodziłyby wpływ szoków pochodzących z jednego rynku na pozostałe.",2023-08-04,
Which Commodity Sectors Effectively Hedge Emerging Eastern European Stock Markets? Evidence from MGARCH Models,"This study aims at examining whether hedging emerging Eastern Europe stock markets with commodities sectors can help in reducing market risks and whether it has the same effectiveness among different sectors. As an attempt to achieve this goal, we opt for three types of MGARCH model. These are DCC, ADCC and GO-GARCH, which are used with each bivariate series to model dynamic conditional correlations, optimal hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness. Rolling window analysis is used for out-of-sample one-step-ahead forecasts from December 1994 to June 2022. The results have shown that the commodities sectors of industrial metals and energy represent the optimal hedging instruments for emerging Eastern Europe stock markets as they have the highest hedging effectiveness. Additionally, our empirical results have proved that hedge ratios estimated by the DCC and ADCC models are very similar, which is not the case for GO-GARCH, and that hedging effectiveness is preferably estimated by the ADCC model.",2023-08-03,
Investing in Carbon Credits,"Compliance carbon allowances are an important tool to reduce carbon emissions and align production and consumption with the Paris Agreement. The four sizable compliance carbon allowance markets accessible to investors are those of the European Union, the United Kingdom, California, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the United States. The authors document the liquidity of futures traded on the carbon allowances of these four markets. Return correlation between markets is limited, leading to diversification benefits for global carbon investors. Global carbon market returns also provide diversification opportunities for investors in conventional asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.",2023-08-01,
"The three co’s to jointly model commodity markets: co-production, co-consumption and co-trading","Abstract In this study, we develop a framework, based on a global vector autoregression (GVAR) model, to unite two perspectives on commodity markets, the commodity-specific, single-market-centered approach, investigating the micro- and macroeconomic drivers of commodity prices, and the market perspective, which observes joint movements of commodity prices on exchanges. Thereby, the GVAR model disentangles single market from inter-market effects, while simultaneously accounting for the impact of macroeconomic factors. We apply the framework to the six industrial metals markets, reflecting their interdependencies via their co-production, co-consumption, or co-trading relation. In particular, the numerous significant spillover effects in the cross-commodity dimension underline the importance of jointly modeling commodity markets. While the strong co-movement between industrial metal prices is represented exceptionally well by our framework, the microeconomic supply and demand attributes of the commodities have significant impact, within and across markets, even on price variables, highlighting their relevance in modern commodity market models. Moreover, we detect global shocks, e.g., an increase in global demand, affect each commodity market to a similar extent.",2023-07-25,
"Commodity market financialization, herding and signals: An asymmetric GARCH R-vine copula approach","Institutional investors have significantly increased their exposure to commodity futures after 2004 in the process of commodity market financialization, raising questions about the risk-sharing and price-discovery functions of the market. We identify some symptoms of financialization through examining S&P500, JPM bond index, and 18 S&P GSCI excess return indices, employing ARMA-GARCH R-vine copula approach that can flexibly model high-dimensional multivariate asymmetric tail dependence. We discover three trends: an increased resemblance between the news impact curve of stocks and those of commodities; an increased bi-variate stock-commodity tail dependence; and an increased multivariate tail-dependence across all commodities. We also explore the market structural change underlying these symptoms using an augmented news impact curve. We suggest and provide evidence that herding, in addiction to leverage effect, explains the observed symptoms. The findings have profound implications for commercial hedgers and financial traders, and for regulators who are concerned about the functionalities of commodity futures market.",2023-07-12,
"Dynamics of a Newly Established Agricultural Commodities Market: Financialization, Hedging and Portfolio Diversification in Turkey","The purpose of this study is to investigate the dynamic relationship between financial assets and agricultural commodities market in Turkey. For this purpose, first, this study investigates financialization of agricultural commodities with a newly established agricultural commodities market of Turkey. Second, this paper analyzes hedging and portfolio diversification performances of agricultural commodities. By employing the DCC-GARCH approach of Engle (2002) and spillover index approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2014), we analyze the financialization of agricultural commodities and calculate optimal hedge ratios and portfolio weights between two classes of assets. The results show the financialization of agricultural commodities at a very early age in Turkey. There exists a low degree of comovements and volatility spillovers between financial assets and agricultural commodities. Second, we show that agricultural commodities do not hedge financial investments sufficiently but they perform very well in terms of diversification and boost portfolio performances. Considering the previous limited literature on the topic, this study contributes to the literature by displaying the dynamics of a newly established agricultural commodities market in an emerging market. The findings of this study have many important implications for farmers and producers of agricultural commodities, and financial market actors such as individual investors, hedge funds and investment banks in terms of risk management and hedging.",2023-06-27,
ETP tracking of U.S. agricultural and energy markets,"This study assesses the tracking performance of several futures-backed commodity exchange-traded funds (ETFs), single commodity exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and commodity sector ETNs relevant to agricultural market participants. We decompose total tracking errors into managerial and arbitrage components. Our findings reveal that the arbitrage process is the primary driver of observed tracking errors. ETNs tend to exhibit much larger tracking errors than ETFs. The tracking performance was not substantially different across agricultural and energy ETFs nor across single commodity and commodity sector ETNs. Using a GARCH model, the study reveals greater persistence of tracking errors for ETNs than ETFs. Roll dates do not significantly affect the volatility of tracking errors. On the other hand, trading volume, lagged ETF price volatility, and broad market volatility may result in poorer ETF tracking performance.",2023-06-17,
The impact of oil price shocks on the U.S. and Chinese stock markets: A quantitative structural analysis,"This paper applies sign restrictions to identify oil structural shocks by imposing nonzero restrictions on the short-term price elasticity of oil supply. With the help of oil inventory data, flow supply, flow demand and speculative demand shocks in the global oil market are identified. Then, the impact of different kinds of oil price shocks on fluctuations of the U.S. and Chinese stock markets is examined and some insights from the perspective of frequency domain are provided. We observe that the U.S. and Chinese stock markets are extensively influenced by the three types of oil structural shocks. In particular, oil price shocks induced by speculation can significantly affect the performance of stock markets in both countries. Under the frequency domain, we notice that the flow demand shock is the most important driver of the variance in U.S. and Chinese stock returns and volatility, particularly at low and business cycle frequencies. Meanwhile, we note that short-term fluctuations in Chinese stock market returns and volatility are more vulnerable to speculative demand shocks. These analysis results are not only useful for policymakers to take targeted measures to deal with the impact of oil price shocks on the stock market, but also useful for investors to adjust their stock portfolios to achieve excess returns.",2023-06-16,
Betting on black gold: Oil speculation and U.S. inflation (2020-2022),"Sharp increases in systemically important crude oil prices have been a major cause of the recent surge in the inflation rate in the U.S. This paper investigates the extent to which the increase in oil prices can be attributed to excessive speculation in the oil futures market. Our analysis suggests that excessive speculation in the crude oil market has been responsible for 24%-48% of the increase in the WTI crude oil price during October 2020-June 2022. These estimates translate into an oil price increase of around $18-$36 per barrel and an increase in the U.S. PCE inflation rate by circa 0.75 to 1.5 percentage points during the same period. We complement the analysis with an empirical investigation of the crude oil market which shows that (speculative) long non-commercial open-interest positions in oil futures have increased considerably relative to short non-commercial positions. We further find that higher futures prices for crude oil ‘Granger-cause’ oil spot prices, the futures prices of corn and soybeans and the fertilizer price. These econometric results show that oil speculators have to be held accountable for not just raising oil prices, but also driving up food commodity prices. We finally discuss measures to clamp down on excessive speculation in oil in order to eliminate its systemically adverse consequences for the U.S. economy.",2023-06-06,
Financialization and speculators risk premia in commodity futures markets,"J.M. Keynes coined the term normal backwardation, a situation where a futures price for a particular expiry month is less than the expected spot price for that month. He argued hedgers pay speculators a risk premium, giving rise to normal backwardation. We study the behavior of commodity futures before and since financialization of the markets, which started about 20 years ago. We find the poor returns to managed futures in recent years are likely due to the impact of financialization and the associated outside money suppressing the futures risk premium.",2023-05-29,
Financialization and Commodity Markets Serial Dependence,"Recent financialization in commodity markets makes it easier for institutional investors to trade a portfolio of commodities via various commodity-indexed products. We present several pieces of novel causal evidence that daily exposure to such index trading results in price overshoots and reversals, as reflected in negative daily return autocorrelations, only among commodities in that index. This is because index trading propagates nonfundamental noise to all indexed commodities. We present direct evidence for such noise propagation using commodity news sentiment data.

Day-of-the-week effect: Petroleum and petroleum products,"This study tests for calendar anomalies in returns for petroleum and petroleum products via the futures market, specifically, the day-of-the-week (DOW) effect. The energy future contracts in this study are the WTI (West Texas Intermediate), Brent, RBOB (Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending) Gasoline, Heating Oil, and Natural Gas. Futures provide a more liquid insight into price movements relative to spot prices, where financial market participants can engage. We ensure the most appropriate price is used by focusing on the most liquid contracts by combining the front two months of the studied commodities nearing expiration. Our research shows that the DOW effect varies across the respective energy commodities; however, for investors engaged in trading these futures, our results may help time their trade decisions.",2023-05-17,
Never a Dull Moment: Entropy Risk in Commodity Markets,"Abstract We develop a new approach to determine investors’ risk compensations for all distributional moments of a security. Using the concept of entropy, which is a summary of all moments of a risky security, we derive the relationship between expected returns and their compensation for entropy risk. Entropy risk premium (ERP), which is entropy under the physical minus the risk-neutral measure, indicates the hedging cost against changes in risks associated with all moments of the return’s distribution. Applying our model to the commodity markets, we find that ERP carries economically significant information for the cross-section of returns that is different from individual or combined moments. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",2023-05-04,
Idiosyncratic volatility in commodity futures markets: measurement and puzzle,"Purpose This paper aims to propose an alternative method to measure idiosyncratic volatility and test whether the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle holds in commodity futures markets. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a partially new measure of idiosyncratic volatility in commodity futures markets based on the Schwartz and Smith (2000) short-term/long-term model. This model enables us to capture systematic risks of commodity futures markets in a parsimonious way. Findings Using a sample of futures contracts for 20 commodities from 1973 to 2022, this paper demonstrates that idiosyncratic volatility is more significant than systematic volatility in commodity futures markets, and that the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle does not hold in these markets. This paper also performs robustness tests to investigate whether the puzzle holds during subsample periods when commodity markets are more volatile and find consistent results. This study highlights the differences between commodity futures markets and equity markets and emphasizes the importance of investigating idiosyncratic volatility in commodity futures markets. Originality/value The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, this paper contributes to the literature by focusing on the idiosyncratic volatility of commodity futures returns. Second, this paper constructs a partially new measure of idiosyncratic volatility in commodity futures markets. Finally, this paper also contributes to the literature on the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle and demonstrates that the puzzle may not exist in commodity futures markets.",2023-04-25,
The predictive power of commodity prices for future economic growth: Evaluating the role of economic development,"Abstract This paper investigates the extent to which commodity prices can predict economic growth, the growth exposure of the countries to specific commodity group, and whether the country stage of development matters for growth dependency on commodities. We use a novel time‐varying mixed‐frequency vector autoregressive model to jointly estimate causality between monthly commodity prices and quarterly economic growth for the period from January 1980 to March 2020. Our findings suggest that growth dependency on commodities varies over time and across different synthetic measures, but in general solid evidence of predictability is determined. The overall commodity index shows better performance in predicting economic growth than the segregated proxies of either fuel or non‐fuel commodities in developed economies. However, the overall commodity index is as effective as the fuel index in predicting economic growth for their developing counterparts. We develop a new index of global commodity growth connectivity (GCGCI) to determine the economic growth dependency on commodities over time. Our results show that economic growth dependency on commodities has increased at least three times with financialization of commodity markets. The GCGCI for all commodities reveals a higher growth dependency on commodities in developing countries than developed ones in the post‐financialization period. Interestingly, we find that growth decreases its reliance on fuel commodities in both developed and developing countries after financialization of commodity markets. Our findings bear implications for policymakers to design stabilization policies in an attempt to protect economies vulnerable to commodity price shocks and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth.",2023-04-24,
"Commodity Price Cycles: Commonalities, Heterogeneities, and Drivers","This paper studies commodity price cycles and their underlying drivers using a dynamic factor model. The study employs a sample of 39 monthly commodity prices over 1970:01 to 2019:12. The analysis identifies global and group–specific cycles in commodity markets and includes them in a structural vector autoregressive model together with measures of global economic activity and global inflation, to disentangle their response to global demand, global supply, and commodity market-specific shocks. The findings reveal the following main results. (i) There exists a global cycle in commodity markets that accounts for an increasing fraction of co-movement in commodity prices over the past two decades, particularly for energy, metals, and precious metals. (ii) The results are heterogeneous across groups of commodities, with group-specific commodity cycles existing for grains and precious metals over the full sample period, 1970–2019. Metal and energy prices exhibit within-group synchronization over 1970–99; however, in recent years, their movements have become increasingly aligned with the global business cycle. (iii) Since 2000, the global commodity cycle is largely driven by global supply shocks, such as rapid productivity growth in emerging markets and developing economies, which increase demand for commodities. (iv) The large price spikes observed during the two most prominent commodity market boom-bust episodes of the past half-century (1972–74 and 2006–08) are driven additionally by shocks that are orthogonal to global economic activity such as shifts in speculative demand for commodities.",2023-04-11,
Seemingly Unrelated Regression Estimation for VAR Models with Explosive Roots*,"Abstract For VAR models with common explosive root, the OLS estimator of the autoregressive coefficient matrix is inconsistent (refer to Nielsen, 2009 and Phillips and Magdalinos, 2013). Although Phillips &amp; Magdalinos (2013) proposed using the future observations as the instrumental variable for removing the endogeneity from VAR models, type I error occurs when testing for a common explosive root from the distinct explosive roots before the implementation of IV estimation. Such error creates bias and variance in the estimate and further causes incorrect inference in the structural analysis such as forecast error decomposition (FEVD). Hence, we propose using of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimation for VAR models with explosive roots. Our SUR estimator is consistent in the case of both distinct explosive roots and common explosive root. We also consider models with drift in the system for generalization. Simulations show that the SUR estimate performs better than OLS and IV estimate in the case of both a common explosive root and distinct explosive roots case. In structural FEVD analysis, simulations show that SUR yields a different result from OLS and IV. We demonstrate the use of SUR in FEVD for agricultural commodity markets between 3 July 2010, and 29 January 2011.",2023-04-11,
"Environmental, Social, and Governance Considerations in WTI Financialization through Energy Funds","This study investigates interactions between energy funds and the oil market and examines the influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in dynamic responses by fund managers and investors. We test for price and volatility transmission (also referred to as “spillover”) between energy funds and the oil market using recently developed econometric techniques. After identifying specific information flows, we investigate whether certain fund characteristics, including several ESG dimensions, are associated with the existence of information transmissions. Then, in logit regressions, we seek to identify if energy fund managers and their investors make decisions using information regarding ESG metrics, including fossil fuel involvement. The results confirm bidirectional price and volatility transmission between energy funds and the oil market, consistent with evidence of the financialization of energy markets that has been identified in recent studies. Several ESG dimensions are shown to influence investor sentiment and affect price and volatility interactions. Dynamic investor decisions in funds in reaction to oil prices do not appear to be strongly influenced by the fossil fuel involvement of the funds. Fund flows do appear to influence the oil market, with fund fossil fuel involvement being an important factor. This paper evaluates the impact of granular ESG characteristics on energy mutual fund flows, price, and volatility interactions with the oil market. While our results support the findings from previous studies, they also provide several new insights into the impacts of ESG criteria and investor behavior, particularly the dynamic response by fund managers and energy market investors related to the fossil fuel involvement of the funds.",2023-04-06,
Risk contagion in financial markets: A systematic review using bibliometric methods,"Abstract We explore evolving research trends and hotspots in financial contagion through keywords co‐occurrence and co‐citation network analyses. 2,071 articles have been collected from Web of Science Core Collection database from 2005 to 2021 and been analyzed by using bibliometric methods. The results indicate a tremendous growth in research on financial contagion, especially following the Global Finance Crisis. The current research mainly focuses on understanding the causes and consequences of past financial crises and recessions, examining the network effects of banks and other important financial institutions on risk contagion, developing new systematic approaches to modelling financial contagion, and providing empirical evidences for financial contagion among various asset classes and across different countries and regions. We find that there is still no consensus regarding the causes and measures of financial contagion, however, new promising perspectives have emerged to expand research in this area. We also propose several future directions for studies on financial contagion based on the research gap identified in this review.",2023-04-05,
Evaluating robust determinants of the WTI/Brent oil price differential: A dynamic model averaging analysis,"Abstract We investigate the robust determinants of the West Texas Intermediate/Brent oil price differential by employing a time‐varying framework. To achieve this, a dynamic model averaging framework is used, considering monthly data over the period 1994:1–2021:3. Our results suggest that the convenience yield, the global economic activity index, and the government bond yields act as the main factors that exercise a persistent and significant impact, for the largest part of the study period, although at different magnitude. More importantly, though, we show that at different time periods there are additional factors that exercise a significant impact on the oil price differential, such as refining constraints, stock market volatility, trading volume, and geopolitical risk. Thus, unless a dynamic modeling framework is employed, the full spectrum of the related effects cannot be revealed. A series of tests confirm the robustness of our findings. Several policy implications of these results are also discussed.",2023-04-05,
Time-Varying Relation between Oil Shocks and European Stock Market Returns,"This paper considers a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model to analyze the varying impact of three types of structural oil shocks (the supply-side shock, the aggregate demand shock, and the oil-specific demand shock) on the European stock market since the 1990s. Our findings show that the three types of oil shocks heterogeneously influence stock market returns in the euro area, and that this influence considerably changes over time during the period considered. First, an unexpected increase in oil supply appears to exert a positive but generally declining effect in the period before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–2009, which descends into negative values after the GFC. Second, an unanticipated increase in aggregate demand triggers a generally positive effect on stock market returns in the euro area. However, in the period from 2003 to 2005, stock market returns responded negatively, which could be attributed to the so-called growth-retarding effect. Third, an unexpected increase in oil-specific demand instigates a negative response in the pre-GFC period (considering the response 4–5 months after the shock), although this changes to a positive effect thereafter. Interestingly, irrespective of the origin of oil price fluctuations, oil price increases are associated with positive European stock market returns after the GFC. This signals a greater degree of oil market financialization.",2023-03-05,
Dynamic Relationship between Volatility Risk Premia of Stock and Oil Returns,"This study investigates the relationship between the volatility risk premia (VRP) of stock and oil returns. Using daily data on VRP from 10 May 2007 to 16 May 2017, VAR analyses on the stock and oil VRP are conducted, and it is found that the effects of the stock VRP on the oil VRP are limited and, if any, short-lived. In contrast, the VRP of oil has significantly positive and long-lasting effects on the stock VRP after the financial crisis. These results suggest that investors’ sentiments (measured by VRP) are transmitted from the oil to the stock market over time, but not vice versa. This is unexpected because the financialization of commodities means a massive increase in investment in commodities by investors in the traditional stock and bond markets; hence, the direction of effects is thought to be from the stock to the commodity market.",2023-03-05,
Gestión macrofiscal de la financiarización de commodities. Medición del Valor a Riesgo (VaR) de la canasta exportadora agrícola argentina,"El incremento en la volatilidad de precios de commodities ante el ingreso de inversores financieros, en el marco de la llamada financiarización, complejiza la gestión macroeconómica de países con alta incidencia de productos primarios en su comercio internacional. Este artículo tiene por objetivo proveer una medición de la exposición al riesgo de precio de las exportaciones para el caso argentino durante el período 1993-2018. Se emplea de forma novedosa el Valor a Riesgo (VaR), típicamente utilizado en finanzas, en el diseño de un portafolio de exportación de commodities que operan diariamente en los mercados internacionales. Entre los resultados principales se encuentra que el 2.90 % del total exportado está expuesto a riesgo de precio mensual durante el período 2004-2018, en comparación con el 1.73 % registrado entre 1993 y el 2003. Este indicador aporta al diseño de reglas fiscales que permitan planificar los gastos en función de ingresos estructurales en contextos de alta volatilidad.",2023-03-03,
Cointegration between high base metals prices and backwardation: Getting ready for the metals super-cycle,"This paper is devoted to test agents' behavior in the markets of hard commodities by trying to distinguish between managing future price structures to hedge their positions and speculating in on prices. We do a triple analysis: cointegration on the time series, structural breaks over the full time series and panel data. The analysis of the full series and the identification of structural breaks allows us to discover the connection between high prices and the negative futures price structure (backwardation) in rising prices scenarios of tin, copper, aluminium, and zinc. Moreover, we obtain that the base metals full matrix (price and futures price structure) is cointegrated in our analysis that uses panel data methods. We believe that these results are important for agents in the markets, as commodity traders or brokers, to maximize profits in their hedging positions.",2023-03-01,
Multivariate models of commodity futures markets: a dynamic copula approach,"We apply flexible multivariate dynamic models to capture the dependence structure of various US commodity futures across different sectors between 2004 and 2022; particular attention is paid to the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our copula-based models allow for time-varying nonlinear and asymmetric dependence by integrating elliptical and skewed copulas with dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) and block dynamic equicorrelation (Block DECO). Flexible copula models that allow for multivariate asymmetry and tail dependence are found to provide the best performance in characterizing co-movements of commodity returns. We also find that the connectedness between commodities has dramatically increased during the financial distress and the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts of the financial crisis appear to be more persistent than those of the pandemic. We apply our models to some risk management tasks in the commodity markets. Our results suggest that optimal portfolio weights based on dynamic copulas have persistently outperformed the equal-weighted portfolio, demonstrating the practicality and usefulness of our proposed models.",2023-02-12,
Co-movement between commodity and equity markets revisited—An application of the Thick Pen method,This paper analyses interdependence between the returns of specific energy and non-energy commodities and equities using (i) Thick Pen Measure of Association (TPMA) and (ii) Multi-Thickness Thick Pen Measure of Association (MTTPMA). We capture time-varying co-movement and co-movement across different time scales to analyse the short-term and long-term features of the time series using stationary data. Energy index futures show an increase in co-movement with equities since the start of the financialisation period. There are asymmetric effects in cross-scale co-movement between various commodities and equities. Weak co-movement between equity and specific commodity futures indicates diversification benefits for short-term and long-term investors.,2023-02-10,
Probability weighting in commodity futures markets,"Abstract Probability weighting refers to the behavioral bias in which irrational investors have a propensity to overweigh small probability tail events. In this study, we empirically investigate the asset pricing implications of probability weighting in commodity markets. We find that commodities with a high probability‐weighting value significantly underperform their low‐value pairs by 11% per annum. Neither conventional commodity risk factors nor existing characteristics explain this predictability. The predictability is more pronounced when arbitrage constraints are more binding. Commodities with a high probability‐weighting value also attract excess demand from non‐commercial traders. Collectively, these findings support a prospect theory‐based explanation for the cross‐section of commodity returns.",2023-02-08,
Co-explosivity versus leading effects: Evidence from crude oil and agricultural commodities,"Unlike previous studies investigating the interdependence and co-movements between different commodity prices, this paper examined the co-explosivity versus leading effects between the Brent oil prices and agricultural commodity prices. Empirically, we first date-stamped bubbles in the Brent and a set of agricultural commodities. Second, we examined possible existence of co-explosivity between these commodities' prices. Finally, by using predictive quantile regressions, we examined the leading effects of the crude oil market on agricultural commodity markets and vice versa. The results provide strong evidence for the presence of bubbles in the Brent oil price and the eight selected agricultural commodities' prices. In particular, we found that the year 2008 had the largest number of Brent-related bubbles, as well as a large proportion of bubbles in the studied agricultural commodities. However, although we found no evidence of co-explosivity between the different commodities, the results highlight strong evidence of the presence of leading effects from Brent oil prices to agricultural commodities for different lags. The reverse leading effect was found for only the corn and soybean commodities. The important implications for investors and market participants were presented and discussed.",2023-02-01,
A tale of two premiums revisited,"Abstract This paper investigates the effect of the “financialization” of commodity markets in terms of pricing. I explore whether the emergence of commodity index traders (CITs) affects weekly returns and turnover during the roll periods. I split the sample (1994–2017) into prefinancialization (1994–2003) and postfinancialization (2004–2017). I directly test whether the CIT market share (CIT/open interest) contributes to commodity returns and whether risk adjustments (based on momentum, basis, basis‐momentum, open interest, crowding, and average factors) alter liquidity and insurance premiums documented in Kang, Rouwenhorst, and Tang. I also examine how the financialization affects liquidity and insurance premiums. Finally, since previous results are obtained with Fama–MacBeth regressions, I use an alternative method to test how liquidity and insurance premiums determine commodity returns.",2023-01-26,
Investor sentiments and extreme risk spillovers from oil to stock markets: evidence from Asian countries,"This study seeks to investigate the extreme risk spillovers from crude oil to four major Asian stock markets from a market sentiment perspective. A copula-CoVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) approach is adopted to construct a dynamic network to capture the contributions of different types of market sentiment to the evolution of oil-stock risk nexus. The empirical evidence shows the presence of significant risk spillover effects from crude oil to equity markets. The dynamics of the oil-to-stock risk spillovers is shown to be significantly driven by market sentiments, mainly market fears in both stock markets and crude oil market triggered by prominent systemic events. As an extreme event unfolds, the oil-to-stock risk spillover dynamics is increasing susceptible to escalating market fears.",2023-01-23,
Markov-Regime Switches in Oil Markets: The Fear Factor Dynamics,"This paper is an attempt to examine regime switches in the empirical relation between return dynamics and implied volatility in energy markets. The time-varying properties of the return-generating process are defined as a function of several risk factors, including oil market volatility and changes in stock prices and currency rates. The empirical evidence is based on Markov-regime switching models, which have the capacity to capture, in particular, the stochastic behavior of the OVX oil volatility index as a benchmark for investors’ fear. The results suggest that the dynamics of oil market returns are governed by two distinct regimes, a state driven by a negative relationship between returns and implied volatility and another state characterized by a more pronounced negative correlation. It is the latter regime with a stronger correlation that tends to prevail over the sample period from 2008 to 2021, but the frequency of regime shifts also seems to increase under more volatile oil price dynamics in association with significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the evidence of a negative correlation structure is found to be robust to changes in the estimation period, which suggests that the oil volatility index remains a reliable gauge of market sentiment in the energy markets.",2023-01-23,
The geopolitical risk premium in the commodity futures market,"Abstract In this study, we investigate the geopolitical risk premium in the commodity futures market. By estimating the exposure of cross‐sectional commodity futures excess returns on a historical geopolitical risk index, we find that commodities with low‐risk betas generate 9.05% higher annual risk‐adjusted returns than those with high‐risk betas. The results indicate that low‐geopolitical‐risk‐related commodity futures contracts require extra compensation by risk‐averse investors due to hedging demand. We also explore the time‐varying characteristics of the geopolitical risk premium: It appears more pronounced during high‐geopolitical‐risk periods and before the year 2000. Finally, we exploit the subcategories of geopolitical risk and find that geopolitical threats better explain the variation of the geopolitical risk premium than do geopolitical acts, making it a main source of the geopolitical risk premium.",2023-01-18,
Modelling and forecasting risk dependence and portfolio VaR for cryptocurrencies,"In this paper, we investigate the co-dependence and portfolio value-at-risk of cryptocurrencies, with the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple price series from January 2016 to December 2021, covering the crypto crash and pandemic period, using the generalized autoregressive score (GAS) model. We find evidence of strong dependence among the virtual currencies with a dynamic structure. The empirical analysis shows that the GAS model smoothly handles volatility and correlation changes, especially during more volatile periods in the markets. We perform a comprehensive comparison of out-of-sample probabilistic forecasts for a range of financial assets and backtests and the GAS model outperforms the classic DCC (dynamic conditional correlation) GARCH model and provides new insights into multivariate risk measures.",2023-01-16,

Analysis of Risk Spillover and Asymmetry Between Three Crude Oil Markets and Chinese Financial Markets,"Providing a scientific basis and method to ensure the smooth functioning of the Chinese crude oil market would be hugely significant to China’s future economic development and security. To this end, attempts have been made to both internationalize the Shanghai crude oil market and minimize financial risks. This paper selects three crude oil markets (INE, WTI and Brent) and five Chinese financial markets (the futures, bond, fund, stock and foreign exchange markets) as the research objects. The Diebold and Yilmaz spillover index model and the multifractal asymmetric detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-ADCCA) method are used to study the volatility spillover effect and the asymmetric cross-correlation between crude oil markets and financial markets. When the volatility spillover effect and the asymmetric relationship that exists between the financial markets are examined, the volatility spillover of the oil market to the financial market is found to be significantly higher than that of the financial market to the oil market. In particular, the spillover effect was even more significant from late-2019 to early-2020. Analysis demonstrates an asymmetric cross-correlation between crude oil markets and the abovementioned five Chinese financial markets. In particular, the impact of the Chinese crude oil market on the stock market is greatest, especially with respect to the Brent and WTI crude oil markets. Except for the bond market, when the INE and Brent markets are increasing, the risk exposure to financial markets is more significant. Among financial markets, INE-Bond market asymmetry is stronger than WTI-bond market asymmetry, but weaker than that of the Brent-Bond market when there are large fluctuations.",2023-01-03,
When Benchmarks Fail: The Causes and Consequences of Negative Oil Prices,"On April 20, 2020 the flagship North American benchmark price for crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in Cushing, OK, fell below $0 for the first time in its history. We explore the causes and consequences of this event. Using a simple theoretical model, we argue that negative prices were the result of constraints on physical storage, but that these constraints were precipitated by positions of financial traders unable to take physical delivery prior to the expiration of the May 2020 futures contract. We then provide evidence that this event impacted the decisions of oil producers, including those not directly impacted by the storage constraints at Cushing, through their exposure to the WTI benchmark in their purchasing contracts. Our evidence suggests that asset price dislocations can have real effects due to their importance as contracting benchmarks.",2023-01-01,
Exogenous Oil Supply Shocks and Global Agricultural Commodity Prices,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 dramatically disrupted the global supply of crude oil and agricultural commodities. As a consequence, the prices of oil and agricultural commodities increase substantially and many countries face the problem of high food inflation. Against this background, based on the proxy structural vector autoregressions (SAVR), this paper identifies an oil supply shock that is exogenous to global real economic activity in the impact month, and then examines the impact of this shock on global agricultural commodity price fluctuations. We find unfavorable exogenous oil supply shocks have a delayed and significant positive impact on global agricultural commodity prices. Moreover, the significant positive effect of the unfavorable exogenous oil supply shock on global agricultural commodity prices is primarily attributable to the impact of the shock on the prices of oils and meals and the prices of grains. In particular, the prices of maize and soybeans are greatly affected by the shock. We also find the unfavorable exogenous oil supply shock affects global agricultural commodity prices partly through the biofuel production channel. These findings are very important for policymakers.",2023-01-01,
How should we think about common prosperity and challenges in the context of financialization?,"Abstract: China is actively promoting common prosperity to address the contradiction of unbalanced and inadequate development. Financialization has become the backdrop for common prosperity. How understanding the changing connotations of common prosperity and the factors influencing it in this context becomes the subject of this paper. We argue that the imbalance between income from assets and labor and the new forms of value generation are the reasons why common prosperity is difficult to achieve. To justify this conclusion, this paper examines financialization from the critical perspective of the Marxist political economy, cites the financialization case in China and discusses the real and ideological challenges facing common prosperity. The paper analyzes the nature of a new form of fetishism, financialization fetishism, and introduces the concept of narrative value, thus exposing the distortion of people’s value ideology by financialization fetishism and the obscuring and erosion of labor value by the mystification of narrative value.",2023-01-01,
"Intermarket Risk Transmission Across Energy, Carbon, and Commodities","This chapter mainly reviews three recent articles that examine the patterns of extreme risk connectedness across leading global energy firms, and the excess return co-movement across commodity markets, from a topological perspective to analyze the risk relationships. Among studies focusing on measuring the level of integration in the energy or commodity markets and the potential impacts of exogenous shocks, these studies explicitly study the risk relationships across firms or markets based on multivariate frameworks and seek to detect the structural vulnerability in a risk spillover network. Beyond identifying the systemically important components, these works recognize the leading driving forces of the information and risk spillovers in the energy or commodity system. The critical role of financial market dynamics, including market volatility and investors' sentiment, is confirmed in terms of affecting risk spillovers and return co-movement on the commodity side. The empirical findings are clearly relevant to policy, as the identification of such a risk-connectedness structure can provide a tool for ex ante risk evaluation to avoid systemic risk contagion and system-wide malfunctioning.",2023-01-01,
"Have the Causal Effects between Equities, Oil Prices, and Monetary Policy Changed Over Time?","We reexamine the contemporaneous causal effects between the U.S. stock prices, crude oil prices, and monetary policy from 2005 to 2023. Our study offers two main contributions. First, we generalize a novel identification approach based on exogenous intraday shifts in the volatility in futures markets from two markets to multiple markets. Second, we examine contemporaneous causal effects between the U.S. stock prices, crude oil prices, and monetary policy. We show that the coefficients measuring contemporaneous causality have substantially changed over time. Specifically, we find that since 2008 stock returns affect crude oil returns. This time variation is also evident in the effect of monetary policy on the crude oil returns. We show that this time variation is consistent with two explanations: the ZLB and increased synchronization of crude oil prices with the business cycle.",2023-01-01,
Understanding interlinkages between petroleum prices and equity markets: A comprehensive survey of empirical evidence,"The multifaceted interrelationship between petroleum prices and equity markets has been a subject of immense interest. The current paper offers an extensive review of a plethora of empirical studies in this strand of literature. By revealing various research themes, our survey points to diverse findings that are sector- and country-specific, and contingent on employed methodologies, data frequencies and time horizons. More precisely, petroleum price changes and shocks exert direct or indirect effects dictated by the level of petroleum dependency across sectors and the countries’ position as a net petroleum exporter or importer. The interlinkages tend to display the time-varying nature and sensitivity to major market events. In addition, volatility is not solely spilled from petroleum to equity markets, but it also observed to transmit in the reverse direction. The importance of incorporating asymmetries is documented. Finally, a few directions for expanding the existing research are proposed.",2023-01-01,
Models of Gold Options Market and Evidence in Favor of Financialized Gold and Against Disasterization,"This paper presents models for gold markets, which consists of four components: (i) uncertainty driven by idiosyncratic, jump, unspanned, and spanned risks; (ii) a semi-analytical representation for option risk premiums (and option prices); and (iii) models that can be estimated using quasi-maximum likelihood and Kalman filtering. The estimated models capture characteristics of the gold markets, such as the negative magnitudes of put option risk premiums, compatible with financialized gold. Furthermore, the estimated models are quantitatively relevant for option pricing, return volatilities, and VIXgold(t) evolution.",2023-01-01,
Energy Market Financialization and Its Policy Implications,"This chapter covers the basic conceptual issues of energy market financialization, its background, its development, and its impacts on energy markets. The trend of financialization has clearly brought new aspects to the energy markets in terms of pricing mechanisms and risks, which can have profound impacts on energy sectors. When the traditional driving factors, such as those from the demand and supply sides, mix with financial factors, the standard policy framework in the energy sector needs to be adjusted. Through reviewing the most recent literature and discussing relevant issues, this chapter aims to bring forward a collection of empirical evidence, a broad discussion of impacts, and, more importantly, the general implications for policymakers around the world. Overall, energy market financialization has already made great impacts to the traditional energy-pricing systems and energy risk management frameworks. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and taking financialization into energy policy frameworks have great meanings.",2023-01-01,
Contribution of Exchange Traded Funds in Hedging Crude Oil Price Risk,"In this study, we empirically analyze the contributions of three crude oil-based exchange traded funds (ETFs) and the futures contract in hedging crude oil price risk. In order to measure hedging contributions of ETFs, we estimate the usual minimum variance hedge ratios as well as the quantile based minimum variance hedge ratios based on three different methods. We also compute the hedging effectiveness of the futures contract and three ETFs. We find that ETFs can be used as hedging instruments especially for the longer hedging horizons and extreme quantiles. However, overall, we find the futures contract to be the most effective instrument for hedging.",2023-01-01,
"Market Surprises, Machine Learning and USDA Crop Progress and Condition Reports","Traditionally, a predefined surprise proxy (such as the consensus errors of analyst forecasts) is used to estimate the market impact of public announcements. We instead use the post-event price movements to tease out what the market consensus must have been, and to estimate the event-day surprises. Our empirical analysis focuses on the USDA's weekly Crop Progress and Condition reports (CPCRs), which we show can be forecasted using weather ""big"" data. Departing from conventional machine learning (ML) approaches, we create a new ML routine to incorporate important features of a market expectation model under the Efficient Market Hypothesis' semi-strong form. We find that the market often overestimates the condition of both crops by about 5-6%, with occasional spikes up to 22%. Moreover, these surprise estimates suggest that the reports still cause statistically significant post-release market reactions, though of small magnitudes.",2023-01-01,
Commodity Dependence and Optimal Asset Allocation,"We present a model to explain the diversification benefits of incorporating commodities into a portfolio of traditional assets from the perspective of domestic investors. Utilizing a sample of 38 countries from 2000 to 2020, we show that investors in high-commodity dependence countries generally do not benefit from adding commodities to their portfolios while investors located in low-commodity dependence countries usually do. Commodities may augment a diversified portfolio if investors are not excessively exposed to commodity risk through their country’s economic structure. Portfolio management research should consider the diversity of local contexts as it can yield different insights into asset allocation.",2023-01-01,
The Role of Index Traders in the Financialization of Commodity Markets: A Behavioral Finance Approach,"This paper investigates the impact of financialization on commodity prices across various markets, particularly over recent decades. We introduce a groundbreaking theoretical model that incorporates both chartist-fundamentalist traders and institutional investors, targeting trading signals in two distinct commodity markets. In alignment with empirical data, our model enables institutional investors to participate in multiple markets simultaneously through index investing. Our findings indicate that the interactions between traditional traders and index investors create price dynamics that closely mirror observed patterns in commodity markets. Specifically, index investors not only cause prices to diverge from their fundamental values but also substantially influence the trading posi- tions of other market actors. Moreover, we elucidate the crucial role of index investors in amplifying market correlations–both among different commodities and between commodities and equities, especially during periods of intense price fluctuations. Our innovative theoretical model goes beyond conventional chartist-fundamentalist frameworks, offering a robust alternative for understanding the complex pricing dynamics of commodities at large.",2023-01-01,
Do Commodity Factors Work as Inflation Hedges and Safe Havens?,"This study investigates whether commodity futures factor portfolios work as hedges and safe havens against inflation shocks. We observe that momentum, basis momentum, and a combination of factor portfolios act as strong hedges against core inflation shocks, suggesting that holding the factor portfolios generates not only higher Sharpe ratios but also strong hedge effects against inflation. Moreover, the momentum, basis momentum, and value portfolios have weak safe haven properties against inflation shocks. In addition, our empirical results suggest that hedge effects for commodity future portfolios are stronger during the pre-financialization period.",2023-01-01,
Exogenous Oil Supply Shocks and Agriculture: Energy Interplay in the Era of Climate Change,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 is one of several events in the past few decades that have disrupted the global supply of crude oil. During this period, the relationship between crude oil and agricultural commodities has become closer, due to the important role crude oil plays in the production of key agricultural inputs and the increasing importance of key agricultural crops as biofuel feedstocks. Consequently, an adverse oil supply shock could have a differential impact on feedstock and associated agricultural commodity prices compared with other agricultural commodities. In this paper, we investigate the impact of exogenous oil supply shocks on global agricultural commodity prices and provide insight into the relationship between oil and agricultural commodity prices. Utilizing a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) method, we discern that these negative oil supply disturbances considerably boost global agricultural commodity prices. This pronounced uptick, particularly in oils, meals, and grain prices -key biofuel feedstocks -suggests that such shocks, in part, influence agricultural prices through the biofuel production route.",2023-01-01,
Co-Jump Dynamicity in the Commodity Futures Markets,"This paper examines the co-jump transmission in 36 commodity futures returns using co-jump network models. Specifically, it analyses co-jumping behavior in both static and time-varying settings, considering the overall commodity markets and various commodity groups separately, which helps us understand the dynamic changes in co-jump dependencies at the overall and sector levels across time. The main results reveal that co-jump heterogeneity exists among commodities but is generally more apparent within each commodity group, and co-jumps vary over time. Gold exerts the strongest influence, with many commodity futures being influenced by the jumps behavior in gold returns. During the COVID-19 outbreak and the Russia-Ukraine war, the Energy group ranks highest in terms of co-jump network centrality. Some Agricultural and Metals commodity futures such as Lumber, Nickel and Palladium show a higher centrality ranking after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Our empirical analysis highlights the portfolio implications and an additional examination shows that centrality information from the co-jump network contains a highly and statistically forecasting power for US stock market volatility.",2023-01-01,
Determinants of Commodity Market Liquidity,"Using positions data for 18 commodity futures during 2001-2020, we examine systematic and idiosyncratic determinants of Amihud price impact and microstructure noise proxying for permanent and transitory components of commodity futures liquidity. Idiosyncratic factors have the largest economic impact: while excess hedging demand increases price impact and noise, active position taking (by market-makers) in excess of the hedging demand reduces noise. Systematic factors, including the lack of competition among liquidity providers, adversely impact liquidity, but this effect is mitigated if liquidity providers are well capitalized. Supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) makes holding inventory costlier and is associated with lower liquidity.",2023-01-01,
Rare Disaster Concerns in Predicting Oil,"We construct a text-based measure of oil market uncertainty employing front-page articles from the Wall Street Journal, spanning from January 1986 to December 2022. Our measure, news implied oil price volatility (NOV ), is derived from an extensive dataset comprising over 100,000 articles. It effectively captures fluctuations in oil market uncertainty during significant historical events. Following Manela and Moreira (2017), we further decompose NOV into six distinct categories, each designed to capture various types of rare disaster concerns. Our analysis reveals that the news-based disaster concerns index (DI) is a primary driver of variation in oil returns, both in and out of sample. Notably, disaster concerns related to financial intermediation and security markets play a particularly significant role. We also propose a potential economic explanation for this oil price prediction using the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) method. Our findings suggest that although disaster concerns impact both oil supply and demand, it is the demand-driven nature of oil that has resulted in lower oil prices.",2023-01-01,
New Tests of the Theory of Storage and the Theory of Normal Backwardation: Time and Frequency Dimensions,"Our time-frequency analysis of the oil futures market from 1986 to 2020 yields distinct findings: inventory leads the basis at the business cycle, supporting the theory of storage; meanwhile, at shorter periods post-2005, the basis leads inventory, indicating arbitrage activities. Hedging pressure and inventory lead futures risk premium at the business cycle in certain times, with intermittent support for the theory of normal backwardation. Futures risk premium and hedging pressure relationship breaks down in 2005, coinciding with a known market structural change. At the shortest periods, we document a positive relationship between risk premium and hedging pressure, aligning with recent research. Our study underscores the significance of considering the data measurement period when evaluating the theories of storage and normal backwardation.",2023-01-01,
Volatility Spillover of Indexed Commodities: Characteristics and Determinants,"This paper analyzes the volatility spillover effects of U.S. indexed commodities over a 22-year period using a generalized forecast error variance decomposition approach. The results suggest that static spillovers tend to be positive with a stronger downside volatility spillover effect, while dynamic spillovers exhibit time-varying features, especially during economic crises. Additionally, the study explores the determinants of spillover changes and finds that the credit default swap spread is positively related to spillovers, explaining 40%-50% of contemporaneous spillover changes. Commodity financialization and quantitative easing have weaker explanatory power. Overall, the findings shed light on the volatility spillover of indexed commodities.",2023-01-01,
Macroeconomic Attention and Commodity Market Volatility,"In this paper, we empirically examine the relationship between the novel macroeconomic attention indices (MAI) and commodity market volatility. In-sample analysis indicates that MAI contribute significantly to the volatility fluctuations in commodity markets. In addition, we employ dimension reduction techniques, shrinkage methods, and combination models in an out-of-sample exercise to assess the predictive ability of MAI, alongside a variety of economic predictors including uncertainty measures, and global as well as US economic indicators. Our empirical results demonstrate the superior predictive ability of the elastic net and LASSO models incorporating MAI together with macroeconomic and uncertainty indicators. This empirical finding is reinforced through a series of robustness checks. However, dimension reduction methods exhibit superior performance in longer forecast horizons. Finally, MAI are more informative for commodity volatility forecasting during economic expansions and non-crisis periods. Our study offers new insights on commodity volatility forecasting.",2023-01-01,
Prices and the activities of financial investors in global commodities markets in the 21st century,"It is generally considered that rising inflation is a negative development. However, in the case of investments in stock markets (regulated and unregulated), this situation is not so obvious and clear-cut. Rising prices in global commodity markets are generally accompanied by an increase in investor activity in over-the-counter markets. It can therefore be anticipated that the rise in global inflation is a phenomenon that drives the pro-investment activities of OTC investors. However, is this correlation so obvious and invariable over time? The study is focused on the research of the relations between financial investors activities and the changes in prices on the global commodity markets in the 21st century. The study conducted a correlation (correlation and regression) analysis for global inflation and OTC investment from 2005 to 2022, showing that the period analyzed was not uniform. The main tool used during the research is econometric model estimation with use feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) method.",2023-01-01,
EXPLORING THE ASYMMETRIC EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC POLICY UNCERTAINTY AND IMPLIED VOLATILITIES ON ENERGY FUTURES RETURNS: NOVEL INSIGHTS FROM QUANTILE-ON-QUANTILE REGRESSION,"This study examined the asymmetric effects of major uncertainty and volatility indices (economic policy uncertainty, Chicago Board Options Exchange crude oil volatility, CBOE volatility index, CBOE VIX volatility, and NASDAQ 100 volatility target) on the returns of global energy and its constituents (global energy index, Brent, heating oil, natural gas, and petroleum). The causalityin-quantiles test and the quantile-on-quantile regression technique were employed on daily data covering the period between April 2012 and March 2022. The findings evidenced asymmetries and heterogeneity in the causal effects of global uncertainty and market volatilities on energy markets. For all uncertainty and volatility measures, we found strong negative relationships with energy commodities at stressed conditions, signalling some hedging benefits for market participants. The current research is among the first investigations to explore the asymmetric relationships between major uncertainty and volatility indices, as well as global energy and its constituents. Essential portfolio implications of our findings are discussed.",2022-12-29,
COVID‐19 and tail risk contagion across commodity futures markets,"Abstract This paper examines the impact of COVID‐19 on tail risk contagion across commodity futures markets using a copula‐based network method. We document a significant increase in the lower and upper tail contagiousness of commodities following the COVID‐19 outbreak. Contagion shows an obvious clustering characteristic, that is, there is higher tail risk connectedness between commodities in the same category. Agricultural commodities are significantly less contagious than metals and energy commodities; soft commodities in particular can offer investors significant diversification benefits. There are several hub commodities in the contagion network, chief among them copper, which are good transmitters of shocks and should be treated with caution by investors and regulators. Although tail risk and contagiousness of individual commodities increase together during the pandemic, we find a negative cross‐sectional relationship between tail risk and contagiousness, that is, commodities with high tail risk are not necessarily highly contagious and may even be less so.",2022-12-05,
The effect of the US dollar exchange rate on oil prices: An oil financialization perspective,"Abstract This study investigates the regime‐specific relationship between the USD exchange rate and oil prices. We embed the threshold variables of structural breaks and oil financialization into the VAR model of the dollar–oil relationship. Using daily data from 1983 to 2022, we find that a marked structural change in the dollar–oil relation exists in 2001 and that deepening oil financialization drives the structural change, making the portfolio effect the dominant effect of the dollar on oil prices. After 2001, the dollar negatively affects oil prices in both the long and short run. Furthermore, our threshold regression based on the investor self‐adaptive expectation model shows that investor expectations significantly affect the dollar–oil relationship under oil financialization. A sharp increase in USD exchange rate volatility would strengthen investors' unilateral expectation of the trend of the USD exchange rate, which further enhances the portfolio effect, resulting in an even stronger negative effect of the dollar on oil prices.",2022-11-15,
The Impact of the Ukrainian War on Stock and Energy Markets: A Wavelet Coherence Analysis,"This study attempts to examine the existence of interdependencies between specific stock market indices, exchange rates and crude oil for the period January 2021 to July 2022 with daily data. In the period we have chosen, the post-vaccination phase against COVID-19, as well as the war in Ukraine, is covered. The variables selected for this study are RTSI, Eurostoxx, S&amp;P 500, EUR/USD and RUB/USD exchange rates and crude oil prices. The selection of the specific variables was made because they are directly related to the pre-war period that coincides with the post-vaccine period of the pandemic, which allowed us to characterize it as the normal period and to characterize the period of the war in Ukraine that coincides with the energy crisis as the unstable period. In this way, the present study covers the markets of Russia and other developed economies. For empirical purposes, we applied a wavelet coherence approach in order to investigate the possible existence of simultaneous coherence between the variables at different times and scales for all the considered times. The findings of the study reveal the existence of strong correlations between all variables, during different time periods and for different frequencies during the period under review. Of particular interest is the finding that shows that during the crisis period, the RTSI significantly affects both the European and American stock markets, while also determining the evolution of the Russian currency. In addition, it appears that capital constraints in the Russian stock market, combined with increased demand for crude oil, determine the interdependence between RTSI and crude oil. Finally, an interesting finding of the study is the existence of a negative correlation between the US stock index and crude oil in low-frequency bands and the RTSI and Eurostoxx with crude oil for the post-vaccination and pre-war periods in the medium term. These findings can be used by both investors and portfolio managers to hedge risks and make more confident investment decisions. In addition, these findings can be used by policy makers in the planning of regulatory policies regarding the limitations of the systemic risks in capital markets.",2022-11-02,
Uncertainty diffusion across commodity markets,"While numerous studies investigate volatility transmission across commodity markets, particularly oil and agricultural markets, uncertainty diffusion across commodity markets remains absent from the literature. This circumstance is primarily related to the lack of appropriate measures of commodity price uncertainty, which differs from volatility. This study focuses on measuring commodity price uncertainty and how it is transferred from one commodity market to another. Our contributions are twofold. (i) We construct an aggregate predictability-based measure of uncertainty for each group of commodity markets and different maturities, and (ii) we analyse uncertainty diffusion across different commodity markets using a vector autoregressive model. Our findings clearly demonstrate a bi-causal uncertainty transfer between agriculture, energy, and industrial markets, excluding precious metals markets. Additionally, the industrial commodity market is assumed to be the transmission channel of commodity uncertainty spread, given its close link with global economic activity. Notably, we validate the efficacy of using industrial uncertainty as a proxy for macroeconomic uncertainty. Finally, our confirmation of precious metals' insensitivity to other markets' shocks reinforces its nature as a safe haven.",2022-10-14,
Jump Dynamics and Leverage Effect: Evidences from Energy Exchange Traded Fund (ETFs),"Abstract This paper is concerned with the behavior of energy ETF prices. It applies three models: autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), along with their revised forms, ARMA–Exponential-GARCH, Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle (GJR), and GARCH diffusion process with jump models. This study looks at the volatility behavior and jumps dynamics of Energy and Master Limited Partnership's (MLP) ETFs. The results show that ARMA-GARCH is appropriate for modeling energy and MLP ETFs. Both ETFs offer positive leverage and asymmetric volatility. The results show that the jump model with a GARCH volatility specification has an actual amount of jump presence and time variation in the jump size distribution. The conclusion of the ARMA - EGARCH model gives evidence of the reverse leverage effect. The leverage term positively influences the conditional variance, while the asymmetry coefficient for the GJR model is positive and significant. These results reveal that both Energy and MLPs ETF have high volatility. JEL classification numbers: F3. Keywords: Energy ETFs, MLPs, ARMA-GARCH model, Volatility Asymmetry, Leverage and Jump Effect.",2022-10-12,
Commodity momentum decomposition,"Abstract This study decomposes the momentum factor (MOM) in the commodity futures market. A high‐to‐price (HTP) factor generates a higher Sharpe ratio than a price‐to‐high (PTH) factor. We uncover that the profitability mechanisms across three momentum factors are different. The positive returns on MOM and PTH are associated with overconfidence and strong self‐attribution. In contrast, HTP is linked to investors' underreaction and the information diffusion process. Moreover, we find that positive demand shocks raise the return on HTP.",2022-10-01,
Time-frequency connectedness between food commodities: New implications for portfolio diversification,"This study examines the time-frequency connectedness of food commodities (cereals, dairy, food, meat, vegetable oil, and sugar) in the Food and Agriculture Organization's world food indices. With a monthly-frequency dataset covering February 1990 to October 2021, we utilise the returns spillover index approach of Baruník and Křehlík (2018). The results are robust to the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) connectedness approach. The findings explicate that food commodities are highly connected in the short- and long-term horizons. The dynamic total connectedness varies from 15% to 80% in the short term, 1% to 70%, in the medium-term, and 1% to 75% in the long-term, with high fluctuations in notable crisis periods. Contagious returns spillovers between food commodities are propagated by vegetable oil. Diversification and safe-haven properties of food commodities are consistently found in the meat market across tranquil and exuberant trading periods, respectively. The safe-haven role of sugar in recent episodes of financial crises is highlighted by our findings. The economic, policy, and portfolio implications of our results are discussed.",2022-09-27,
Commodity market dynamics: Who's behind booms and busts?,"Existing literature has relied on economic fundamentals (EFs) to determine commodity price booms and busts. This framework has been unable to account for major economic non-fundamentals (ENFs). This study takes a broader view of major ENFs that expands beyond the traditional demand and supply indicators to evaluate the response of commodity price booms and busts at both aggregate and disaggregate levels. To obtain consistent estimates, this study utilizes the advantages of the dynamic fixed-effect within instrumental variable method as an estimator to evaluate the behavior of 37 agricultural, energy, and metal commodity prices over 1980–2020. Our results indicate that relative to EFs, ENFs are the predominant driving force of commodity price booms and bursts at aggregate levels. In the case of EFs, the demand-side stimulates commodity prices, whereas the supply-side tends to depress them; however, the former effect tends to outweigh the latter effect. However, on the ENFs front, the dollar-denominated variable is one of the most powerful factors behind commodity price soars and bursts. Meanwhile, at the disaggregate level, the impact of EFs and ENFs is in tandem with that of the aggregate-level commodities. However, world uncertainty tends to depress the prices of energy and metal commodities. Our analysis implies that global demand and supply generated booms and busts in commodity prices have macroeconomic effects on both exporting and importing economies. Along with that, policymakers may need to consider the role of the rise and fall in the value of the dollar as well as that of the financialization of commodities, which were found to have a significant effect on commodity price booms and busts. Countries thus need to devise policies that may help moderate the negative effects of world uncertainty and geopolitical risk.",2022-09-23,
Economic imperatives of financialization of agricultural commodity markets,"Purpose. The purpose of the article is to substantiate the theoretical and methodological foundations and economic feasibility of intensifying the processes of financialization of the business model of Ukrainian grain producers, in particular through the formation of the grain futures market and the creation of commodity exchange in Ukraine. &#x0D; Methodology / approach. In the article, it is clarified the concept of financialization as one of the global trends of economic development that provides deep integration of financial and real economy on macro- and micro levels. Hedge effectiveness of price risks for Ukrainian grain (wheat and corn) using futures contracts traded on CME Group and Euronext is evaluated using regression analysis. Ukrainian wheat and corn FOB price volatility for 2016–2021 marketing years is estimated. The dynamics and volatility of the basis for Ukrainian wheat and corn and respective futures contracts traded on CME Group and Euronext are analyzed. &#x0D; Results. The analysis of securitization index of global agricultural markets has shown an increase of its financialization rate. The main reasons for this process were the deepening of financial and commodity markets integration, deregulation of financial markets and introduction of new financial instruments. The structure of the grain market in Ukraine is analyzed, particularly the role of agricultural holdings and international companies. The tendencies and determinants of wheat and corn market prices in Ukraine during marketing year are revealed. Regression analysis of hedge effectiveness has shown that all considered futures contracts are suitable for wheat and corn CPT and FOB price hedging in Ukraine. The highest hedge effectiveness was revealed for Black Sea Corn Financially Settled (Platts) Futures) (CME Group) and Milling Wheat / Ble de Meunerie (Euronext Matif). Short hedge efficiency of CME Group futures contracts was supported by analysis of basis dynamics for Ukrainian wheat and corn and respective futures contracts. &#x0D; Originality / scientific novelty. Based on the analysis of the theoretical foundations of financialization, the positive and negative consequences of the strengthening of financialization of global commodity markets and the peculiarities of the functioning of the modern grain market in Ukraine, the economic imperatives of the development of the Ukrainian market of grain derivatives, as an objectively determined trend of agricultural commodity market, are substantiated. The evaluation of the effectiveness of hedging price risks on the Ukrainian grain markets using derivatives traded on global exchanges has gained further development.&#x0D; Practical value / implications. It is proposed to intensify market tools usage for risk hedging in Ukraine in order to cover interests of all market participants. Risk management instruments available for Ukrainian agricultural producers are discussed.",2022-09-20,
Currency and commodity return relationship under extreme geopolitical risks: evidence from the invasion of Ukraine,"We examine the relationship between currency and commodity returns around the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. We find that the expected positive contemporaneous relationship between currency and commodity returns reverses and becomes negative during this period of extreme geopolitical risks. In addition to commodity returns, currency returns around the invasion of Ukraine are significantly affected by geopolitical factors, particularly geographic distance to the war. Our results indicate that a war between two major commodity-exporting countries significantly affects global currency pricing.",2022-09-14,
Integration between emerging market equity and global markets; is it fundamental or noisy? Evidence from wavelet denoised volatility spillover analysis in time and frequency domain,"The study investigates the integration between the five largest emerging stock markets, Morgan Stanley Capital Emerging Market Index, and global financial markets like the US S&P 500, Brent Crude Oil and Dollar Index based on wavelet denoised volatility spillover in time and frequency domain using forecasted error variance decomposition framework. It is found that the impact of noise on the connectedness is more pronounced in the short run and declines in longer term. Further, long-term connectedness which is much higher than that of short-term connectedness confirms the existence of fundamental (noisy) concernedness in the long (short) term. The impact of noise both varies by time and frequency. The policy implications are discussed.",2022-09-09,
Commodities as an Asset Class,"Commodities have become increasingly important as an additional source of diversification. However, commodities are relatively unexplored as an asset class. Within the context of the financialization of commodity markets, we study three fundamental questions about commodities as an asset class: What determines commodity prices, why do some commodities offer higher returns than other commodities, and is there momentum in commodity markets? In this thesis, the net convenience yield as a latent payoff of a commodity is in particular taken into account to answer these questions.",2022-09-08,
Price co-movements in decentralized financial markets,"In decentralized finance (Defi), market participants are allowed to have the right to manage their own funds as opposed to centralized finance (Cefi) with a central custodian, centralized exchanges (CEX). Most Defi projects provide their own service and simultaneously issue a unique token that can be traded in decentralized exchanges (DEX). However, the values of these tokens have rarely been studied. We confirm that the prices of tokens in the Defi market have a persistent tendency to move together. We also demonstrate that the correlation gradually increased from the Defi market's inception and the price co-movement increased in a bear market, and conversely, decreased in a bull market. Specifically, we find a notable difference in the level of price co-movement between CEX cryptocurrencies and DEX tokens.",2022-09-06,
Time-frequency analysis of financial stress and global commodities prices: Insights from wavelet-based approaches,"We examine the time-frequency lead–lag relationships and the degree of integration between the US financial stress index and global commodity prices (i.e., oil, gold, silver, and cocoa) with data covering over 47 decades (January 1975 to December 2021). For this purpose, we resort to the bi- and multiple wavelet econometric approaches. Findings from the bivariate wavelet analysis evidence the significant influence of the US financial stress in driving the price-generating process in commodities markets. Our findings support the hedging abilities of commodities across the time-frequency space. Findings from the multiple correlations explicate that the interrelation between the commodities and financial stress is attributable to their interdependence in the long term during financial market meltdowns. The dynamic and nonhomogeneous lead/lag relations underscored by our findings highlight the importance of cross-commodity investments. As such, by acknowledging the response of different commodities to financial stress, asset allocation should factor in commodities that offer opposing responses to a financial stress to hedge downside risks associated with portfolios. Our findings are of interest to regulators, risk managers, investors, and commodities producers.",2022-08-28,
Dynamic connectedness among the implied volatilities of oil prices and financial assets: New evidence of the COVID-19 pandemic,"This paper examines the dynamic connectedness among the implied volatilities of oil prices (OVX) and fourteen other assets, which can be grouped into five different assets classes (i.e., energy commodities, stock markets, precious metals, exchange rates and bond markets). To do so we estimate a recently developed time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) connectedness approach using daily data spanning from March 16th, 2011 to March 3rd, 2021 — covering the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results suggest that connectedness across the different asset classes and oil price implied volatilities are varying over time and fluctuate at very high levels. The dynamic total connectedness ranges between 65% and 85% indicating a high degree of cross-market risk linkages. Furthermore, we find that the oil market is becoming more integrated with the financial markets, since it tends to be materially impacted by abrupt fluctuations of the global financial markets' volatilities. More specifically, the analysis shows that, throughout the period, OVX is a net receiver of shocks to the remaining implied volatilities. Finally, the net pairwise connectedness measures suggest that OVX is constantly at the net receiving end vis-a-vis the majority of the asset classes' implied volatilities. Those findings are of major importance for portfolio and risk management in terms of asset allocation and diversification.",2022-08-22,
Network Analysis of Price Comovements Among Corn Futures and Cash Prices,"Abstract Due to significant implications for resource and food sectors that directly influence social well-being, commodity price comovements represent an important issue in agricultural economics. In this study, we approach this issue by concentrating on daily prices of the corn futures market and 496 cash markets from 16 states in the United States for the period of July 2006 – February 2011 through correlation based hierarchical analysis and synchronization analysis, which allow for determining interactions and interdependence among these prices, heterogeneities in price synchronization, and their changing patterns over time. As the first study of the issue focusing on prices of the futures and hundreds of spatially dispersed cash markets for a commodity of indubitable economic significance, empirical findings show that the degree of comovements is generally higher after March 2008 but no persistent increase is observed. Different groups of cash markets are identified, each of which has its members exhibit relatively stable price synchronization over time that is generally at a higher level than the synchronization among the futures and all of the 496 cash markets. The futures is not found to show stable price synchronization with any cash market. Certain cash markets have potential of serving as cash price leaders. Results here benefit resource and food policy analysis and design for economic welfare. The empirical framework has potential of being adapted to network analysis of prices of different commodities.",2022-08-22,
The network of commodity risk,"Abstract In this paper, we investigate the interconnections among and within the Energy, Agricultural, and Metal commodities, operating in a risk management framework with a twofold goal. First, we estimate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) employing GARCH and Markov-switching GARCH models with different error term distributions. The use of such models allows us to take into account well-known stylized facts shown in the time series of commodities as well as possible regime changes in their conditional variance dynamics. We rely on backtesting procedures to select the best model for each commodity. Second, we estimate the sparse Gaussian Graphical model of commodities exploiting the Graphical LASSO (GLASSO) methodology to detect the most relevant conditional dependence structure among and within the sectors. A novel feature of our framework is that GLASSO estimation is achieved exploring the precision matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution obtained using a Gaussian copula with marginals given by the residuals of the aforementioned selected models. We apply our approach to the sample of twenty-four series of commodity futures prices over the years 2005–2022. We find that Soybean Oil, Cotton, and Coffee represent the major sources of propagation of financial distress in commodity markets while Gold, Natural Gas UK, and Heating Oil are depicted as safe-haven commodities. The impact of Covid-19 is reflected in increased heterogeneity, as captured by the strongest relationships between commodities belonging to the same commodity sector and by weakened inter-sectorial connections. This finding suggests that connectedness does not always increase in response to crisis events.",2022-08-20,
"Rebalancing effects of commodity indices on open interest, volume and prices","The investment volume for commodity indices has increased rapidly over the past years. This financialization is intensively discussed in politics and science with mixed results because of several problems. We use a novel idea to measure the effect of the growing investment volume of index investors by looking at index rebalancing, in which only financial traders are forced to trade. Analyzing 289 rebalancing between 2006 and 2021 for the BCOM and the S&P GSCI, we observe significant results—with abnormal returns up to 14.1%—only for open interest and volume data. We cannot prove an effect on prices and, therefore, no effect of financialization on the real economy.",2022-08-09,
Investing in Commodities in Times of Uncertainty and Lax Monetary Policy,"This chapter presents empirical evidence showing the impact of economic uncertainty and monetary policy on the volatility of commodity futures markets. The findings are in line with those of the relevant literature according to which rising uncertainty predicts rising volatility in commodity markets. The author shows that the unobservable economic uncertainty measures of Jurado et al. (2015) have a significant and long-lasting positive impact on the volatility of commodity prices. Hence, the OLS regression results show that commodity markets are significantly affected by the rising degree of unpredictability in the macroeconomy, while they are relatively immune to observable macroeconomic fluctuations. The expansionary monetary policy is followed by rising volatility in agricultural and energy markets, while it has much smaller effect on the volatility of metals markets. Financialization in commodity markets has increased the dynamic linkages between monetary policy shocks and commodity price volatility.",2022-08-05,
Global commodity and equity markets spillovers to Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This paper examines the connectedness among 12 African equity markets and the global commodity, developed equity markets, paying particular attention to their evolution during the COVID-19 pandemic's peak period. We find that whilst African equity markets connect weakly to these markets, the levels of connectedness among these markets improved significantly during the pandemic. In addition, the energy market dominates the transmission of shocks in the system with commodity markets. Regarding the system with equity markets, the French and South African equity markets transmit the highest spillover in the full sample and during the pandemic's peak period, respectively.",2022-08-04,
Forecasting Crude Oil Future Volatilities with a Threshold Zero-Drift GARCH Model,"The recent price crash of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil futures contract, which occurred on 20 April 2020, has caused history-writing movements of relative prices. For instance, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) experienced a negative price. Explosive heteroskedasticity is also evidenced in associated products, such as the Intercontinental Exchange Brent (BRE) and Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) crude oil futures. Those movements indicate potential non-stationarity in the conditional volatility with an asymmetric influence of negative shocks. To incorporate those features, which cannot be accommodated by the existing generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models, we propose a threshold zero-drift GARCH (TZD-GARCH) model. Our empirical studies of the daily INE returns from March 2018 to April 2020 demonstrate the usefulness of the TZD-GARCH model in understanding the empirical features and in precisely forecasting the volatility of INE. Robust checks based on BRE and WTI over various periods further lead to highly consistent results. Applications of news impact curves and Value-at-Risk (VaR) analyses indicate the usefulness of the proposed TZD-GARCH model in practice. Implications include more effectively hedging risks of crude oil futures for policymakers and market participants, as well as the potential market inefficiency of INE relative to WTI and BRE.",2022-08-03,
Index tracking and beta arbitrage effects in comovement,"This paper develops a stylised model for S&P 500 index changes with two beta-based styles: index trackers and beta arbitrageurs who trade in both high and low beta event stocks to exploit mean reversion towards one. Arbitrageurs engage in common or contrarian trading patterns relative to index funds depending on whether historical betas are below or above one. Thus, the overall comovement effect has two distinct components. After index additions, pre-event low beta stocks drive the overall beta increases due to common demand – albeit for different reasons - from indexers and arbitrageurs. By contrast, arbitrageur shorting of high beta additions diminishes or sometimes reverses the beta increases for these stocks driven by indexers. Analogous results hold for index deletions.",2022-07-31,
Time‐varying pure contagion effect between energy and nonenergy commodity markets,"Abstract This paper combines the Kalman filtering technique and the time‐varying parameter vector autoregression model with stochastic volatility model to explore pure contagion effects between energy and nonenergy (i.e., industrial metals, precious metals, and agricultural) commodity markets. Empirical results show the significant pure contagion effects between energy and industrial metals markets in most periods, while pure contagion effects between energy and precious metals and agricultural markets occur only in a few specific periods. Comparing the level of pure contagion effects between different commodity markets, energy is still the main price transmitter. In addition, with the acceleration of the global commodity market financialization process, the frequency and harm of pure contagion effects are gradually increasing. Notably, the COVID‐19 pandemic is emerging as another major crisis after the global financial crisis, exacerbating the pure contagion effects between energy and precious metals and agricultural markets.",2022-07-20,
The role of investor sentiment in forecasting housing returns in China: A machine learning approach,"Abstract This paper analyzes the predictive ability of aggregate and disaggregate proxies of investor sentiment, over and above standard macroeconomic predictors, in forecasting housing returns in China, using an array of machine learning models. We find that our new aligned investor sentiment index has greater predictive power for housing returns than the principal component analysis (PCA)‐based sentiment index, used earlier in the literature. Moreover, shrinkage models utilizing the disaggregate sentiment proxies do not result in forecast improvement indicating that aligned sentiment index optimally exploits information in the disaggregate proxies of investor sentiment. Furthermore, when we let the machine learning models to choose from all key control variables and the aligned sentiment index, the forecasting accuracy is improved at all forecasting horizons, rather than just the short‐run as witnessed under standard predictive regressions. This result suggests that machine learning methods are flexible enough to capture both structural change and time‐varying information in a set of predictors simultaneously to forecast housing returns of China in a precise manner. Given the role of the real estate market in China's economic growth, our result of accurate forecasting of housing returns has important implications for both investors and policymakers.",2022-07-16,
Modeling tail risk in Indian commodity markets using conditional EVT-VaR and their relation to the stock market,"Investment in commodity markets in India accelerated after 2007; this was accompanied by large price variability, hence, it becomes imperative to measure commodity price risk precisely. It becomes equally important to study the relationship between commodity price variability and the stock market. Hence, this study aims to calculate the tail risk of highly traded Indian commodity futures returns using the conditional EVT-VaR method for risk measurement. Secondly, the linkage between commodity markets and the stock market is also studied using the Delta CoVaR method. Results highlight the following points. There is risk transfer from the extreme increase/decrease in crude oil futures returns to the Nifty Index returns. Both extreme price increase or decrease of crude oil futures driven either by financial or a combination of financial and economic shocks affect the stock market. Zinc and Natural gas futures are not linked to the stock market, which means they can be useful in portfolio diversification. The findings suggest that, in Indian commodity markets, EVT-VaR is a useful tool for measuring risk. Only Crude oil futures shocks affect the stock market, and extreme integration between them becomes more prominent when oil shocks are driven by financial factors. Commodities other than Crude oil are not integrated with stock markets in India.",2022-07-07,
ICEEMDAN-Based Transfer Entropy between Global Commodity Classes and African Equities,"We examine the information transfer dynamics between global commodity and African equity markets to test their efficiency levels in a denoised transfer entropy approach. Our findings in the short- and medium-term scales lend support to the alternative hypothesis of market efficiency, whereas the transfer entropies at the long-term scale lend support to the efficient market hypothesis and the long-term market efficiency. Investing in a single commodity results in high uncertainty when the return pattern (history) of African equities is acknowledged. Similarly, investing in any single African equity results in high return uncertainty whilst accounting for the history of commodity markets’ returns. Short-term traders could monitor the loopholes in the market efficiency levels between global commodities and African equities to take advantage of arbitrage when needed, whilst long-term investors are assured of efficient market dynamics between global commodity markets and African equities. Regulation of markets may need to strategically incorporate news items as they fall due to either market.",2022-07-06,
Commodity Financialization and Information Transmission,"ABSTRACT We provide a model to understand the effects of commodity futures financialization on various market variables. We distinguish between financial speculators and financial hedgers and study their separate and combined effects on the informativeness of futures prices, the futures price bias, the comovement of futures prices with other markets, and the predictiveness of financial trading. We capture the interactions between commodity futures financialization and the real economy through spot prices and production decisions. A dynamic extension illustrates how key variables change over time in a period of acute financialization in a way that is consistent with observed empirical patterns.",2022-06-15,
Exploring the dynamics of the equity–commodity nexus: A study of base metal futures,"Abstract This empirical exercise explores different aspects of the time‐varying linkage between the commodity and equity markets in India, focusing on base metal futures. The Dynamic Conditional Correlation model (2002) and Diebold–Yilmaz spillover index (2012) are employed to ascertain the presence, pattern, direction, and magnitude of the connectedness between the returns of base metal futures and related equity indices over the period of 2006–2019. The study builds on a less‐studied “input” channel of linkage between the two, reckoning with the economic fundamentals of demand–supply interaction. Our results show that 36% of the return forecast error variance originates from spillovers, to which the contribution of equity indices is minimal. It indicates segmentation between the two markets which offer the scope for potential diversification. Further, base metal futures are the net transmitters and equity indices are the net recipients of spillovers. Positive correlations outweigh the negative correlations, in both frequency and magnitude.",2022-06-12,
Impact of Oil Financialization on Oil Price Fluctuation: A Perspective of Heterogeneity,"A large number of studies have confirmed that oil speculation has played a vital role in oil price fluctuation in recent years. However, the heterogeneous impact of oil financialization on oil price fluctuation has not received enough attention. Based on time series data from January 1990 to October 2021, this paper adopts the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Auto-Regression (TVP-VAR) model and the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method to study the heterogeneous impact of oil financialization on oil price fluctuation from three perspectives: different periods, different frequencies, and different time points of major events. The research results are as follows. First, the impact of oil financialization on oil price fluctuation in different periods is heterogeneous in terms of fluctuation amplitude and intensity. During major events such as the financial crisis or the COVID pandemic, the impact of oil financialization on oil price fluctuation is volatile and intense. Second, the impact of oil financialization on the oil price fluctuation of different frequencies is mainly reflected in the direction and duration. Oil financialization mainly promotes high-frequency oil price fluctuation in the short term, and it mainly suppresses low-frequency oil price fluctuation in the long term. Third, the impact of oil financialization on oil price fluctuation is heterogeneous in terms of duration, intensity, and transmission speed at different time points of major events.",2022-06-11,
The order flow cost of index rolling in commodity futures markets,"Abstract Commodity index rolling is treated as a natural experiment and an event study of order flow costs in a wide array of futures markets is conducted. The spread between nearby and deferred futures prices decreases significantly in the early and growth phases of financialization (1991–2011), with the spreads reversing back after rolling is completed. Spread impacts disappear in the post‐financialization period (2012–2019). We argue that a dramatic increase in the supply of liquidity brought on by the transition to electronic trading in commodity futures markets is primarily responsible for the decline of roll order flow costs.",2022-06-08,
THE IMPACT OF OIL PRICE UNCERTAINTY ON US STOCK RETURNS,"Oil price uncertainty has a negative and significant impact on stock returns during the period of 2003–2020 but not the earlier period of 1984–2002. The impact of stock price uncertainty on oil returns for both periods is not significant. Oil price uncertainty is important in examining stock price movement, particularly during years of financial crises. Cross-market causalities in returns and volatilities are not significant in both directions.",2022-05-24,
The volatility risk premium in the oil market,"This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the volatility risk premium (VRP) in the oil market. We approach the problem from the practitioner’s perspective as an investment strategy that sells and delta-hedges oil options, paying particular attention to the strategy’s risk-adjusted returns and its drawdown characteristics. The results are differentiated across options with different moneyness and expirations and presented in the form of VRP smile and VRP term structure. Strategy results are analyzed using alternative delta-hedging techniques that vary hedging frequencies, hedging thresholds, and volatilities used to calculate options’ delta. We discuss the performance under different regimes and highlight the structural break driven by the changing behavior among main participants in the oil options market.",2022-05-18,
El Niño and Commodity Prices: New Findings From Partial Wavelet Coherence Analysis,"This study investigates whether the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects primary commodity prices over time. We employ a wavelet approach that allows us to disentangle the time and frequency domains and to uncover time-varying nonlinear relationships at different frequency levels. Moreover, we adopt partial wavelet coherence (PWC) and eliminate macroeconomic effects on commodity prices. We observe that ENSO is associated with agricultural, food, and raw material commodity prices at lower frequencies of 32–64 and 64–128 months. These results are stronger from 2000 onward, which are not observed using a conventional wavelet method. Our results suggest a recent strong relationship between ENSO and commodity prices, which has important implications for policymakers regarding climate change risk.",2022-05-16,
Does clean energy matter? Revisiting the spillovers between energy and foreign exchange markets,"Abstract This article highlights the increasingly important role of clean energy metals in return and volatility spillovers across energy and foreign exchange markets. During the collapse of oil prices from 2014 to 2016, crude oil futures were at the center of the risk contagion; however, since the COVID‐19 pandemic broke out, the spillovers of clean energy metal futures have become one of the main sources of the risk contagion. Additionally, crude oil and the US dollar are the most important contributors to the spillovers, but further spillovers are emerging between the Chinese yuan, euro, and Japanese yen with clean energy metals.",2022-05-13,
Comovement and contagion in commodity markets,"This article investigates comovement and contagions in the commodities markets. We examine the comovement by analyzing the unconditional correlation coefficients. We document that commodities tend to partially integrate. We perform contagion tests by identifying coexceedances and estimating multinomial logit to explain the joint occurrence of those coexceedances. We document that commodities price changes tend to affect the probability of both positive and negative coexceedances. Overall, we conclude that there are comovement and contagions among commodities. However, the degrees of comovement and contagion are different among commodities and between positive and negative extreme returns. The contagion among commodities is asymmetric.",2022-04-25,
Global financial crisis versus COVID‐19: Evidence from sentiment analysis,"Abstract This study examines the relationship between sentiment and the realized volatility of returns for different asset classes (stocks, bonds, foreign currency, and commodities). Specifically, we aim to answer two key questions: first, how does sentiment relate to volatility during crises (mainly during the global financial crisis [GFC] and the COVID‐19 pandemic)? Second, can sentiment be used to forecast volatility during crises? Using two nonparametric methods, mutual information and transfer entropy, we find that information sharing and transfer increased during the pandemic. We also find that sentiment information transfer to the volatility of assets differed between the GFC and the COVID‐19 crisis. Since sentiment can reduce uncertainty around the realized variance of assets, we investigate the forecasting ability of sentiment during crises. We find that sentiment has a greater predictive power on realized volatility during crises, with a differential impact on volatility depending on the asset class. Our findings carry important implications for hedging, risk management and building models to predict variance during crises.",2022-04-19,
"Oil and Gas Markets and COVID-19: A Critical Rumination on Drivers, Triggers, and Volatility","The paper endeavours to explore and analyse some critical issues in the oil and gas market that cropped up around the spread of COVID-19 and tries to identify the key drivers and triggers pertaining therewith. The spread of the first wave that began in March 2020 is crucial because of the global economic downturn that ensued due to lockdown and imposed restrictions coupled with a protracted oil price war that began between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The paper tries to address some key research questions to understand the triggers and drivers around the pandemic. These are: (1) whether the behaviour of OPEC or its key players around the pandemic could be considered uniquely different; (2) what could the triggers be for the increased volatilities that cropped up in both physical and financial markets during the pandemic; (3) what was really different about the oil market crisis around the pandemic that transformed it to an unprecedented storage crisis; (4) what really went wrong with the much-hyped U.S. shale boom during the pandemic that led to the bankruptcy of several oil and gas companies, followed by huge job losses. The paper relies on a structured review of relevant secondary literature to address these exploratory questions and builds upon a retrospective rumination on the world oil market from 1960 to 2020. This is complemented by an analysis of supporting data and evidence obtained from various sources. Considering the intertwining of oil and financial markets around the pandemic, the lessons and findings from the paper would not only be highly relevant for policymakers and stakeholders in the oil and gas sector but would be equally relevant for those in the financial markets.",2022-04-14,
Quantifying nonlinear effects of BRIC and G4 liquidity on oil prices,"Abstract Research on oil prices has concentrated on demand and supply factors and has largely underestimated the importance of the financialization of commodities. To assess the impact of financial factors on oil prices, this article investigates the liquidity of Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) and that of a group of four developed economies (G4) consisting of the Eurozone, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. An application of the single-state vector autoregressive (VAR) model to monthly data from the 1999–2020 sample period reveals that a positive shock to the liquidity of the BRIC countries leads to significant increases in real oil prices. These novel findings stem from a consideration of Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MSVAR) models, which shows that an unanticipated increase in the G4 liquidity is positively linked with real oil prices. The main findings are as follows. (1) We identify three regimes that are associated with the volatility of real oil prices and the liquidity measure, including a crisis regime that characterizes the subprime crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Impulse response function analyses show that the impact of G4 liquidity under the crisis regime is almost twice as large as that during normal periods, while the impact of BRIC liquidity during such a crisis period is almost three times larger. (3) A shock to BRIC liquidity has a greater impact on real oil prices than a shock to the liquidity of the G4 economies. This analysis helps in assessing the importance of BRIC and G4 liquidity in relation to upsurges in the real oil prices.",2022-04-13,
The impact of COVID‐19 on the interdependence between US and Chinese oil futures markets,"Abstract The oil futures market plays a vital role in the global financial system, especially after the negative future oil price rose during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This paper investigates the COVID‐19 impact on the interdependence between the US and Chinese oil futures markets by extending the dynamic conditional correlation‐generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC‐GARCH) models with incorporating COVID‐19 variables and by applying vector autoregression (VAR) models. Our study reveals that the COVID‐19 pandemic enhanced the long‐run correlation between the two oil markets. In contrast, daily changes in pandemic severity had a negative effect on the short‐term transient correlation. Our results show that COVID‐19 changed the one‐direction causality from the US oil market to the Chinese market in the pre‐COVID period to a bidirectional causal relation between the two markets during the COVID period. It strengthened the volatility spillover effect from the Chinese to US markets. These findings are helpful to regulars' monitoring oil supply chain risk and investors' cross‐market hedging of spillover risks from a systematic risk perspective.",2022-04-08,
What drives risk in China’s soybean futures market? Evidence from a flexible GARCH-MIDAS model,"Modeling futures market risk simultaneously influenced by macro low-frequency information and daily risk factors is a valuable challenge. We propose a new general framework for it based on the flexible GARCH-MIDAS model. It uses a skewed t distribution to describe the asymmetry of long and short trading positions, allows for a different number of trading days per month, and can identify the optimal combination of risky factors. We also derive its impact response function on how low-frequency factors directly influence the high-frequency futures market risk. Through an exhaustive empirical analysis of the Chinese soybean futures market, we not only find its excellent out-of-sample market risk forecasting performance but also offer systematic recommendations for improving risk management.",2022-04-05,
ESSAYS ON HERDING,"Herding is a feature of investor behavior in financial markets, particularly in market stress.In the thesis we will apply an approach based on the transversal dispersion of individual stock betas, which allows us to extract herd patterns, using two dynamic methodologies to measure the herd phenomenon over time with a state-space model in three different markets.The first study analyzes beta herding in the Brazilian stock market using a statespace model, controlled by two groupings of companies: those stocks listed on the market index (Ibovespa) and those listed on the stock exchange as a whole.The findings revealed a high herd on the Brazilian stock exchange, with only small differences between the clusters.Regarding the control variables, we found that the dividend yield, market volatility, SMB, and WML factors were significant for both groups, indicating that the herd is significant regardless of the behavior of these variables.The second study examines beta herding in the commodity market, using the methodology developed by Hwang and Salmon (2004) and a beta adaptation standardized by Hwang, Rubesam, and Salmon (2018).We analyzed the behavior of fifteen commodities between 2000 and 2018 and then extracted the food commodities to test their effect separately.The results suggest that betas can deviate from fundamentals in both samples.However, food commodity betas tend to revert more quickly to stability between demand and supply, which results in a long-term risk-return balance.The third study applies the methodology of Hwang and Salmon ( 2004) and a beta adaptation standardized by Hwang, Rubesam, and Salmon (2018) for the Cryptocurrency market.The results reveal that the herd towards the market presents significant movement and persistence regardless of the market condition, expressed through the market index, market volatility, and volatility index.When analyzing trail herding, it is possible to observe that herding was intense during the investigated period.We also identified a positive relationship between herding and market stress.",2022-03-25,
Investigating the impact of geopolitical risks on the commodity futures,"This paper examines the effect of real-time global geopolitical risks (GPRs), acts (GPAs), and threats (GPTs) indices on monthly returns and volatility of several American commodity futures. By modeling volatility via an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH), we provide evidence that GPRs and GPTs do not only impact but trigger adverse effects on the returns of crude oil, gold, platinum, and silver, while GPAs negatively affect the returns of crude oil, heating oil, platinum, and sugar futures. Furthermore, GPTs have a weak positive effect on corn futures volatility. Overall, our findings provide portfolio diversification benefits by showing how the impact of global GPRs, GPAs and GPTs on portfolio returns could be mitigated.",2022-03-20,
Order Flows and Financial Investor Impacts in Commodity Futures Markets,"Abstract Using intraday data, we document statistically strong, but temporary, impacts of commodity index trade flows on commodity futures prices. We also examine the previously documented positive returns around the issuance of commodity-linked notes and find that these returns are an order of magnitude too large to be caused by the small trades necessary to hedge the notes. We provide new evidence that they are instead the result of endogenous issuance. Our results provide novel support for commodity financialization but highlight the importance of measuring the magnitude of financial investment, since even large financial flows have economically modest impacts on prices.",2022-02-08,
Commodity hedging benefits: analyses among different financial assets,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the benefits of commodity hedging in the global stock index, bond and foreign currency (FX) portfolios. Design/methodology/approach The authors compare various hedging strategies and factor transaction costs. The authors analyze equally weighted, dynamic hedging ratio, risk parity and reward to risk timing strategies. Volatilities are estimated using historical, GARCH(1,1), and APARCH(1,1) methods. In addition, the authors evaluate the portfolio's hedging performance (HP) based on four different dimensions: volatility (annualized standard deviation), Sharpe ratio (SR), HP, and high-low ratio (HL). Findings The authors observe different benefits of the commodity hedging strategy among financial assets (stocks, bonds or FX).The authors find that commodity hedging in the stock markets is the best option, if the authors optimize the hedging ratio using dynamic hedging from historical data. The authors also document that for stock portfolio managers, adding commodities will generate a more conservative strategy, whereas for bond and/or FX portfolio managers, adding commodities will generate a more aggressive strategy. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by investigating commodity hedging in the global stock index, bond and FX portfolios. First, the authors provide details on the diversification benefits in the commodities. Second, the authors document the hedging strategy that is the best as a part of the diversification strategy by adding commodities. Third, the authors provide a practical analysis by reporting the financial assets portfolio that is appropriate for commodity hedging following the portfolio managers' objectives (e.g. reducing risks or improving the risk-reward ratio).",2022-02-03,
Financialisation of Commodity Markets: Evidence from India,"The known circumstances that favour financialisation of commodity markets which result in unidirectional co-movement of equity and commodity indices are either weak or non-existent in India. Yet, after 2015, there has been a greater correlation between equity and commodity markets even when decoupling is observed in global markets. Results from the rolling regression attest to the shift in response of commodity and equity indices to wholesale price inflation (WPI) and call rate after 2015, indicating that post 2015 co-movement could have been a result of inflation targeting regime. The linear regression as well as the Granger causality analysis based on vector autoregression (VAR) framework, which accounts for simultaneity, confirms that commodity markets are moving on its own supply-demand factors. The rolling regression also brings to light the disciplining effect of regulatory scrutiny and audit trail in the Indian commodity market around July 2013, when National Spot Exchange Ltd. (NSEL) payment crisis and commodity transaction taxes (CTT) occurred. JEL Classifications: G180, G28, C580, G1, G100. G130",2022-02-01,
Exploring the transmission mechanism of speculative and inventory arbitrage activity to commodity price volatility. Novel evidence for the US economy,"In the realm of monetary policy, we explore the transmission mechanism that relates speculative activity, inventory arbitrage activity, and commodity price volatility. In this direction, an ARMA-GARCH model is adopted to test this transmission effect on seven commodities using weekly U.S. data for the period 2008:12 to 2018:6. The results suggest that inventory arbitrage activities transmit monetary policy's effect onto commodities by strengthening the effect of the real interest rate on commodities' prices; in the case of palladium and crude oil's price conditional variances however the opposite effect is established. Speculative activities transmit monetary policy's effect mainly on commodities by increasing the positive effect of the real interest rate on metals and crude oil's prices, and on palladium and crude oil's price conditional variances. Our results show that inventory arbitrage activities are negatively related with commodities' prices, whilst speculative activities are positively related with commodities' prices. The two activities appear to exert mixed effects on commodities' price conditional volatilities. Additional evidence indicates that the relationship between the real interest rate and commodities' prices is positive and significant when unconventional monetary policy is considered, whilst we find that the real interest rate does not have any significant impact on most commodities' price conditional volatilities.",2022-01-14,
Energy Security in Danger? A Comparative Analysis of Oil and Copper Supply,"This study aims to examine energy security in terms of crude oil and copper supply. While oil remains the leading energy commodity globally, copper is crucial for many new technologies, foremost for RES. Therefore, both oil and copper are extremely important for current and future energy security. This article contains a bivariate methodological approach to a comparative analysis of oil and copper supply: determining supply security with an Index of security of supply, and examines price stability with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models. This research provides evidence that there are many differences but also significant similarities between these two completely different commodities in terms of both supply security and price stability. Facing the future for RES, significant demand may cause a threat to energy security on a previously unknown scale. Therefore this instability, both supply- and price-related, appears to be the main threat to future energy security.",2022-01-13,
Situated Information Flow between Food Commodity and Regional Equity Markets: An EEMD-Based Transfer Entropy Analysis,"The intrinsic information shared by financial assets provides a means of assessing their mutual linkages. In times of crisis, spillovers and information flow between markets increase, and this drives empirical investigations into the degree of connectedness between financial assets. In the context of commodity markets, empirical evidence about the mutual information shared and its influence on portfolio management is largely unknown. This study examines the situated information between the food commodities (cereals, dairy, food, meat, vegetable oil, and sugar) of the FAO and regional stock markets’ returns. From the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)‐based Rényian transfer entropy analysis employed, we find significant bidirectional information flow between the food commodities and regional equity markets. Our findings divulge that the diversification potentials of food commodities rest in the long term, with sugar being a consistent diversifier across all investment horizons. The investment and policy implications of our findings are further discussed.",2022-01-01,
"Staking, Token Pricing, and Crypto Carry","The phenomenal rise of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance have prominently featured ``staking'': Besides offering a convenience yield for transactions as digital media of exchange, tokens are frequently staked (and slashed) for base-layer consensus generation or for incentivizing economic activities and platform development, and consequently earn stakers rewards in the same tokens. To provide insights into the economics of staking and its asset pricing implications, we build a continuous-time model of a token-based economy where agents heterogeneous in wealth dynamically solve their wealth allocation (stake-transact-consume) problems. We cast the interactions as a mean field game with stochastic control and systematic shocks, which underscores aggregate staking ratio as a key variable linking staking to token pricing and equilibrium reward rate. Empirical findings on all major stakable tokens corroborate the model predictions. In particular, staking ratio has a positive correlation with reward rates in the cross section and has a negative correlation in the time series. Higher reward rates attract greater future staking, increasing an individuals' staking allocation and the staking ratio in aggregate, which in turn predicts positive excess returns. Finally, we use transaction convenience to rationalize violations of the uncovered interest rate parity and significant carry premia (e.g., a long-short carry yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.6) in the cryptocurrency data.",2022-01-01,
Common Drivers of Commodity Futures?,"We study potential drivers for a large cross-section of commodity futures. Unlike previous studies, we examine the effect of monthly drivers on daily returns using mixed-frequency Granger causality tests. We find real economic activity as a main driver on a monthly basis, whereas financial variables seem to affect returns at daily frequency. The linkages are time-varying for various stages of the financialization of commodity markets with an overall dissipating impact in the recent period of de-financialization. As our results strongly differ from traditional low-frequency Granger causality tests under the temporal aggregation of futures returns, we show the economic value of accessing information at a higher frequency in an out-of-sample trading study. Our findings emphasize the importance of using mixed-frequency techniques to uncover relationships between monthly-published macroeconomic variables and commodity prices.",2022-01-01,
Currency and commodity return relationship under extreme geopolitical risks: Evidence from the invasion of Ukraine,"We examine the relationship between currency and commodity returns around the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. We find that the expected positive contemporaneous relationship between currency and commodity returns reverses and becomes negative during this period of extreme geopolitical risks. In addition to commodity returns, currency returns around the invasion of Ukraine are significantly affected by geopolitical factors, particularly geographic distance to the war. Our results indicate that a war between two major commodity-exporting countries significantly affects global currency pricing.",2022-01-01,
Time-Varying Return Predictability and Adaptive Behavior in The U.S. Commodity Markets During COVID-19,"The study investigates the time-varying efficiency of the four most commonly traded international commodities from the U.S. Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) over a more extended period as well as during COVID-19. The study also explores how adaptive behavior of returns induces profitable opportunities in the commodity markets. Daily returns of commodity indices (gold, silver, oil, metal) are divided into subsamples of six years, to apply a battery of linear/nonlinear tests. The study uncovers the linear and nonlinear serial dependence in returns from commodities and finds evidence of time-varying volatility, thus consistent with the Adaptive Market Hypothesis over the full sample period. Moreover, returns from all the commodities are highly volatile and predictable during COVID-19.",2022-01-01,
Oil Price Assumptions for Macroeconomic Policy,"We evaluate the economic usefulness of oil price forecasts by means of conditional forecasting of five US macroeconomic indicators. First, we forecast oil prices using a mixed sampling frequency framework, where oil prices are driven by information available at high-frequency; and subsequently we proceed with our macroeconomic conditional forecasts. Overall, there is diminishing importance of oil price forecasts for inflation projections, whereas the reverse holds true for inflation expectations, industrial production and producers price index. An array of arguments is presented as to why this might be the case. Our findings remain robust to alternative forecasting frameworks and model specifications.",2022-01-01,
Empirical Evidence of Associations and Similarities between the National Equity Markets Indexes and Crude Oil Prices in the International Market,"The stock market is a major component of the financial sector of any economy and it is particularly affected by crude oil price. Moreover, the financialization of the oil market in the last three decades increased its association with the financial markets. The main purpose of this paper is to uncover similarities among the economy of selected countries based on the association between their national stock markets and crude oil price. This is achieved by time series clustering of the conditional correlations between the national stock market index returns and crude oil price returns estimated from bivariate GARCH models. The clusters do not lead to a clear classification concerning the countries' stage of development, emerging and developed, or the geographical region which can be explained by crude oil market financialization.",2022-01-01,
Does the Financialization of Agriculture Exist in China? Evidence from Sugar Industry,"Financialization refers to the growing importance of finance, financial markets, and financial institutions to the functioning of the economy.This paper thus examines the consequences of agricultural financialization in the Chinese sugar market.We use monthly data from January 2006 to June 2019 to build a series of econometric models to identify internal and external shocks and their transfer regimes through impulse response analysis, variance decomposition, and Granger causality test derived from a structural vector autoregression model.We conclude that the phenomenon of agricultural financialization does not exist in the Chinese sugar market.",2022-01-01,
"Closing Pressure, Predatory Trading, and the Negative Price of Oil","This paper examines the contribution of closing pressure and predatory trading to the formation of the negative settlement price of NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil futures on April 20, 2020. We construct a theoretical model and show that the eagerness to close long positions, namely, the closing pressure, pushes down the WTI price. Empirical tests confirm this negative price effect of closing pressure, but it is estimated to bring the price down to only approximately 3 dollars. An extended model with the Trading at Settlement (TAS) market further suggests that predatory trading greatly drags down the daily settlement price, and the price is simulated to be lower than –30 dollars. Overall, closing pressure and predatory trading together contribute to the negative price of oil.",2022-01-01,
Measuring Financial Investor Presence through Term Structure Deflection,We estimate the presence of financial investors in commodity futures markets from deflections in the term structure. We argue that large-scale inflows from financial investors cause systematic deviations in nearby futures contracts that reflect excessive buying pressure in commodities. We compare this new speculation indicator to popular existing measures including reported CFTC data and the Hamilton and Wu (2014) risk premium. We find substantial financial investor presence in commodity markets from 2004 to 2014. We show that our new speculation measure is better at explaining the variation in crude oil volatility than other existing measures.,2022-01-01,
Trading Strategies and Return Patterns in Commodity Futures Markets,"This thesis analyzes commodity futures pricing, trading activities in commodity futures contracts and their use for investment strategies. The aim of this thesis is to fill important gaps in the research field of commodity markets and to highlight special characteristics of commodity futures. It consists of three main chapters which are based on three research papers. The first paper Smart Beta Strategies on Commodity Futures Markets analyzes the use of commodity futures for passive long-only factor investment strategies. It builds on the idea of using factor investment strategies, sometimes also called smart beta strategies, in the space of commodity futures markets. This paper identifies and analyzes eight different types of smart beta strategies, including equal-weight, low-volatility, momentum and term-structure strategies. Term structure strategies can provide an excess return of up to 25% p.a. in the sample-period and prove to be a very attractive investment strategy. These results also cannot be explained by known equity or bond risk-factors. These results highlight the possible information content of the term structure of futures prices and also provide the idea for the second research paper. The second paper A Factor Decomposition of Term Premiums in Commodity Futures Markets examines the term structure of expected commodity futures returns on a theoretical and empirical basis. We use a 3-factor model, which is based on the Cortazar N-factor model, to decompose commodity futures term premiums into a constant, a linear and a non-linear function for the time to expiry. We show that commodity futures returns for maturities of one month and up to twelve months are well explained by this model. Furthermore the information of this model can also be used for profitable long-short trading strategies with Sharpe ratios up to 0.93. The third paper Short Term Commodity Futures Contracts: Trading Patterns and Returns analyzes the specific behaviour of commodity futures in the last trading months, when trading activity is possibly influenced by the physical delivery process. The physical delivery process is usually avoided by financial investors. In our study we analyze trading patterns in volume, open interest and futures returns based on differences in the timing of the physical delivery process for different commodities. We find that the notice day presents an important turning point for every commodity futures contract, when the contract turns from an actively traded contract to a very illiquid contract. Furthermore, we also show that long investors who are willing to run the risk of physical delivery can earn a risk premium during the notice period.",2022-01-01,
Energy and Metal Price Uncertainties and the Global Economy,"A novel measure of two classes of monthly commodity price uncertainty is constructed by applying mixed-frequency state-space modelling to forecasts of prices of six energy and fourteen metal commodities. Energy price uncertainty shocks are found to be contractionary for the world economy, while metal price uncertainty shocks are not. Both metal and energy prices decrease following an associated price uncertainty shock, with counterfactual analysis revealing that energy price uncertainty has a mainly direct impact on energy returns while the impact of metal price uncertainty on metal returns is mediated through global financial markets. Global economic activity is a significant driver of both commodity uncertainties, while global financial uncertainty is only important for metal price uncertainty. Our results highlight the differences between metal and energy price uncertainties, both in terms of the driving forces behind them, as well as their economic impact.",2022-01-01,
Commodity Momentum Decomposition,"This study decomposes a momentum factor (MOM) in the commodity futures market. A high-to-price (HTP) factor generates a higher Sharpe ratio than a price-to-high (PTH) factor. We uncover that the profitability mechanisms across three momentum factors are different. The positive returns on MOM and PTH are associated with overconfidence and strong self-attribution. In contrast, HTP is linked to investors’ underreaction and the information diffusion process. Moreover, we find that positive demand shocks raise the return on HTP.",2022-01-01,

Commodity Returns Co-movement and Its Relationship With Uncertainty Shock and the U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate,"This study examines the time-varying effects of uncertainty shocks on the broadbased movement of commodity returns since the early 1990s. We employ a vector autoregression (VAR) augmented dynamic factor model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility (TVP-VAR-DFM-SV) to extract a common factor from 43 commodity returns. We then create interactions with observed variables, including the U.S. short-term interest rate, excess bond premium, global demand indicator, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate. We identify exogenous uncertainty shocks using an external instrumental variable method. We document an increasing contribution of the common factor to commodity returns since the mid-2000s and find that uncertainty shocks decrease commodity returns across the board. While the negative impact is significant during most periods, its magnitude varies substantially over time, tending to grow much stronger during recessions. Interestingly, uncertainty shocks often lead to dollar appreciation, and thus can potentially account for the seemingly negative correlation between commodity returns and the strength of the U.S. dollar.",2022-01-01,
Energy Market Financialization and Its Policy Implications,"This chapter covers the basic conceptual issues of energy market financialization, its background, its development, and its impacts on energy markets. The trend of financialization has clearly brought new aspects to the energy markets in terms of pricing mechanisms and risks, which can have profound impacts on energy sectors. When the traditional driving factors, such as those from the demand and supply sides, mix with financial factors, the standard policy framework in the energy sector needs to be adjusted. Through reviewing the most recent literature and discussing relevant issues, this chapter aims to bring forward a collection of empirical evidence, a broad discussion of impacts, and, more importantly, the general implications for policymakers around the world. Overall, energy market financialization has already made great impacts to the traditional energy-pricing systems and energy risk management frameworks. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and taking financialization into energy policy frameworks have great meanings.",2022-01-01,
"Intermarket Risk Transmission Across Energy, Carbon, and Commodities","This chapter mainly reviews three recent articles that examine the patterns of extreme risk connectedness across leading global energy firms, and the excess return co-movement across commodity markets, from a topological perspective to analyze the risk relationships. Among studies focusing on measuring the level of integration in the energy or commodity markets and the potential impacts of exogenous shocks, these studies explicitly study the risk relationships across firms or markets based on multivariate frameworks and seek to detect the structural vulnerability in a risk spillover network. Beyond identifying the systemically important components, these works recognize the leading driving forces of the information and risk spillovers in the energy or commodity system. The critical role of financial market dynamics, including market volatility and investors' sentiment, is confirmed in terms of affecting risk spillovers and return co-movement on the commodity side. The empirical findings are clearly relevant to policy, as the identification of such a risk-connectedness structure can provide a tool for ex ante risk evaluation to avoid systemic risk contagion and system-wide malfunctioning.",2022-01-01,

Research and application of 3D visualization technology of borehole data based on WebGL,"Geological borehole data is an important data that truly reflects the underground space information. Using borehole data and geological map to display the underground structure in three dimensions can not only realize the visualization of geological data, but also can truly reproduce the spatial distribution of geological units and their mutual relations. Through in-depth research on WebGL technology, combined with virtual reality technology, asynchronous loading of dynamic resources and high-precision 3D geological modeling of multi-source data, this paper develops 3D visualization technology of borehole data based on WebGL. Based on this method, 3D geological modeling of a certain area in Zhejiang province is carried out through borehole data and geological map data, which verifies the practicability and effectiveness of this method. Through this research and application, it has opened up a new way and pointed out a new direction for the 3D visualization display and application of 1.2 million geological borehole data in the physical geological Data Center of Natural Resources.",2021-12-10,
A trend factor in commodity futures markets: Any economic gains from using information over investment horizons?,"Abstract This paper identifies a trend factor that exploits the short‐, intermediate‐, and long‐run moving averages of settlement prices in commodity futures markets. The trend factor generates statistically and economically large returns during the post‐financialization period 2004–2020. It outperforms the well‐known momentum factor by more than nine times the Sharpe ratio and has less downside risk. The trend factor cannot be explained by the existing factor models and is priced cross‐sectionally. Finally, we find that the trend factor is correlated with funding liquidity measured by the TED spread. Overall, the results indicate that there are significant economic gains from using the information on historical prices in commodity futures markets.",2021-12-07,
Forecasting Commodity Prices Using the Term Structure,"The aim of this study is to test the ability of the yield curve on US government bonds to forecast the future evolution in the prices of commodities often used in as raw materials. We consider the monthly prices of nine commodities for more than 30 years. Our findings, confirmed by several parametric and non-parametric tests, are robust and indicate that the ability to forecast future performance changes over time. Specifically, between 1986 and the early 2000s the yield curve was quite successful in forecasting monthly changes in commodity prices, but that success diminished in the period following. One possible explanation for this outcome is the increased flow of capital into the commodity market resulting in stronger correlations with the equity markets and a breakdown of the obvious relationship between commodities and business cycle. Our findings are important for asset pricing, commodity traders and policy makers.",2021-12-04,
The Essence of Relationships between the Crude Oil Market and Foreign Currencies Market Based on a Study of Key Currencies,"Structural changes occurring in the crude oil market have stimulated the emergence of hypotheses suggesting that the relationship between prices of this raw material and the US dollar exchange rate can gradually become similar to that observed between oil prices and exchange rates of the currencies of the countries whose revenues from the export of this resource are a significant part of their current account balance. The purpose of this study was to determine and evaluate the time-varying dependence between oil prices and the exchange rate of the US dollar in the context of the same relationship for the Chinese, European, Japanese, Saudi, and Russian currencies. The results of our analyses implicate that a negative correlation between the variables in question grows stronger in time periods preceding global shocks and during thereof. The dominance of the USD in the crude oil market is reflected in similar characteristics of the correlations of the currencies of other countries, such as China, countries of the Euro area, or Japan. As for countries exporting crude oil, the situation varies. The results of our research suggest the lack of a stable relationships between prices of crude oil and currency exchange rates. It is also impossible to observe a long-term, unequivocal tendency of the currencies of oil exporting countries being positively correlated with oil prices. Russia was the closest to this situation. In Saudi Arabia, a positive correlation emerged during moments of crisis.",2021-11-29,
Common factors of commodity prices,"Summary In this paper, we extract latent factors from a large cross‐section of commodity prices, including fuel and non‐fuel commodities. We decompose each commodity price series into a global (or common) component, block‐specific components, and a purely idiosyncratic component. We find that the bulk of the fluctuations in commodity prices are well summarized by a single global factor. This global factor is closely related to fluctuations in global economic activity and, since the early 2000s, has become more important in explaining variations in commodity prices.",2021-10-28,
The interplay between oil and food commodity prices: Has it changed over time?,"Using a structural time-varying-parameter Bayesian vector autoregression (TVP-BVAR) framework, this paper documents that oil price increases caused by oil supply disruptions did not affect food commodity prices before the start of the millennium, but had positive spillover effects in more recent periods and particularly in the era around the Great Recession. Likewise, shortfalls in global food commodity supply resulting from bad harvests have positive effects on crude oil prices since the early 2000s, in contrast to the preceding era. The econometric evidence suggests that these developments are not the consequence of the popular biofuels narrative and more likely the result of informational frictions about the global business cycle and information discovery in financialized commodity markets.",2021-10-27,
Anomalies in Commodity Futures Markets,"In recent years, commodity markets have become increasingly popular among financial investors. While previous studies document a factor structure, not much is known about how prominent anomalies are priced in commodity futures markets. We examine a large set of such anomaly variables. We identify sizable premia for jump risk, momentum, skewness, and volatility-of-volatility. Other prominent variables, such as downside beta, idiosyncratic volatility, and MAX, are not priced in commodity futures markets. Commodity investors should rebalance their portfolios regularly. Returns for annual holding periods are substantially weaker than for monthly rebalancing.",2021-10-06,
Contagions in interconnected power markets,"Purpose This paper offers an alternative approach to assessing contagions in price and load in the Australian interconnected power markets. This approach enabled us to identify a high-risk region and assess the direction of contagions from both buyers' and sellers' perspectives. Design/methodology/approach The author used a multinomial logit method to measure contagions. Having identified the exceedance and coexceedances, the author estimated the multinomial logit coefficients of the covariates explaining the probability of a certain number of coexceedances. Findings Market participants should recognize the presence of contagion risk and scrutinize price and load dynamics in the NSW and VIC regions to anticipate any simultaneous extreme changes. Regulators need to stabilize the demand and supply sides in those regions to minimize any possible contagions. Originality/value This paper presents a pioneering study investigating contagion in the Australian interconnected power markets.",2021-10-04,
"Financialization, common stochastic trends, and commodity prices","Abstract Commodity financialization has been a subject of discussion since the 2008 financial crisis. It is estimated that between 2003 and 2008, index investorsʼ positions increased from $13 billion to $317 billion. Surprisingly, most studies, predominantly based on Granger‐causality testing, find no relationship between financialization and commodity prices. We examine the effects of shocks to the common stochastic trends in the index positions, the spot and futures prices of Chicago corn and soybeans, WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas. The results show that financialization has contributed to the price movements of these commodities.",2021-09-27,
Socially Responsible Funds and Traditional Energy Commodities: A Diversification Perspective for Investments,"Our work examines the relationship between socially responsible funds and the traditional energy market over daily returns data ranging from December 2015 to April 2019. We apply quantile cross-spectral analysis to measure returns correlation under different market conditions in the short, medium, and long run to measure the connectedness between both markets. Our results highlight that correlation based on different quantile distributions yields different investment opportunities. In the short run, investors can benefit from diversifying assets under extreme market conditions. No significant diversification opportunities are available in the medium- and long-run periods. Our findings provide implications for individual investors making investments under different horizons and dynamic market conditions.",2021-09-24,

Network analysis of corn cash price comovements,"Commodity price comovements are an important issue in economics given their significant implications for food and resource sectors that directly influence social well-being. This study approaches this issue by focusing on daily cash prices of 182 corn markets from the seven largest harvest states in the United States for 2006–2011 by using correlation based hierarchical analysis and synchronization analysis, through which we can determine interactions and interdependence among these prices, heterogeneities in price synchronization, and their changing patterns over time. As the first study of the issue concentrating on prices of hundreds of spatially dispersed markets for a commodity of indubitable economic significance, empirical findings show that the degree of comovements is generally higher after November 2006 but no persistent increase is observed. Different groups of markets are identified, each of which has its members exhibit similar price dynamics. Certain markets show potential of serving as price leaders. Results here benefit food and resource policy analysis and design for economic welfare. The empirical framework has potential of being adapted to network analysis of prices of different commodities.",2021-08-26,
Measurement errors in index trader positions data: Is the price pressure hypothesis still invalid?,"Abstract In this paper, we examine whether the repeated rejection of Masters's price pressure hypothesis is robust with respect to measurement errors in index trader positions data. We allow for autocorrelated errors and a potential impact of index trader positions on both the level and volatility of commodity returns. The resulting state‐space model is estimated via particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC). The empirical investigation relies on weekly data for 12 commodities listed in the SCoT and DCoT reports from 2006 to 2020. Our empirical findings show that the rejection of the price pressure hypothesis is robust concerning the inclusion of measurement errors in index trader positions data.",2021-08-16,
Financial investments and commodity prices,"Abstract In this paper, we show that financial investments dilute the relationship between convenience yields (a proxy for fundamentals) and commodity prices. On average, the explanatory power of convenience yields on the movements of commodity prices decreased from 63% to 33% after 2004, when institutional investors rapidly started building their positions in commodity futures. We develop a model of the commodity market with financial investments and test the model predictions using futures prices of 21 US‐traded commodities and index traders' positions on 12 agricultural commodities. Because of correlated financial demands for different commodity futures, we identify comovements in spot prices for fundamentally independent commodities.",2021-08-10,
"Causal Nexus Between Crude, Gold, Dollar and Stock Markets in India: Empirical Explorations Before, During and After the Global Recession","This research study empirically examines the price linkages among oil, dollar, gold and stock markets in India over period from 1999:1 to 2019:12. We employ cointegrated vector error correction model (VECM) and Granger causality test to study the long-run and short-run relationships between commodity and financial markets before, during and after the global financial crisis. Our analysis finds the dependency on price movements in asset markets is time-varying and countercyclical in India. Findings suggest the asymmetric structure of price correlations among asset markets across three temporal periods on either side of the crisis. Our study offers useful insights into the strategic asset allocations to investors in response to economic cycles, to help optimise potential portfolio returns and provide protection towards some downside risks.

Booms in Agricultural &amp; Non-Agricultural Prices: Who Is Responsible?,"This paper investigates the cross-market price linkages in actively traded, major agricultural and energy commodities, impacted by three global episodes over the 1971-2018 time frame. As episodes, we identify the rapid increase of prices during the 1970’s, the commodity depression of the 1990’s, the credit crunch and sovereign debt crisis in the 2000’s. We find that during the rapid price increase in 1970’s, all the major agricultural commodity are influenced by a series of events, including the Soviet Union’s unexpected purchase of a large amount of grain in the global markets. During the commodity depression, a negative relationship is shown by all the agricultural commodities. The credit crunch and sovereign debt shows a positive impact for only wheat whereas oats show a negative relationship. We also investigate these three episodes on non-agricultural commodity sectors (wood and animal, precious metal and energy sector). The paper demonstrates the increase in the energy prices supporting the cross-market linkages between the stock and crude oil markets as a result of the financialization of commodities.",2021-08-04,
"Financialization of the Minerals and Metals Market: Origin, Challenges and Prospects","The theme of the financialization of commodity markets generated a large scientific literature during the 2000s. Financialization is assimilated to financial speculation or to a particular form of it. Regardless of the product in question, a raw materials chain involves producers, processors, and users, as well as physical traders whose economic function is to reconcile these same producers and users in time and space. The essential question which arises is that of the reasons explaining this heterogeneity among metals and minerals and, therefore, that of legitimizing the emergence and then the perpetuation of such a derivative market within a raw materials sector. The dynamics of financialization can be understood as the abandonment of historical producer price systems in favor of a system where market prices prevail. The financialization of commodity markets is a research topic that is most often part of a vast corpus of research aimed at better understanding the dynamics of their prices.",2021-08-02,
Impact of commodity price volatility on external debt: the role of exchange rate regimes,"This study explores the impact of commodity price volatility on external debt accumulation under fixed, managed, and floating exchange rate regimes. We estimate dynamic panel data models for 97 countries from 1993 to 2016. Our empirical findings show that commodity price volatility increases external debt accumulation for commodity-exporting countries. This impact is three-times higher for countries with fixed exchange rate regimes compared to managed floating exchange rate regimes. Under floating exchange regimes, the effect of commodity price volatility on external debt is statistically insignificant. Our results suggest that the adoption of a floating exchange rate regime by commodity-exporting countries is critical to mitigate the effects of commodity price volatility on external debt accumulation.",2021-07-20,

Asymmetry of Risk Evolution in Crude Oil Market: From the Perspective of Dual Attributes of Oil,"Investor emotional heterogeneity and oil dual attributes are the key factors that cause the asymmetry of risks in the international crude oil market. This paper uses the monthly data from April 2003 to October 2020 to identify the dynamic characteristics of oil’s commodity attribute and financial attribute, and this paper also analyzes the asymmetric characteristics of risk evolution and risk degree in the international crude oil market under the condition of oil returns heterogeneity. The empirical results show that: first, there is heterogeneity in the influence of oil attributes on the risk evolution and risk degree of the international crude oil market; second, the alternation of oil dual attributes has a significant asymmetric impact on the risk evolution of international crude oil market; third, the sudden change of international crude oil market risk caused by oil attributes is asymmetric under different oil returns trends. Based on the empirical conclusion, this paper puts forward the corresponding policy recommendations.",2021-07-05,

Dynamic Characteristics of Oil Attributes and Their Market Effects,"The commercial and financial attributes of oil have significantly changed the evolution characteristics of prices and returns of the international crude oil market. Using monthly data from April 2003 to October 2020, this paper identifies dynamic characteristics of oil’s commercial and financial attributes based on the structural vector autoregressive model (SVAR) and further analyzes their market effects with different attributes. The result shows that there are situations of commercial and financial attributes dominating, and dual attributes co-dominating for oil. Furthermore, their durations account for 51%, 23%, and 26% respectively, of the full sample. Besides, the reactions of crude oil price or return to the different properties of oil are heterogeneous. Specifically, the dual attributes of oil play the most important role in the price evolution of the international crude oil market, which is 80.851. There are significant differences among the impact of different attributes of oil on the evolution of international crude oil market returns, which are 0.009, −0.008, and −0.004, respectively. Then, some relevant recommendations for policy-makers and investors based on the above research conclusions are also put forward.",2021-06-30,
Have institutional investors stocks portfolio strategies affected oil prices in a financialization context?,Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether management strategies implemented by non-commercial traders may be identified as a key factor in affecting oil price paths in the conventional pre- and post-financialization periods. Design/methodology/approach By using a vector autoregressive approach the dynamic analysis of the daily stock indexes for some of the most important world economies and the oil prices is conducted starting from 1992 to the end of 2020. Findings The findings do not support the idea that the financial markets act as a privileged conduit in transmitting the shocks to the oil spot quotations. Originality/value Such a direct assessment has not been previously proposed in literature wherein – under a financial perspective – the returns are generally taken into consideration.,2021-06-23,
Forecasting WTI crude oil futures returns: Does the term structure help?,"Nelson-Siegel (NS) factors extracted from the term structure of WTI oil futures are shown to predict subsequent WTI holding period returns in-sample. This in-sample predictability is not diminished by augmenting with macroeconomic indicators or oil market specific predictors. Allowing the decay factor in the Nelson-Siegel model to vary over time improves in-sample predictions at medium horizon return forecasts. We conduct out-of-sample forecasting exercises on models that use NS factors, such as a simple two factor model that uses a composite leading indicator along with the NS decay factor, and a LASSO model that combines NS factors with macroeconomic indicators and oil market specific predictors. These models significantly reduce forecast errors relative to a no change benchmark across a range of return horizons and futures contract maturities. We also find consistent evidence that models that use the NS factors result in trading strategies with higher Sharpe ratios and better skewness properties than buy and hold strategies and historical mean strategies.",2021-06-07,
Stationarity in the Prices of Energy Commodities. A Nonparametric Approach,"In this paper, we address the classical problem of testing for stationarity in the prices of energy-related commodities. A panel of fourteen time series of monthly prices is analyzed for the 1980–2020 period. Nine of the series are classical nonrenewable, GHG-emissions-intensive resources (coal, crude oil, natural gas), whereas the remaining, low-emission group includes both uranium and four commodities employed in biofuels (rapeseed, palm, and soybean oils, and ethanol). A nonparametric, bootstrap-based stationarity testing framework is employed. The main advantage of this procedure is its asymptotically model-free nature, being less sensitive than parametric tests to the risks of misspecification and detection of spurious unit roots, although it has the potential limitation of typically requiring larger samples than mainstream tools. Results suggest that most of the series analyzed may be trend stationary. The only exception would be crude oil, where different conclusions are obtained depending on whether a seasonal correction is applied or not.",2021-06-05,
The dynamics of commodity return comovements,"Abstract We compare factor models with respect to their ability to explain commodity futures return comovements. A simple one‐factor model based on the first principal component extracted from a panel of commodity returns outperforms a macroeconomic model, and explains most of the realized comovements. We find that intersectoral correlations display more time variations than intrasectoral correlations. Dissecting the evidence further, we find that comovements are driven by the variation of the factor as opposed to exposure to it. Our results cast doubt on the persistence of the effects of financialization and emphasize the importance of the dynamics of the factor variance.",2021-06-02,
How trading in commodity futures option markets impacts commodity futures prices,"Abstract This paper investigates the information content of the futures option markets trading activities in determining commodity futures returns. Our findings suggest that position changes in the commodity futures option markets provide incremental predictive power for commodity futures returns in addition to the effects of commodity futures markets position changes. Particularly, for both commercial traders and noncommercial traders, options position changes impact the futures price in the same direction as futures position changes. Furthermore, the nonmomentum of position changes of options market contributes overwhelmingly relative to the idiosyncratic risk and hedging pressure in the case of noncommercial trading.",2021-05-26,
"Food Prices, Ethics and Forms of Speculation","This paper examines the role of speculative motives in the determination of commodity prices and specifically food related commodity prices. The motivation for this study is the considerable flow of funds into commodities, the widespread view that the process of financialization has led to greater levels of speculation and that speculation is the primary cause of regular spikes in food prices since the turn of the century. We consider two forms of short-term trading, a biasing influence (Manipulators) and a correcting influence (Speculators), relative to the fundamental price. While both forms of short-term trading are relevant, they are small in terms of their influence on overall prices. We do however find some evidence of an increased role being played by Manipulators during the period most associated with financialization.",2021-05-23,
Time-varying window length for correlation forecasts,"Forecasting correlations between stocks and commodities is important for diversification across asset classes and other risk management decisions. Correlation forecasts are affected by model uncertainty, the sources of which can include uncertainty about changing fundamentals and associated parameters (model instability), structural breaks and nonlinearities due, for example, to regime switching. We use approaches that weight historical data according to their predictive content. Specifically, we estimate two alternative models, ‘time-varying weights’ and ‘time-varying window’, in order to maximize the value of past data for forecasting. Our empirical analyses reveal that these approaches provide superior forecasts to several benchmark models for forecasting correlations. Keywords: model uncertainty; variance and correlation forecasts; time-varying window length",2021-05-21,

A Time-Varying Gerber Statistic: Application of a Novel Correlation Metric to Commodity Price Co-Movements,"This study investigates the daily co-movements in commodity prices over the period 2006–2020 using a novel approach based on a time-varying Gerber correlation. The statistic is computed considering a set of probabilities estimated via non-traditional models that give a time-varying structure to the measure. The results indicate that there are several co-movements across commodities, that these co-movements change over time, and that they are tendentially positive. Conditional auto-regressive multithreshold logit models show higher forecasting accuracy for agricultural returns, while dynamic conditional correlation models are more accurate for energy products and metals. The proposed models are shown to be superior in terms of forecasting power to the benchmark method which is based on estimating the Gerber correlation moving a rolling window.",2021-05-16,
Risk Spillover during the COVID-19 Global Pandemic and Portfolio Management,"This paper aims to examine the volatility spillover, diversification benefits, and hedge ratios between U.S. stock markets and different financial variables and commodities during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 crisis, using daily data and multivariate GARCH models. Our results indicate that the risk spillover has reached the highest level during the COVID-19 period, compared to the pre-COVID period, which means that the COVID-19 pandemic enforced the risk spillover between U.S. stock markets and the remains assets. We confirm the economic benefit of diversification in both tranquil and crisis periods (e.g., a negative dynamic conditional correlation between the VIX and SP500). Moreover, the hedging analysis exhibits that the Dow Jones Islamic has the highest hedging effectiveness either before or during the recent COVID19 crisis, offering better resistance to uncertainty caused by unpredictable turmoil such as the COVID19 outbreak. Our finding may have some implications for portfolio managers and investors to reduce their exposure to the risk in their portfolio construction.",2021-05-14,
Analyzing the frequency dynamics of volatility spillovers across precious and industrial metal markets,"Abstract This paper investigates the volatility spillovers across precious and industrial metal markets over the period 1993–2019 based on the DY and ​BK methods. Results are summarized as follows: (1) while volatility spillovers across industrial metals are higher than across precious metals, the opposite occurs during crisis periods where precious metals cause net volatility spillovers to industrial metals; (2) volatility spillovers of the two metal groups show different dynamics in the short‐, medium‐ and long‐term components, especially in the short‐ and medium‐term components.",2021-05-14,
Reconceptualizing contemporary energy markets,"This article provides a conjunctural synopsis of both empirical trends and new approaches to analytically and normatively assessing energy markets. The preceding eras of coal and oil entailed not only differing technologies but also historically distinct political geographies, modes of production, and characteristic commodities and systems of value. They also coincided with and helped reinforce several misleading assumptions: of ‘pure’, ‘stateless’ energy markets; of scarcity as a defining feature of all economies; of unlimited growth and of market equilibrium. These assumptions tended to reinforce established approaches to energy markets that were insufficiently historically grounded, abstracted from social, political and ecological relations, and – with particular reference to oil – premised on zero-sum geostrategic calculations of interest. They are inadequate to, or misleading about, fossil fuel markets, and do not adequately address such recent phenomena as unprecedented levels of financialization of the global economy with an unprecedented intensity of ecological crisis entailing, most prominently, global warming. These factors undermine the prior assumptions in several respects: it is not scarcity, but rather abundance of greenhouse gas emissions that is of paramount concern; this in turn necessarily implies that unlimited growth is neither possible nor desirable; and furthermore, that ecological degradation has fundamentally displaced the analytical plausibility of market equilibrium, no less than its normative appeal. An exercise in reconceptualizing energy markets is therefore one that should explore not only what was misperceived and what has changed but also what needs to change in order to restore economic, political and ecological sustainability.",2021-05-14,
Does the risk aversion of crude oil market investors have directional predictability for the precious metal and agricultural markets?,"Purpose Risk aversion is considered as an important factor in predicting asset prices. Many studies have proved that there exists important price information spillover among crude oil, precious metals and agricultural markets. Then there naturally follows the question: Is the risk aversion of investors in crude oil market predictable for the returns of precious metals and agricultural products? The purpose of this paper is to answer this question. For this reason, the authors explore the directional predictability and the cross-quantile dependence between risk aversion of crude oil market investors and returns of precious metals and agricultural products. Design/methodology/approach To better describe the risk aversion of investors, this paper uses high-frequency data and model-free calculation method to obtain variance risk premium of crude oil. Then, this paper uses the cross-quantilogram method to investigate the directional predictability and cross-quantile dependence between risk aversion of crude oil market investors and returns of precious metals and agricultural products. Meanwhile, it employs the partial cross-quantilogram (PCQ) method to test the impact of control variables on the empirical results. Findings Firstly, risk aversion of crude oil market investors has directional predictability for returns of precious metals and agricultural products. Secondly, different degrees of risk aversion of crude oil market investors have different impacts on returns of precious metals and agricultural products. A low (high) degree of crude oil market investors' risk aversion has negative (positive) predictability for returns of precious metals and agricultural products. Finally, during the sample period, the returns of precious metals are more affected by risk aversion of crude oil market investors than returns of agricultural products. Originality/value First of all, this paper studies the impact of risk aversion of crude oil market investors on returns of precious metals and agricultural products. It updates previous relevant studies on the factors influencing the prices of precious metals and agricultural products, and provides a new idea for the forecast of those commodity returns. Secondly, this paper provides the evidence that different degrees of risk aversion of investors have different effects on the returns of commodities, and expands the research on the topic of commodity returns prediction. Finally, high-frequency data are employed in this paper to better capture the risk aversion of investors than commonly used daily data.",2021-04-28,
Oil Volatility Spillover into Oil Dependent Equity-Sector Stock Returns: Evidence from Major Oil Producing Countries,"In this paper, we study the effects of oil price volatility on the stock market relevant sectors from several oil producing countries.We investigate the interdependence between oil prices and sector stock indices within OPEC markets and selected major non-OPEC countries such as Russia and United States.By exploring the time-varying dynamics of oil prices and sector-stock indices on the sectoral reaction to oil price shocks we investigate how the shocks in oil prices affect the correlation dynamics of the different sectors.Our study finds that different sectors display heterogeneous dynamic correlation pattern with different oil price shocks origins in different countries.Specifically, the GARCH coefficients in several sectors, such as, industrial, energy and healthcare in some of oil-producing middle-eastern countries are not significant.In addition, the negative coefficients for some sectors in some of the countries indicate the existence of hedging opportunities for portfolio managers.",2021-04-28,
"Cryptocurrencies, gold, and WTI crude oil market efficiency: a dynamic analysis based on the adaptive market hypothesis","Abstract This study examined the evolving oil market efficiency by applying daily historical data to the three benchmark cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple), gold, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. The data coverage of daily returns was from August 2015 to April 2019. We applied two alternative tests to examine linear and nonlinear dependency, i.e., automatic portmanteau and generalized spectral tests. The analysis of observed results validated the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) in all markets, but the degree of adaptability between the data was different. In this study, we also analyzed the existence of evolutionary behavior in the market. To achieve this goal, we checked the results by applying the rolling-window method with three different window lengths (50, 100, and 150 days) on the test statistics, which was consistent with the findings of AMH.",2021-04-27,
"Hedging Dow Jones Islamic and conventional emerging market indices with CDS, oil, gold and the VSTOXX: A comparison between DCC, ADCC and GO-GARCH models","Our goal in this paper is to examine the time-varying optimal hedging ratios for the Dow Jones Islamic and conventional emerging stock market indices, hedged with oil, gold, and the VSTOXX as well as four emerging-country sectoral CDS indices (raw materials, industry, health care, and telecommunications). Using a rolling-window procedure with daily data, for the period from January 2000 to April 2019, along with, DCC, ADCC and GO-GARCH models as well as a hedging effectiveness criterion, we determine the best hedging instrument(s). Our findings prove that CDS indices are the best hedging instruments for both Islamic and conventional portfolios, as they have the highest hedging effectiveness. Our empirical results are robust to distribution assumptions and to the use of three MGARCH models in examining different refits (20, 40, and 60 days).",2021-04-20,
Is Futurization the Culprit for the Violent Fluctuation in China’s Apple Spot Price?,"China aims to utilize the futures market to stabilize agricultural product price fluctuation by quantifying the effects of risk transfer and price discovery. However, the role of futurization has been questioned and even posited as the cause of drastic fluctuations in spot market prices. This research aims to clarify the impact of futurization on the price fluctuation of agricultural products and to provide policy reference for the development of the agricultural futures market through the research. Here, we examine the spot price data for apples and use Interrupted time-series analysis (ITSA) and GARCH models to estimate the impact of apple futures on the volatility of spot prices. Our findings demonstrate that the launch of China’s apple futures did not increase the volatility of apple spot prices; that is, futurization was not the cause of skyrocketing apple spot prices. In the long term, our results suggest that futures will help reduce the volatility of apple spot prices and that the introduction of futures will ultimately reduce the price volatility of agricultural products.",2021-04-12,
Determinantes do Investimento Externo Direto: uma análise para o período de crise e bonança das commodities,"O boom de commodities e a crise financeira global exerceram influência elevada sobre a economia mundial no período 2004-2012. Diante deste cenário, a análise fatorial e o estimador de Heckit são utilizados para verificar o modo como esta conjuntura influenciou no fluxo de IED, com base em uma amostra constituída por 21 países emissores de investimento externo direto (IED) e 30 países receptores de IED. Em suma, os resultados encontrados indicam que o boom de commodities resulta no aumento do IED em países com abundância de recursos naturais.

"Oil, Equities, and the Zero Lower Bound","From late 2008 to 2014, oil and equity returns were more positively correlated than in other periods. In addition, we show that both oil and equity returns became more responsive to macroeconomic news. We provide empirical evidence that these changes resulted from the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, consistent with the theoretical predictions of a model that includes the ZLB. Although the ZLB alters the economic environment in theory, supportive empirical evidence has been lacking. Our paper provides clear evidence of the ZLB altering the economic environment.

Multi-scale analysis of influencing factors for soybean futures price risk: Adaptive Fourier decomposition mathematical model applied for the case of China,"Few studies have considered the information in the frequency domain to detect the structural breaks in financial markets. This paper provides a mixed model that integrates BEMD, AFD and Chow test to study the fluctuation characteristics of the soybean futures price. Due to the application of AFD, the mixed model can detect the structural breaks of the price fluctuation through obtaining the high-resolution information in the frequency domain. According to our results, in general, the soybean futures price in China is mainly determined by IMF11, followed by IMF9, IMF8 and IMF7, and there exist many structural breaks of different IMFs. Interestingly, national macro-controls have opposite effects at IMF8 and IMF11. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed mixed model for detecting structural breaks of financial markets in frequency-domain by revealing the impact of external events on the soybean futures price at multi-scales.",2021-03-29,
Energy ETF return jump contagion: a multivariate Hawkes process approach,"Compared with investing in individual stocks, ETF investment is capable of diversifying the non-systematic risk or exposure to broad market or industry sectors. The aim of this paper is to develop a jump contagion modeling framework to understand the contagion effect of market jump events of energy sector ETFs using multivariate Hawkes process modeling approach. Through analyzing intraday high-frequency market data, we find that negative index jumps lead index price discovery processes, and their influences disappear faster than the positive index jumps in both the S&P500 and the crude oil futures. And on average, the self contagion in negative jumps is stronger than the self contagion in the positive jumps across all ETF groups. However, the ETFs focused on the master limited partnership (MLP) segment show less negative self contagion and relatively stronger positive self contagion than the other energy ETFs. Overall, the influence of negative jumps on ETFs from both the equity index and the energy future index is stronger than that of the positive jumps. And the influence of the equity index (S&P500) jump on ETFs lasts longer than that of the crude oil futures index (CLC1).",2021-03-25,
New evidence on commodity stocks,"Abstract This paper investigates whether commodity‐related equities (commodity stocks) should be included in investors' portfolios. In light of the recent financialization of commodity futures markets, it examines the diversification benefits derived from investing in commodity stocks and compares them with those derived from commodity futures. The empirical evidence indicates that over the prefinancialization period, commodity futures provide superior diversification benefits whereas over the postfinancialization period, commodity stock investing is more profitable. Further analysis on the relationship between commodity futures and stock markets reveals that the investor can use price‐based signals from futures markets to achieve high commodity stock returns.",2021-03-13,
Financialisation of commodities – Empirical evidence from the Indian financial market,Financialisation of commodities commenced from the year 2009 with massive inflows of institutional investment. There is mixed evidence as to whether this financialisation of commodities has led to increase in price volatility of the commodities. This study attempts to examine the financialisation of the Indian commodities market by examining the interconnectedness between the Indian commodities market and the Indian stock market in terms of return co-movements and also in terms of volatility spillovers. The analysis indicates a unidirectional causality as well as the existence of volatility spillovers from the stock market to the commodities market.,2021-03-01,
A critique of financial neoliberalism: a perspective combining multidisciplinary methods and commodity markets,"The era of financialization bas been marked by a huge increase in the size of the financial sector. The economic justifications for this expansion arise from the prevailing neo-liberal ideology; they are based on arguments like leading role of markets, economic efficiency, reallocation and spreading of risk. Given these reasons, financialization can be viewed as a form of neoliberalism and then we can use the term financial neoliberalism (Palley in Financialization: the economics of finance capital domination. Springer, 2016) to denote it. This commentary paper hopes to complement this view by highlighting the usefulness of recent ""multidisciplinary"" methods (i.e., methods which do not fall within the usual economic discipline). We focus first on the definition of financialization process, second on its implications on the commodity markets, and third and finally on the importance of the role of multidisciplinary methods, applied to these markets, capable of highlighting the contradictions of the neoliberalism framework, in such a way, we hope, to promote further research.",2021-03-01,
Spillover and Drivers of Uncertainty among Oil and Commodity Markets,"The paper aims to examine the spillover of uncertainty among commodity markets using Diebold–Yilmaz approach based on forecast error variance decomposition. Next, causal impact of global factors as drivers of uncertainty transmission between oil and other commodity markets is analyzed. Our analysis suggests that oil is a net transmitter to other commodity uncertainties, and this transmission significantly increased during the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. The use of linear and nonlinear causality tests indicates that the global factors have a causal effect on the overall connectedness, and especially on the spillovers from oil to other commodity uncertainties. Further segregation of transmissions between oil to individual commodity markets indicates that stock market implied volatility, risk spread, and economic policy uncertainty are the influential drivers of connectedness among commodity markets.",2021-02-23,

FINANCIALIZATION OF COMMODITIES BEFORE AND AFTER THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS,"Abstract More than 12 years after the historical oil price spike, the financialization of commodities and the interaction among different types of commodity investors remain a hot topic. We review the early financialization literature and the main theoretical contributions to understand how market frictions can affect prices and liquidity. We introduce the debate on the de‐financialization and offer insights about the multifaceted role of commercial investors in derivatives markets. Last, we show how other research streams, such as the analysis of the shale industry and of other financial derivatives than futures, might complement the view on the financialization of commodities.",2021-01-15,
Can Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Drive the Interdependence of Agricultural Commodity Prices? Evidence from Partial Wavelet Coherence Analysis,"This paper employed wavelet coherence and partial wavelet coherence to investigate the time‐frequency effect of global economic policy uncertainty on the comovement of five agricultural commodities such as maize, oat, rice, soybean, and wheat using monthly data from January 1997 to December 2019. In general, we observed heterogeneity in comovement structures of the agricultural commodities market at different time‐frequency scales which are profound at high frequencies from the bivariate wavelet coherence. The partial wavelet coherence analysis shows that global economic policy uncertainty is a driver of agricultural commodity market connectedness. This implies that extreme changes in economic policy uncertainty have the tendency to influence commodity price comovement. This poses risk to the stability of the agricultural commodities market, which requires the policymaker’s intervention to protect against the spillover risk contagion effect in uncertain times.",2021-01-01,
The Impact of Geopolitical Risk on Systemic Risk Spillover in Commodity Market: An EMD‐Based Network Topology Approach,"Since the financialization of commodities, portfolio investments have become an important tool for investors to diversify risks. However, due to the nonlinear fluctuations brought about by extreme events, investors face more difficulties in the choice of risk portfolio. We adopt empirical mode decomposition and STVAR model, along with the basis data of optimized original sample interval. In addition, we retain the mature research of multiscale systemic risk under frequency and divide the dimension of systemic risk into two states. When frequency is combined with states, the risk spillover center undergoes subversive changes, particularly in the longest term, and metals become the risk spillover center, substituting the energy commodity, on the condition that the compositions of extreme value add persuasive power to the perspective of long term. We proposed that the joint fluctuation of agricultural commodities and energy commodities makes the former become another important risk spillover point. For investors, holding period and portfolio both need to be considered.",2021-01-01,
Geopolitical Risk and Dynamic Connectedness between Commodity Markets,"In this paper, we use the improved Diebold & Yilmaz method based on TVP-VAR-SV model to analyze dynamic connectedness between energy, precious metal, industrial metal, agriculture and livestock commodity markets. The results show that the energy, industrial metal, and precious metal commodity markets are the information transmitters in commodity markets, and the agriculture and livestock commodity markets play the roles of information receivers. Furthermore, we employ the GARCH-MIDAS model to study the influence of geopolitical risk on the dynamic connectedness between five commodity markets. We find that geopolitical risk, especially geopolitical act risk, significantly affects the overall connectedness of commodity markets. And more notably, the impacts on the net spillover of various commodity markets are different. Geopolitical risk has positive effects on the net spillover of energy, agriculture and livestock commodity markets, and negative effects on precious metal and industrial metal commodity markets.",2021-01-01,
The commodity risk premium and neural networks,"The paper uses linear and nonlinear predictive models to study the linkage between a set of 128 macroeconomic and financial predictors and the risk premium of commodity futures contracts. The linear models use shrinkage methods based on naive averaging or principal components. The nonlinear models use feedforward deep neural networks (DNN) either as stand-alone or in conjunction with a long short-term memory network (LSTM). Out of the four specifications considered, the LSTM-DNN architecture best captures the risk premium, which underscores the need to estimate models that are both nonlinear and recurrent. The superior performance of the LSTM-DNN portfolio persists after accounting for transaction costs or illiquidity and is unrelated to previously-documented commodity risk factors.",2021-01-01,
The Challenges of Oil Investing: Contango and the Financialization of Commodities,"The ability of oil investment vehicles to perfectly track spot oil has always been challenging, however recently many vehicles have underperformed spot oil. We study the behavior of oil futures and exchange-traded products that invest in oil futures to document and understand the source of this tracking error. The primary reason that oil investment vehicles have underperformed spot oil is due to an increase in contango in oil futures markets that we find might be related to investment crowding and the financialization of commodity markets. We show that from 2006 to 2017 oil futures investing underperformed spot oil and the market was in contango most of the time. Proxies for crowding, such as the concentration of major oil investors and changes in assets under management and fund flows of major oil exchange-traded products are associated with contango in the futures markets and the divergence between futures and spot returns. We also provide evidence of an impact of the financialization on oil futures prices.",2021-01-01,
Booms and Busts in the Oil Market: Identifying Speculative Bubbles Using a Continuous-Time Dynamic System,"The sharp changes in oil prices since 2004 featured a nonlinear data‐generating mechanism which displayed bubble‐like behavior. A popular view is that such a salient pattern cannot be explained by shifts in economic fundamentals, but was driven by speculative bubbles as a consequence of the increased financialization of oil future markets. Testing this hypothesis, however, is challenging since the fundamental component of the oil price is unobservable. This paper attempts to isolate the contribution of speculative bubbles and fundamentals to the evolution of oil prices by providing a stylized model of commodity pricing. Motivated by our theoretical model, we adopt a continuous‐time model with a random and time‐varying persistence parameter to empirically investigate the presence of speculative bubbles in daily oil future prices over the period April 1983 to June 2020. We do not find any evidence in favor of speculative bubbles, although we indeed find that oil prices exhibit episodes of unstable behavior after 2004.",2021-01-01,
Co-Movement between Commodity and Equity Markets Revisited - an Application of the Thick Pen Method,"This paper analyses interdependence between the returns of a number of energy andnon-energy commodities on the one hand and equities on the other based on Thick PenTransform (TPT) methods: (i) Thick Pen Measure of Association (TPMA) and (ii) Multi-Thickness Thick Pen Measure of Association (MTTPMA). These metrics can be used tocapture time-varying co-movement and co-movement across different time scales: this facilitatesthe analysis of the short-term and long-term features of the time series using bothstationary/non-stationary data. Among our key findings is that, when considering longtermco-movement, energy index futures show an increase in co-movement with equities sincethe beginning of the financialisation period. There are asymmetric effects in cross-scale comovementbetween various commodities and equities. The weak co-movement between equityand off-index futures, livestock and soybean-based commodities indicates diversification benefitsfor both short-term and long-term investors.",2021-01-01,
A Structural Non-causal VAR Model of the Global Oil Market: the Role of Oil Supply News Shocks,"This paper uses a new empirical strategy to identify oil supply news shocks within a Non-Causal VAR model of standard global oil market variables. These shocks explain most of the movements in oil production over a long but finite time horizon. Our findings highlight the prominent role of expectations in propagating shocks. Negative oil supply news shocks cause abrupt and permanent reactions in global oil production, global economic activity and in oil inventory. However, an oil supply shock has only a limited effect on oil price. Finally, a news shock regarding oil supply shortfalls has macroeconomic consequences, causing a substantial decline in US industrial production.",2021-01-01,

A Trend Factor in Commodity Futures Markets: Any Economic Gains From Using Information Over Investment Horizons?,"This paper identifies a trend factor that exploits the short-, intermediate-, and long-run moving averages of settlement prices in commodity futures markets. The trend factor generates statistically and economically large returns during the post-financialization period 2004-2020. It outperforms the well-known momentum factor by more than nine times the Sharpe ratio and has less downside risk. The trend factor cannot be explained by the existing factor models and is priced cross-sectionally. Finally, we find that the trend factor is correlated with funding liquidity measured by the TED spread. Overall, the results indicate that there are significant economic gains from using the information on historical prices in commodity futures markets.",2021-01-01,
A influência das commodities no Ibovespa: em busca de um modelo preditivo,"In the last 20 years, the Brazilian economy has faced persistent deindustrialization process followed by the ascension of the agricultural business, mainly commodities production, as the main source of the Brazilian economy growth.Additionally, Brazilian commodities, including mineral ones (oil and iron mainly), has become one of the main sources of hard currency due to their dominance on current Brazilian exports.Worldwide stock exchange movements, besides their dependence on the traded companies' financial performances, are sensible to current economic conditions and perspectives of local markets.On a free capital flow environment, stock exchanges with low liquidity and limited traded equities availability, as the Brazilian stock exchange (Bovespa), are more sensitive to international investors behavior.As a result of the growing importance of the commodities in the Brazilian economy, their prices were incorporated among other economic variables on country's economic health assessment and financial market's risk perception.The main objective of this work is to study the volatilities co-movements of the Ibovespa and commodities indexes, through conditional heterocedasticity models (DCC-GARCH), in order to support the development of a prospective robust predictive model for the Brazilian capital market.The results presented by this work strengthen the assumption that commodities prices have significant explanatory power for the Ibovespa movements, mainly on periods of high volatility, due to economic crises or economic expansion where investors confidence ranges from risk aversion to euphoria.",2021-01-01,
Energy Finance,"Defined as a single industrial sector, the global production, distribution and consumption of energy is the world's largest in terms of annual capital investment (US$1.83 trillion in 2019, the last pre-pandemic year with full data available) and the second largest nonfinancial industry in terms of sales revenue ($4.51 trillion). Over 100 million barrels of oil are produced and consumed each day—with 70% being traded across borders--and each of the world's 7.5 billion citizens consumes an average of 3,181 kilowatt-hours/year, though per-capita energy consumption varies enormously and is much higher in rich rather than in poor countries. Properly analyzing the financial economics of the global energy industry requires focusing on the both the physical aspects of production and distribution--how, where, and with what type of fuel energy is produced and consumed--and the capital investment required to support each energy segment. The global energy ""industry"" can be broadly categorized into two main segments: provision of fuels for transportation and production and distribution of electricity for residential and industrial consumption. The fuels sector encompasses the production, processing, and distribution of crude oil and its refined products, mostly gasoline, kerosene (which becomes jet fuel), diesel, gas oil and residual fuel oil. The electric power sector includes four related businesses: generation, transmission, distribution, and supply. The ongoing transformation of the global energy industry is being driven by the twin imperatives of meeting rising demand due to population growth and rising wealth and of addressing climate change through greener energy policies and massive capital investments by corporations and governments. The pathway to de-carbonizing electricity production and distribution by 2050 is fairly straightforward technologically, though doing so will require both scientific innovations (particularly regarding scalable battery storage) and sustained multi-trillion dollar annual investments for the next three decades. Decarbonizing transportation is a far more difficult and expensive proposition, and will require fundamental breakthroughs in multiple technologies, coupled with unusually far-sighted policy action. Extant academic research already provides useful guidance for policy makers in many areas, but far more will be required to help shape the future policy agenda.",2021-01-01,
The Relative Pricing of WTI and Brent Crude Oil Futures: Expectations or Risk Premia?,"This paper studies the spread of Brent-WTI futures prices using a no-arbitrage term structure model with one common and two latent idiosyncratic risk factors. We document more negative risk premia for WTI than for Brent, and the differences are more pronounced at longer maturities. The expectation of future spot price dominates the risk premium in determining the term structure of Brent-WTI futures spread, especially at short maturities. The common risk premia in both markets are negative and similar, while their corresponding idiosyncratic risk premia have opposite signs. The common risk prices of WTI and Brent are generally related to the US crude commercial stock, inflation, economic uncertainty, and hedging pressure; however, idiosyncratic risk prices are more related to their corresponding local production, short rate, and the term structure factors. The variance decomposition indicates that the idiosyncratic factors account for a considerable part at longer forecast horizons in both markets.",2021-01-01,
Diversification benefits of commodity indices versus Islamic stock indices,"The objective of this study is to investigate conditional correlations between the Dow Jones Emerging Market index and commodity indices (i.e., agriculture, energy, industrial metals, livestock, precious metals) and Islamic stock indices (i.e., JKII, KLFTEMSI, MSCI Bahrain, MSCI Kuwait, and MSCI Qatar). Additionally, this paper classifies the properties of assets whether it is a diversifier, a hedger, or a safe-haven assets to the Dow Jones Emerging Market index. The estimation method is the dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) model to estimate the conditional correlations during the period of 2007-2021�which covers the Global financial crisis (GFC) and Covid-19 pandemic. The finding indicates that all commodity and Islamic stock indices serve as a diversifier in general. However, MSCI Bahrain, MSCI Kuwait, and precious metals act as a safe-haven asset�during certain periods of the GFC and Covid-19 crises. Interestingly, KLFTEMSI and JKII present the highest hedging effectiveness over the study period.�",2021-01-01,
The impact of macro economy on the oil price volatility from the perspective of mixing frequency,"Abstract In this paper, GARCH‐MIDAS model is used to study the influence of macro economy, including the levels and volatilities of macroeconomic variables, on the price fluctuations of crude oil market during the period from 1990 to 2018. The results indicate that, for the levels of macroeconomic variables, economic growth, inflation and total export–import volume have significant negative impacts on oil fluctuations. However, exchange rate has a significant positive impact on oil volatility. And short‐run interest rate does not have a significant effect on oil price volatility in most cases. In addition, the responses of oil price volatility to all five macroeconomic fluctuations are significant. More interestingly, the volatilities of economic growth and total import and export reduce oil price fluctuations during the pre‐2004 period, but they increase oil price fluctuations during the post‐2004 period.",2020-12-21,
A influência das commodities no Ibovespa: em busca de um modelo preditivo,"In the last 20 years, the Brazilian economy has faced persistent deindustrialization process followed by the ascension of the agricultural business, mainly commodities production, as the main source of the Brazilian economy growth.Additionally, Brazilian commodities, including mineral ones (oil and iron mainly), has become one of the main sources of hard currency due to their dominance on current Brazilian exports.Worldwide stock exchange movements, besides their dependence on the traded companies' financial performances, are sensible to current economic conditions and perspectives of local markets.On a free capital flow environment, stock exchanges with low liquidity and limited traded equities availability, as the Brazilian stock exchange (Bovespa), are more sensitive to international investors behavior.As a result of the growing importance of the commodities in the Brazilian economy, their prices were incorporated among other economic variables on country's economic health assessment and financial market's risk perception.The main objective of this work is to study the volatilities co-movements of the Ibovespa and commodities indexes, through conditional heterocedasticity models (DCC-GARCH), in order to support the development of a prospective robust predictive model for the Brazilian capital market.The results presented by this work strengthen the assumption that commodities prices have significant explanatory power for the Ibovespa movements, mainly on periods of high volatility, due to economic crises or economic expansion where investors confidence ranges from risk aversion to euphoria.",2020-12-18,
Do Oil Prices and Financial Indicators Drive the Herding Behavior in Commodity Markets?,"This study tests the presence of herding behavior in commodity markets (energy, industrial metals, precious metals, grains food, and livestock) from a constant and time-varying perspective. Additionally, we investigate whether oil prices and major financial indicators drive herding in these markets. Using daily data over the period 2003–2017, the constant model based on the cross-sectional absolute deviation model suggests no herding in any of the commodity sectors. However, using a time-varying approach, results reveal the existence of herding in almost all sectors, mainly during and after the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the oil price contributes significantly to herding among investors in the energy sector. We also find that the major exchange rate contributes to herding only for industrial metals sectors during a very limited period. Moreover, the US stock market also has a limited contribution to herding in the energy and the industrial metals sectors.",2020-11-06,
Oil Price Volatility is Effective in Predicting Food Price Volatility. Or is it?,"Volatility spillovers between food commodities and oil prices have been identified in the literature, yet, there has been no empirical evidence to suggest that oil price volatility improves real out-of-sample forecasts of food price volatility. In this study we provide new evidence showing that oil price volatility does not improve forecasts of agricultural price volatility. This finding is based on extensive and rigorous testing of five internationally traded agricultural commodities (soybeans, corn, sugar, rough rice and wheat) and two oil benchmarks (Brent and WTI). We employ monthly and daily oil and food price volatility data and two forecasting frameworks, namely, the HAR and MIDAS-HAR, for the period 2nd January 1990 until 31st March 2017. Results indicate that oil volatility-enhanced HAR or MI-DAS-HAR models cannot systematically outperform the standard HAR model. Thus, contrary to what has been suggested by the existing literature based on in-sample analysis, we are unable to find any systematic evidence that oil price volatility improves out-of-sample forecasts of food price volatility. The results remain robust to the choice of different out-of-sample forecasting periods and three different volatility measures",2020-11-02,
Extreme price moves: an INGARCH approach to model coexceedances in commodity markets,"Abstract This study presents a set of integer-valued generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic models to identify possible transmission channels of joint extreme price moves (coexceedances) across a group of agricultural commodities. These models are very useful to identify factors affecting joint tail events and they are superior in terms of goodness of fit to models without autoregressive components. Emerging market demand, crude oil, exchange rate, stock market conditions and credit spread explain extreme joint returns. Psychological factors and the Monday effect play a role in affecting extreme events, while weather anomalies (El Niño and La Niña episodes) do not have explanatory power.",2020-10-22,
Volatility‐of‐volatility risk in the crude oil market,"Abstract This paper examines the role of oil volatility‐of‐volatility (VOV) risk under a stochastic VOV framework. We show that oil VOV is a significant pricing factor in the cross‐sectional delta‐hedged gains constructed from oil options, and oil VOV also has predictive power for near‐term delta‐hedged option gains. Moreover, we show that the information contained in oil VOV is highly specific compared to its equity counterpart and other volatility‐related measures, from the perspective of its predictability of future economic conditions. Our findings are robust to alternative VOV risk measures and forecasting horizons.",2020-10-10,
Navigating the Oil Bubble: A Non-linear Heterogeneous-agent Dynamic Model of Futures Oil Pricing,"We investigate short-term futures oil pricing over the 2003-2019 time-period in order to analyze the bubble-like dynamics, which characterizes the 2007-2009 years according to a large body of recent literature. Our research, based on the LPPL methodology and a flexible three-agent model (hedgers, fundamentalist speculators and chartists), confirms the presence of a bubble price pattern, which we attribute to the strong destabilizing behavior of speculators. In our view, this can be related to incorrect interpretation of market signals (or to the inability of trading against the market), especially by fundamentalists, combined with imitation across different categories of agents. This sets off positive feedback reactions along with self-reinforced herding of the kind best detected by the LPPL methodology.",2020-10-09,
Oil and risk premia in equity markets,"Purpose This study aims to explore the oil–stock market nexus from a novel angle by examining the predictive role of oil prices over the excess returns associated with the market, size, book-to-market and momentum factors via bivariate cross-quantilograms. Design/methodology/approach This study makes use of the bivariate cross-quantilogram methodology recently developed by Han et al. (2016) to analyze the predictability patterns across the oil and stock markets by focusing on various quantiles that formally distinguish between normal, bull and bear as well as extreme market states. Findings The study analysis of systematic risk premia across the four regions shows that crude oil returns indeed capture predictive information regarding excess factor returns in stock markets, particularly those associated with market, size and momentum factors. However, the predictive power of oil return over excess factor returns is asymmetric and primarily concentrated on extreme quantiles, suggesting that large fluctuations in oil prices capture markedly different predictive information over stock market risk premia during up and down states of the oil market. Practical implications The findings have significant implications for the profitability of factor- or style-based active portfolio strategies and suggest that the predictive information contained in oil market fluctuations could be used to enhance returns via conditional strategies based on these predictability patterns. Originality/value This study contributes to the vast literature on the oil–stock market nexus from a novel perspective by exploring the effect of oil price fluctuations on the risk premia associated with the systematic risk factors including market, size, value and momentum.",2020-09-28,
Price bubbles in agricultural commodity markets and contributing factors: evidence for corn and soybeans in China,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to detect the existence of price bubbles and examine the possible contributing factors that associate with price bubble occurrences in China agricultural commodity markets. Design/methodology/approach Using recently developed rolling window right-side augmented Dickey–Fuller test, we first detect the dates of price bubbles in China's two important agricultural commodity markets, namely corn and soybeans. Then, we use a penalized maximum likelihood estimation of a multinomial logistic model to estimate the contributing factors of price bubbles in both markets, respectively. Findings Results from the bubble detection indicate that price bubbles account for 5.48% (3.91%) of the studied periods for corn (soybeans). More importantly, we find that market liquidity and speculation have opposite effects on the occurrences of bubbles in the corn and soybeans market. World stocks-to-use and exchange rates affect the occurrences of bubbles in a different way for each commodity, as well. Price bubbles are more likely associated with strong economic activity, high interest rates and low inflation levels. Originality/value This is the first study considering commodity-specific features into the formation of price bubbles. Through accurately identifying the bubble dates and fixing the estimation bias of rare events models, this study enables us to obtain robust results for each commodity. The results imply that China's corn and soybeans market respond differently to the speculative activity and external shocks from international markets. Therefore, future policy regulations on commodity markets should focus on more commodity-specific factors when aiming at avoiding bubble occurrences.",2020-09-21,
"Dynamic relationship among the bank stability, oil, and gold prices: Evidence from the Islamic banks operating in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries","Abstract This study uses quarterly time series data to investigate the relationship between oil and gold prices, and the financial stability of Islamic banks operating in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries for the period of 2005Q1 to 2018Q1. For this purpose, first it uses Johansen cointegration and VECM methodologies, and then it employs the newly‐developed Bayer–Hanck, Gregory–Hansen, Toda–Yamamato, and DOLS methodologies to test the robustness of the findings. Results reveal a cointegrating relationship and equilibrium‐correcting mechanism between the two commodities prices and the bank stability. Both commodities prices have positive effects on bank stability in the short run. However, oil price has a positive effect in the long run, while gold price has a negative effect in the long run. The causality results confirm unidirectional causality from oil and gold prices to bank stability in the short run, and oil price to bank stability in the long run.",2020-09-14,
Does economic uncertainty matter in international commodity futures markets?,"Abstract This paper examines whether economic uncertainty risk is significantly priced in international commodity futures markets. Contrary to the belief that commodity futures are sensitive to economic uncertainty, our results provide concrete evidence that uncertainty risk is not significantly priced. To explain these results, we examine whether financial intermediaries who are supposed to be marginal investors are not uncertainty averse. We find that the effect of economic uncertainty becomes insignificant after financialization, that is, a large inflow of financial investors, in 2004 and the relation between economic uncertainty and intermediaries' leverage ratio is insignificant. These results suggest that economic uncertainty might not be priced because it is not a significant concern of financial intermediaries.",2020-09-14,
Commodity and Stock Market Interlinkages: Opportunities and Challenges for Investors in Indian Market,"This article examines the volatility links between asset markets in India with specific reference to stock and commodity markets over a period of 12 years spanning from 2006 to 2018. By employing DCC-GARCH and BEKK-GARCH, we show that the dynamic correlation between these asset markets have undergone significant changes especially after the financial crisis of 2008. The safe haven role of gold is clearly evidenced with the rising negative correlation between the two markets, while there is a rise in Crude oil volatility. Metals like Zinc, Nickel and Lead provide substantial diversification benefits to investors in the current market scenario as their correlation with the stock market have reduced considerably after 2013. There is no evidence for financialization of commodity markets in India unlike developed countries due to regulatory measures implemented by the government thereby providing investors with diversification opportunities.",2020-09-10,
Fast &amp; furious: Do psychological and legal factors affect commodity price volatility?,"Abstract The present study explores to what extent policy insecurity and the changes in the US legal financial infrastructure have affected commodity price volatility. In addition to macroeconomic fundamentals, the study introduces two ‘psychological’ factors proxied by the economic policy uncertainty index and the perception of price risk within specific commodity markets, plus an institutional (de)regulatory factor constructed as a dichotomous variable. The latter mirrors the period of financial deregulation experienced under the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and the period of regulation registered under the Dodd‐Frank Act. The results reveal that price volatility is a complex phenomenon generated by the joint effect of a plethora of drivers. Both economic policy uncertainty and highly deregulated financial markets exert an influence on price dynamics and produce higher price volatility. Similarly, higher market risk perception leads to higher price fluctuations. Exchange rate, financial wealth and crude oil further explain price rises and falls. The study indicates that government decisions influence commodity markets and a financial system grounded on a sound legal basis is essential for its orderly functioning. A transparent financial structure should be able to generate checks and balances for the market, spawn vibrant policies and prevent the negative consequences of intense price volatility.",2020-09-06,
Can commodity futures risk factors predict economic growth?,"Abstract This paper examines whether commodity futures risk factors can predict future economic growth. We test risk factors capturing various spot or term premia and find that only three factors capturing term premia on the basis‐momentum, basis, and change in slope are robust predictors for future economic growth, especially for long horizons. Our findings highlight the importance of the term premia, rather than the spot premia on which the literature has mainly focused. Moreover, we find that possible explanations for predictability of commodity factors—the intertemporal asset pricing model and information diffusion explanation—are all inconsistent with our empirical results.",2020-09-01,
Dynamic Characteristics of Crude Oil Price Fluctuation—From the Perspective of Crude Oil Price Influence Mechanism,"The uncertainty in the evolution of crude oil price fluctuation has a significant impact on economic stability. Based on the decomposition of crude oil price fluctuation by the state-space model, this paper studies the fluctuation trend of crude oil prices and its causes. The nonlinearity autoregressive distribute lag approach (NARDL) model is used to capture the influence mechanism characteristics of crude oil prices at different positions and different fluctuation trends. An event study model with dummy variables is constructed to compare the effects of different types of events on crude oil price fluctuations. The empirical results indicate that the fluctuation of crude oil prices tends to strengthen on the whole, and there is a remarkable correlation between this trend and the influencing mechanism of crude oil price, namely, the fluctuation source structure. The influence mechanism of crude oil price fluctuation is asymmetric when the crude oil price is at different positions and under different trends. There is a strong correlation between event shocks and event types in the evolution of crude oil price fluctuation.",2020-08-29,
Conditional correlation and volatility between spot and futures markets for soybean and corn,"Abstract This paper investigates the dynamics of volatility and conditional correlations between corn and soybean prices in the spot and futures markets. Faced with price and production risks, farmers must use all information available in their risk management process, both in their product's spot and futures markets, and in related products' markets, either domestic or foreign. Dynamic conditional correlation specifications with a bivariate GARCH model are employed, with data for Brazilian and U.S. markets in the period 2004–2017, during which several structural changes and extreme climate phenomena have occurred. We find the highest correlations between the corn and soybean spot markets, and evidence of spillovers in both products in the spot and futures markets. We also find that the financial crisis have significantly affected the relationship between the corn and soybean markets. We also find that in periods of increased conditional correlation between the soybean and corn markets, there is an increase in the optimal hedge ratio for risk management strategies involving corn futures contracts at B3 and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Hedging capabilities of Bitcoin for Asian currencies,"Abstract This study investigates whether Bitcoin (BTC) can provide a hedge against the fiat currencies in Asia over various investment horizons. We focus on Asia because it is one of the fastest‐growing regions worldwide, where cryptocurrencies are actively traded. A wavelet transform technique is combined with a multivariate factor stochastic volatility (SV) model to examine the dynamic correlation properties and risk reduction effectiveness of BTC in both the time and frequency domains. We use gold and oil as benchmarks and compared their results with those of BTC. The estimated correlations indicate that the Asian currencies tend to be negatively correlated with BTC; therefore, the latter could provide a hedge against the former over the medium (8–32 days) and long (32–64 days) terms. By contrast, Asian currencies tend to be positively correlated with oil and gold for the same horizons. We also analyze the downside risk reduction effectiveness of BTC for the portfolio of Asian currencies and find that BTC provides better risk reduction than oil and gold, particularly over the medium and long terms. This study makes significant contributions to the literature by demonstrating that the correlation properties and risk reduction effectiveness of BTC differ depending on the investment horizons. We believe our findings using the wavelet‐based SV model can help heterogeneous investors detect portfolio risks and thus, identify optimal hedging strategies over various investment horizons.",2020-08-17,
UNDERSTANDING RISK DISSEMINATION: AN OVERVIEW IN SOYBEAN AND CORN MARKETS,"Este artigo fornece uma visão geral da literatura de pesquisa sobre a disseminação de riscos para os mercados de milho e de soja. A revisão sistemática abarca a pesquisa, estruturação e sintetização dos estudos empíricos que utilizaram termos como contágio, transmissão e transbordamento para avaliar a propagação de riscos entre mercados. Os tópicos de destaque incluem a revisão sobre as principais óticas de análise da interação do mercado agrícola com outros mercados e os avanços teóricos na análise do risco de preços. Mudanças exógenas ao mercado agrícola como a crise financeira, ascensão dos biocombustíveis e financeirização das commodities são apontadas pela literatura como vetores de transmissão de risco para os mercados de milho e de soja. Dentre os resultados de pesquisa, cabe destacar a disseminação de artigos que avaliam a temática transbordamento, com a utilização predominante da abordagem GARCH multivariada, focada principalmente na interrelação entre os mercados de alimentos e energia.",2020-07-29,
The response of precious metal futures markets to unconventional monetary surprises in the presence of uncertainty,"Abstract This article examines the relationship between the unconventional monetary policies and precious metal futures markets by employing an asymmetric conditional volatility specification. The results suggest that the Fed announcements that likely induced lower long‐term yields on average led to significant increases in the returns, while the effect of the ECB's unconventional monetary announcements is much weaker. Also, monetary policy surprises from both Fed and ECB have larger effects on gold return volatility. Moreover, while there are no asymmetric return responses to positive and negative surprises embedded in the monetary policy from the Euro zone, the return reactions of price returns to surprises in Fed's announcements exhibit asymmetry. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the volatility reactions are limited to negative surprises. Finally, we find evidence that the response of gold price changes to monetary announcements by the Fed becomes weaker in the presence of monetary policy uncertainty. We show also that the response of precious metal returns hinges on the sign of the unexpected component of Fed announcements.",2020-07-26,
Oil and currency volatilities: Co‐movements and hedging opportunities,"Abstract The current literature concentrates its attention to the interactions between oil and exchange rates, focusing only on the first moments. Extending this line of research, we investigate the time‐varying correlation between the volatilities of two oil benchmarks (Brent and WTI) and six currencies of the major oil‐importers and oil‐exporters, for the period from February 1, 1999 to May 30, 2016, using a Diag‐BEKK model. The optimal portfolio weights and hedge ratios for portfolios comprised of the aforementioned volatilities, are also examined. The analysis reveals that oil and currency volatilities exhibit positive correlations during major global or region‐specific economic events (such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 and the EU debt crisis period). By contrast, country‐specific events yield heterogeneous time‐varying correlations between oil and the different currencies in our sample. Both the optimal portfolio weights and optimal hedge ratios estimations demonstrate a time‐varying behaviour, suggesting that continuous portfolio rebalancing is necessary for diversification purposes. The findings also show that risk reduction based on the optimal portfolio weight strategy is primarily beneficial for oil volatility investors, whereas currency volatility investors achieve better hedging using the optimal hedge ratio strategy.",2020-07-24,
The role of the threshold effect for the dynamics of futures and spot prices of energy commodities,"Abstract This study examines whether threshold models allow to better understand the dynamic relationship between spot and futures prices for crude oil and natural gas. Our findings are threefold. First, we show that the futures curve delivers relatively accurate forecasts for energy commodity prices. Second, we provide evidence that the relationship between spot and futures prices is regime dependent but accounting for this property does not improve the quality of out-of-sample forecasts. Third, we demonstrate that using information on the dynamics of financial variables (exchange rates, stock and uncertainty indices, interest rates or industrial and precious metal prices) does not contribute to the quality of futures-based forecasts. This suggests that the predictive content of these variables is already contained in futures prices.",2020-07-13,
Price Discovery and Market Reflexivity in Agricultural Futures Contracts with Different Maturities,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze market reflexivity in agricultural futures contracts with different maturities. To this end, we apply a four-dimensional Hawkes model to storable and non-storable agricultural commodities. We find market reflexivity for both storable and non-storable commodities. Reflexivity accounts for about 50 to 70% of the total trading activity. Differences between nearby and deferred contracts are less pronounced for non-storable than for storable commodities. We conclude that the co-existence of exogenous and endogenous price dynamics does not change qualitative characteristics of the price discovery process that have been observed earlier without the consideration of market reflexivity.",2020-07-11,
Dependence among Energy and Asian Emerging Stocks: A Dynamic Conditional Correlation Approach,"This paper is an endeavor to investigate the contagion effect between energy market and Asian Emerging Equity Markets (AEEMs) during the Eurozone debt crisis.Multivariate GARCH-DCC model is applied on data series from 30-01-2005 to 31-01-2012.The results affirm a significant increase in dependence between energy market and equity markets at the time of Eurozone crisis as compared to pre-crisis time, therefore supporting the presence of contagion in the sense of Forbes and Rigobon's (2002).The study implies that investors should include other commodities as well in order to hedge the equity portfolio risk at the time of crisis.",2020-06-30,
Dynamic co-movements and directional spillovers among energy futures,"Purpose This paper aims to examine dynamic equicorrelations (DECO) and directional volatility spillover effects among four energy futures markets, namely, West Texas Intermediate crude oil, heating oil, natural gas and reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending gasoline, by using a multivariate fractionally integrated asymmetric power ARCH–DECO–generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and the spillover index technique. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis uses the dynamic equicorrelation model of Engle and Kelly (2012) to examine time-varying correlations at equilibrium. The authors further analyze dynamic volatility transmission among energy futures by using Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) dynamic spillover index based on generalized value-at-risk framework. Findings The empirical results provide evidence of heightened equicorrelations at times of financial turmoil. More specifically, the dynamic spillover analysis shows that volatility is transmitted predominantly from crude oil to the other markets and risk transfer among four markets exhibits asymmetries. Spillovers are found to be highly responsive to dramatic events such as the 9/11 terror attack, 2008–2009 global financial crisis and 2014–2016 oil glut. Practical implications The results of this study have important practical implications for investors, portfolio managers and energy policymakers as the presence of time-varying co-movements and spillovers suggests the need for dynamic trading strategies. There are also implications regarding risk management practices, as there is evidence of increased volatility transmission at times of financial turmoil and uncertainty. Finally, the results provide insights to policymakers in a better understanding of the spillover dynamics. Originality/value This paper investigates the DECOs and spillover effects among crude oil, natural gas, heating oil and gasoline futures markets. To the best of the knowledge, this is one of a few studies that examine co-movements and risk transfer in energy futures in a comprehensive framework.",2020-06-26,
Impact of the global financial crisis on the crude oil market,"This study examines the effect of the 2008 global financial crisis on the crude oil market. We use the Hurst exponent, Shannon entropy, and the scaling exponent to characterize the changes in the oil market properties (i.e., efficiency, long-term equilibrium, and collective phenomena) caused by the financial crisis. Although volatility in the oil market remained the same after the crisis, we find that the crisis altered the scale-invariant property of the oil market, and it also negatively influenced market properties in terms of efficiency and long-term equilibrium. Accordingly, we propose (1) to introduce tight market regulation requesting a transaction report for sizable trades and (2) to incentivize investors to provide accurate information.",2020-06-25,
Portfolio stress testing applied to commodity futures,"Abstract In this article, we construct a portfolio of commodity futures which mimics the Dow Jones Commodity Index and perform an extensive stress testing exercise with a focus on hybrid scenarios. The increased volume of investments in commodities as financial instruments over the last decades underline the importance of a more thorough framework for stress testing of related portfolios. Our study is the first to show comparatively the marginal impact of the model choice for portfolio components versus the marginal role of tail dependence on the portfolio profit and loss in stress testing exercises. We model the distribution of returns of portfolio components with an asymmetric AR-GARCH model combined with Extreme Value Theory for extreme tails, and employ multivariate copula functions to model the time-varying joint dependence structure. Our study reveals that indeed, for a realistic stress test, a special attention should be given to the tail risk in individual commodity returns as well as to tail correlations. We also draw conclusions about parameter risk persistent in stress testing exercises. Finally yet importantly, in line with Basel IIIb, the study highlights the importance of using forward-looking hybrid and hypothetical scenarios over historical scenarios.",2020-06-01,
"Liquidity shocks, commodity financialization, and market comovements","Abstract We explore whether and how liquidity factors influence risk transfers between commodity and stock markets using a composite liquidity index and five different types of liquidity measures. We find that liquidity shocks, including both funding liquidity and market liquidity, are positively associated with comovements between commodity and stock markets after 2000, although the relationship is insignificant before 2000. The structural change indicates that financialization creates a role for adverse liquidity shocks to increase cross‐market correlations. Further evidence shows that the effect of liquidity on cross‐market correlations is state‐dependent and intensifies when liquidity conditions deteriorate and asset returns sustain substantial declines. Our findings are not explained by business cycles.",2020-05-15,

Direct Effect of TC on the LME Copper Prices,"The motivation of this paper is to identify the effect of treatment charge (TC) on LME (London Metal Exchange) copper prices. It is a fundamental variable as a supply side factor, because it is related to the smelting process and reflects the level of concentrates market tightness. To examine this question carefully, the regression model is applied. This paper finds a statistically significant negative link between TC and LME copper prices. It is found that a 10% increase in TC of copper decreases in copper return by 1.8%. Subsequently, the vector autoregression (VAR) model is introduced to consider the impact of TC to copper prices as a permanent effect. It is found that the negative impact of the TC to copper returns dies out quickly. The statistical estimation in this article will provide a good reference for future study.",2020-05-07,
The predictive power of macroeconomic uncertainty for commodity futures volatility,"Abstract We investigate whether and to what extent macroeconomic uncertainty predicts the volatility of commodity futures. By examining 26 commodities in six categories, we find that the measure of aggregate macroeconomic uncertainty based on a large dataset has a significant predictive effect for commodity volatility. The predictive relationship holds both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample after controlling for lagged volatility. The extent of the predictability differs by commodity category, with energy, precious metals, and industrial metals futures having the most significant effect. For all commodities, the predictive power of macroeconomic uncertainty is stronger in more recent data and during recessions.",2020-05-06,
The role of financial investors in determining the commodity futures risk premium,"Abstract I develop and test a model to study the interaction between the commodity and stock markets. This study attempts to clarify the debate about the effect of financialization on commodity markets. Theoretically, the futures risk premium is determined by hedging pressure, stock market returns, and the commodity–equity correlation. Empirically, the effect of the stock market on the energy market became significantly greater for the futures risk premium in the period following the 2008 crisis. Furthermore, hedging pressure is a strong explanatory variable for the futures risk premium in various circumstances.",2020-04-27,
The Natural Gas Announcement Day Puzzle,"This paper studies natural gas futures returns on EIA storage announcement days.More than 50% of the annual return is earned on these days. We find a significant difference between announcement and non-announcement day returns, which cannot be explained by the announcement surprise or other control variables. At the intraday level, the return splits half into a pre- and post-announcement part. The pre-announcement return is entirely generated on days when storage levels exceed analysts’ expectations casting doubt on explanations based on informed trading.After transaction and funding cost, a simple trading strategy yields substantial returns.Gas Markets, Announcement Effect, Storage News, Intraday",2020-04-22,
Dynamics of Arbitrage,"Abstract We study the dynamics of cash-and-carry arbitrage using the U.S. crude oil market. Sizable arbitrage-related inventory movements occur at the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures contract delivery point but not at other storage locations, where instead, operational factors explain most inventory changes. We add to the theory-of-storage literature by introducing two new features. First, due to arbitrageurs contracting ahead, inventories respond to not only contemporaneous but also lagged futures spreads. Second, storage-capacity limits can impede cash-and-carry arbitrage, leading to the persistence of unexploited arbitrage opportunities. Our findings suggest that arbitrage-induced inventory movements are, on average, price stabilizing.",2020-04-13,

Volatility Spillover Among Equity and Commodity Markets,"This study aims to examine volatility spillover among equity and commodity markets of the United States. The analysis focuses on crude oil (Brent and WTI [West Texas Intermediate]), rice, and gasoline. For the analysis, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) (1, 1) model is applied on monthly data for the period of February 2005 to December 2016. Results show that there is no volatility spillover from commodity market (gold, oil, gas, and rice) to equity market, whereas it only exists in few commodity markets, from oil to rice and gas. The study also finds that there is neither mean spillover nor volatility spillover among gold and equity market; therefore, investor can invest in equity and gold to diversify risk of portfolio.",2020-04-01,
Finansyzacja gospodarki w ujęciu makroekonomicznym,"W artykule podjęto próbę holistycznego spojrzenia na zagadnienie finansyzacji gospodarki, przyjmując perspektywę makroekonomiczną. Część pierwsza przybliża kwestie terminologiczne. Część druga poświęcona została ukazaniu czynników determinujących rozwój finansyzacji oraz etapy rozwoju tego zjawiska. W części trzeciej przedstawiono zjawiska ekonomiczne i procesy gospodarcze, których wystąpienie lub nasilenie jest wiązane z procesem finansyzacji (m.in. przekształcenia na rynkach towarowych, politykę monetarną zakładającą sterowanie inflacją, oddziaływanie sektora finansowego na wzrost gospodarczy, czy też inflację aktywów).",2020-03-30,
Assessment of Conditional Dependence Structures in Commodity Futures Markets Using Copula-GARCH Models and Fuzzy Clustering Methods,"The dynamic development of commodity derivatives markets has been observed since the mid-2000s. It is related to the development of e-commerce, the inflow of financial investors’ capital, and the emergence of exchange-traded funds and passively managed index funds focused on commodities. These advances are accompanied by changes in dependence structure in the markets. The main purpose of this study is to assess the conditional dependence structure in various commodity futures markets (energy, metals, grains and oilseeds, soft commodities, agricultural commodities) in the period from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2018. The specific purpose is to identify the states of the market corresponding to typical patterns of the conditional dependency structure, and to determine the time of transition from one state to another. The copula-based Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models were used to describe the dynamics of dependencies between the rates of return on prices of commodity futures, while the dynamic Kendall’s tau correlation coefficients were applied to measure the strength of dependencies. The daily changes in the conditional dependence structure in the markets (changes in states of the markets) were identified with the fuzzy c-means clustering method. In 2000–2018, the conditional dependence structure in commodity futures markets was not stable, as evidenced by the different states of markets identified (two states in the grains and oilseeds market, the agricultural market, the soft commodities market and the metals market, and three states in the energy market).",2020-03-24,
Global vs Sectoral Factors and the Impact of the Financialization in Commodity Price Changes,"Abstract Commodity prices influence price levels of a broad range of goods and, in the case of some developing economies, production and export activity. Therefore, information about future commodity inflation is useful for central banks, forward-looking policy-makers, and economic agents whose decisions depend on their expectations about it. After 2004, we have witnessed the so-called financialization of the commodity markets, which might induce greater communalities among commodity prices. This paper reports evidence on the relevance of the forecasting content of co-movement after 2004. With the use of large and small scale factor models we find that for the short run, in addition to dynamics, sectoral communality has relevant predictive content. For 12 months ahead, dynamics lose relevance while communality remains relevant.",2020-03-20,
CARL and His POT: Measuring Risks in Commodity Markets,"The present study aims at modelling market risk for four commodities, namely West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, natural gas, gold and corn for the period 2007–2017. To this purpose, we use Extreme Value Theory (EVT) together with a set of Conditional Auto-Regressive Logit (CARL) models to predict risk measures for the futures return series of the considered commodities. In particular, the Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) method has been combined with the Indicator and Absolute Value CARL models in order to predict the probability of tail events and the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall risk measures for the selected commodities. Backtesting procedures indicate that generally CARL models augmented with specific implied volatility outperform the benchmark model and thus they represent a valuable tool to anticipate and manage risks in the markets.",2020-03-13,
Risk Management Opportunities between Socially Responsible Investments and Selected Commodities,"Socially responsible investing (SRI) or sustainable, responsible, and impact investing is growing fast. The net total of SRI assets at the beginning of 2018 was USD 12.0 trillion. There is extensive literature on SRI, but very little of it relates to portfolio construction and risk management combining SRI and commodities. In this paper, the authors pay attention to model volatility and dynamic conditional correlations between SRI investment and selected representative of commodities. We state the following hypothesis: the potential to create portfolio and risk management opportunities exists between SRI and commodities such as grain, precious metals, and industrial metals. To verify this, modeling of volatility and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) between pair of elements is necessary. Empirical research conducted for the global market based on selected indices for SRI and commodities confirms this hypothesis. These results can improve asset selection in portfolio construction and allow investors to make more reasonable decisions.",2020-03-05,
Jumps in energy and non‐energy commodities,"Abstract Jumps in the price process of assets represent a sort of tail risk and are found to affect many aspects of asset pricing, volatility modelling and asset allocation. In this paper, we detect price jumps in the realised volatility series of a wide set of commodity futures and find evidence of jumpy behaviour, especially in energy and agricultural commodities. We examine whether the realised volatilities of commodity futures jump together and find evidence that cojumping is significant and generally clustered within the commodity groups, suggesting some sort of segmentation regarding the tail risk behaviour across energy, agricultural and metals commodities. Additional analysis shows that price jumps and macroeconomic news surprises tend to occur together in specific commodities such as crude oil, which confirms earlier findings about the sensitivity of crude oil to news about the economy.",2020-03-01,
A detailed look at crude oil price volatility prediction using macroeconomic variables,"Abstract We investigate whether crude oil price volatility is predictable by conditioning on macroeconomic variables. We consider a large number of predictors, take into account the possibility that relative predictive performance varies over the out‐of‐sample period, and shed light on the economic drivers of crude oil price volatility. Results using monthly data from 1983:M1 to 2018:M12 document that variables related to crude oil production, economic uncertainty and variables that either describe the current stance or provide information about the future state of the economy forecast crude oil price volatility at the population level 1 month ahead. On the other hand, evidence of finite‐sample predictability is very weak. A detailed examination of our out‐of‐sample results using the fluctuation test suggests that this is because relative predictive performance changes drastically over the out‐of‐sample period. The predictive power associated with the more successful macroeconomic variables concentrates around the Great Recession until 2015. They also generate the strongest signal of a decrease in the price of crude oil towards the end of 2008.",2020-02-29,
Extreme downside risk co-movement in commodity markets during distress periods: a multidimensional scaling approach,"We analyze the co-movement of a number of commodity markets in extreme financial episodes worldwide. More specifically, we provide extreme downside risk co-movement maps of these markets during six recent distress periods. We follow an expected shortfall-multidimensional scaling approach, which allows for an easy classification of markets according to their dynamics in risky episodes. No clear risk co-movement patterns are observed, nor spillover effects are detected. Financialization and speculation might have played some role in the dynamics of price and risk only in food commodity markets during the oil price increase 2007–2008.",2020-02-12,
Tail dependence in emerging ASEAN-6 equity markets: empirical evidence from quantitative approaches,"Abstract This study contributes a rich set of quantitative methodologies including a non-parametric approach (Chi-plots and K-plots) as well as copulas (traditional and time-varying with Student’s t-copulas) to the existing literature in terms of determining the dependence structure in ASEAN stock markets. Drawing on the emerging ASEAN equity returns of six countries from January 2001 to December 2017, we found that Student’s t-copulas under time-varying approach is the most appropriate approach to explain these co-movements. Among all research return pairs, the dependence between Vietnam and other ASEAN equity indices has the lowest value. Meanwhile, all couples show left- and right- tail dependence by each pair for pre- and post- financial shocks. Hence, diversification across these pairs of equity markets from ASEAN is still adequate for international investors, though it might trigger contagion risks.",2020-01-13,
The Serial Dependence of the Commodity Futures Returns: A Machine Learning Approach,"This paper uses machine learning tools to study the serial dependence (lead-lag relations) of commodity futures returns during the post financialization period (January 2004 – December 2019). We use LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to select the predictors as the number of predictors is large relative to the number of observations. We find significant full-sample and out-of-sample predictability. In the full sample, we find that LASSO can identify a sparse set of predictors that come from economically linked commodities or are likely driven by excessive speculative trading. The out-of-sample forecasts based on the LASSO generate statistically and economically large gains. When we separate the indexed futures from the non-indexed futures and replicate the above analysis, we find that the out-of-sample performance exists in the indexed futures but disappears in the non-indexed futures. The lead-lag relations are also more significant after the advent of ETF or ETNs that track the broad futures indices such as S&P GSCI and BCOM indices, indicating that index trading due to financialization drives the excessive comovement among the commodity futures. Overall, we find that serial dependence generates significant predictability during the sample period when the performance of the long-only commodity index futures is poor.",2020-01-01,
Comovement and Instability in Cryptocurrency Markets,"We analyze the extent of comovement between daily price returns of nine major cryptocurrenciesfrom April 2013 to February 2021. We assess its evolution using bivariate and multivariate modelling approaches, and detect pronounced time variation. Generally, comovement is initially low and positive, but increases substantially between early 2017 and late 2018 and stays high until the end of the sample. We then adopt a right-tail version of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test to identify periods of mildly explosive behavior (statistical instability) in the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio of seven cryptocurrencies. The NVT ratio is a novel measure of the dollar value of cryptocurrency transaction activity relative to network value. We show evidence of significant mild explosiveness in all seven cryptocurrencies. In 2018 and in the second half of 2019, several cryptocurrencies experience often simultaneous instability. Instability is a dominant feature of these markets.",2020-01-01,
Asset Classes and Portfolio Diversification: Evidence from a Stochastic Spanning Approach,"We propose a stochastic spanning approach to assess whether a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds spans augmented portfolios including commodities, foreign exchange, and real estate. We empirically show that in all seven portfolio combinations, the augmented portfolio is not spanned by the traditional one. Our results are further confirmed by both parametric and non-parametric tests in an out-of-sample setting. Therefore, traditional investors can generally benefit in terms of higher Sharpe ratios from augmenting their portfolio with alternative asset classes. Additional analysis demonstrates that diversification benefits can be explained by the current state of the U.S. economy and stock markets.",2020-01-01,
Time Series Modeling of Dynamic Responses of Commodity Prices to Monetary Policy Shocks in Ghana,"The Vector Error Correction (VEC) model was used to assess the impact of monetary policy rate on commodity prices in Ghana. Monthly data on monetary policy rate, commodity prices of cocoa, gold and crude oil from January 2005 to December 2017 obtained from the Bank of Ghana was used for the study. The estimated VEC model aided in establishing long and short run relationships between monetary policy rates and the major commodity prices in Ghana. The study revealed that in the long run, monetary policy rates are negatively correlated to crude oil prices, positively correlated to both cocoa prices and gold prices but to a little extent. It was also evident from the study that in the short run, the first lag of monetary policy rate is negatively related to itself and the second lag of monetary policy rate is positively related to itself. Additionally, the first and second lagged periods of cocoa price have positive influence on monetary policy rate in the short run, but the first and second lagged periods of gold price have negative influence on monetary policy rates in the short run. The Granger causality test also reveals that the movement of cocoa prices in Ghana can be explained to cause the movement of monetary policy rates and gold prices in short run. A positive shock in monetary policy rate will have a positive and persistent effect on itself. Likewise, positive shock in monetary policy rate will have a positive and persistent effect on cocoa prices. The response generated from a positive shock on monetary policy rate has a persistent and decreasing effect on both crude oil and gold prices.",2020-01-01,
Anomalies in Commodity Futures Markets: Risk or Mispricing?,"In recent years, commodity markets have become increasingly popular among financial investors. While previous studies document a factor structure, not much is known about how prominent anomalies are priced in commodity futures markets. We examine a large set of such anomaly variables. We identify sizable premia for jump risk, momentum, skewness, and volatility-of-volatility. Other prominent variables, such as downside beta, idiosyncratic volatility, and MAX, are not priced in commodity futures markets. Commodity investors should rebalance their portfolios regularly. Returns for annual holding periods are substantially weaker than for monthly rebalancing.",2020-01-01,
Speculator Spreading Pressure and Commodity Futures Risk Premium,"This paper investigates the impact of trading on the commodity futures risk premium. We focus on intra-commodity spreading positions and study the asset pricing implications of spreading pressure (SP), that is, spreading positions scaled by open interest, on the cross-section of commodity futures returns. We document that SP negatively predicts futures excess returns. A battery of empirical tests shows that SP helps separate commodities that trade based on economic fundamentals from commodities that are subject to market frictions introduced via commodity index investments. We propose an SP factor, a long-short portfolio based on SP that is priced in the commodity futuresmarket, even after controlling for well-known factors, and is robust to accounting foromitted variable biases and measurement errors",2020-01-01,
Risk Premia in the Term Structure of Crude Oil Futures: Long-Run and Short-Run Volatility Components,"This paper studies how volatility affects the risk premium in crude oil futures through a discrete-time term structure model with long-run and short-run GARCH-type volatility components. Estimated using WTI crude oil futures data from January 1990 to July 2016, our model simultaneously matches futures prices and volatilities for the nearest twelve maturities. We document a significant positive relation between volatility and futures risk premia before May 2005, but a significant negative relation after that. The dynamic change of the risk-return relationship concur with the structural change, specifically the financialization, in the commodity markets. Risk premia decomposition indicates that the short-run volatility component represents the most important contribution to futures risk premia, both before and after the structural break.",2020-01-01,
Investing in Commodities in Times of Uncertainty and Lax Monetary Policy,"This chapter presents empirical evidence showing the impact of economic uncertainty and monetary policy on the volatility of commodity futures markets. The findings are in line with those of the relevant literature according to which rising uncertainty predicts rising volatility in commodity markets. The author shows that the unobservable economic uncertainty measures of Jurado et al. (2015) have a significant and long-lasting positive impact on the volatility of commodity prices. Hence, the OLS regression results show that commodity markets are significantly affected by the rising degree of unpredictability in the macroeconomy, while they are relatively immune to observable macroeconomic fluctuations. The expansionary monetary policy is followed by rising volatility in agricultural and energy markets, while it has much smaller effect on the volatility of metals markets. Financialization in commodity markets has increased the dynamic linkages between monetary policy shocks and commodity price volatility.",2020-01-01,
Firm age and crude oil returns: Stock price sensitivity of oil-producing and consuming companies,"This study aims to identify firm characteristics that affect the cross-firm variation in oil–stock interactions. A panel data analysis with a sample of U.S. and Canadian firms reveals that the stock price sensitivity to crude oil price returns is negatively and significantly associated with firm age. Contrary to a common belief, firm size or stock liquidity does not seem to influence heterogeneity in oil–stock relationships. My finding is consistent across oil-producing and consuming companies while the effect of firm age is not observed among financial institutions engaged in commodity trading. An additional test using the panel Granger causality approach shows no lagged effect of oil market movement on the oil and gas extraction firms, suggesting their prompt response to market information.",2020-01-01,
Extreme Price Co-Movement of Commodity Futures and Industrial Production Growth: An Empirical Evaluation,"This paper studies how the extreme price co-movement of commodity futures indicates industrial production (IP) growth. In this regard, we model synchronized movements and large price changes into one measure by characterizing upside and downside price extremes. We find that the derived price extremes are positively associated with IP growth over the next quarter. We further conclude that such impact is not symmetric, as the impact led by downside extremes is robust whereas that of upside extremes is not. Our results reinforce the informational friction theory as well as those financial studies that emphasize downside risk.",2020-01-01,
The Natural Gas Announcement Day Puzzle,"This paper studies natural gas futures returns on EIA storage announcement days. More than 50% of the annual return is earned on these days. We find a significant difference between announcement and non-announcement day returns, which cannot be explained by the announcement surprise or other control variables. At the intraday level, the return splits half into a pre- and post-announcement part. The pre-announcement return is entirely generated on days when storage levels exceed analysts’ expectations casting doubt on explanations based on informed trading. After transaction and funding cost, a simple trading strategy yields substantial returns.",2020-01-01,
The Economic Impact of Volatility Persistence on Energy Markets,"This study examines the role of daily volatility persistence in determining future volatility in energy markets. In crude oil and natural gas markets, the impact of returns and variances is primarily transmitted to future volatility via the daily volatility persistence. Macro-economic factors, such as the VIX, the credit spread and the Baltic exchange dirty index, also impact future volatility, but this impact is again channeled via the volatility persistence. The dependence of volatility persistence on macro-economic conditions is termed conditional volatility persistence (CVP). The variation in daily CVP is economically significant, contributing up to 17% of future volatility and accounting for 25% of the model's explanatory power. Inclusion of the CVP in the model significantly improves volatility forecasts. Based on the utility benefits of volatility forecasts, the CVP adjusted volatility models provide up to 160 bps benefit to investors compared to the HAR models, even after accounting for transaction costs and varying trading speeds.",2020-01-01,
Exploiting the Dynamics of Commodity Futures Curves,"The Nelson-Siegel framework is employed to model the term structure of commodity futures prices. Exploiting the information embedded in the level, slope and curvature parameters, we develop novel investment strategies that assume short-term continuation of recent parallel, slope or butterfly movements of futures curves. Systematic strategies based on the change in the slope generate significant profits that are unrelated to previously documented risk factors and can survive reasonable transaction costs. Further analysis demonstrates that the profits of the slope strategy rise with investor sentiment and are partly compensation for the drawdowns incurred during economic slowdowns. The profitability can also be magnified through timing and remains persistent under alternative specifications of the Nelson-Siegel model.",2020-01-01,
The Economic Impact of Volatility Persistence on Energy Markets,"This study examines the role of daily volatility persistence in transmitting information from macro-economy in the volatility of energy markets. In crude oil and natural gas markets, macro-economic factors, such as the VIX, the credit spread and the Baltic exchange dirty index, impact volatility, and this impact is channeled via the volatility persistence. Further, the impact of returns and variances is primarily transmitted to volatility via the daily volatility persistence. The dependence of volatility persistence on market and macro-economic conditions is termed conditional volatility persistence (CVP). The variation in daily CVP is economically significant, contributing up to 17% of future volatility and accounting for 25% of the model's explanatory power. Inclusion of the CVP in the model significantly improves volatility forecasts.

The Theory of Normal Backwardization Financialization of the Futures Markets,"Over the past twenty years there has 1 been a large inflow of investment capital into commodity futures markets-the financialization of commodities. This chapter analyses the behavior of commodity futures contract returns before and since finalization of the markets. We believe that Professor Gordon C. Rausser's research in the 1970s contributed to the dramatic inflow of speculative investment into commodity futures, because he showed there were possible profits to be made ""right at the edge of randomness"" with computerized trading rules. Using the methodology in Carter, Rausser and Schmitz (1983) we find that the financialization impacted the Keynesian risk premiums in the futures market, as the market became over-crowded with speculative money.",2020-01-01,

How Crude Oil Futures Connected with Exchange Rates around COVID-19 Shock? A Tale of Two Markets,"We examine the high-frequency intraday return and volatility transmission between crude oil futures prices and exchange rates around the COVID-19 shock for both the newly established Renminbi-denominated INE in China and the dollar-denominated Brent in the UK. With controlling for the influence from the stock markets, we find significant disparities in return linkages but quite similar volatility transmission patterns. The INE shows no return linkages with the exchange rates except before the shock, while the Brent consistently shows return spillovers from crude oil futures prices to exchange rates. The volatility spillovers are unidirectional—from exchange rates to crude oil futures prices—before the shock and change into bidirectional under the shock for both INE and Brent. Nevertheless, both return and volatility spillover patterns in China resemble that in the UK when using offshore instead of onshore exchange rates. These findings carry important practical implications.",2020-01-01,
"Dependence risk analysis in energy, agricultural and precious metals commodities: a pair vine copula approach","We apply pair vine copulas, specifically the C-vine and R-vine copulas, to examine the conditional multivariate dependence pattern/structure and R-vine copula-based value-at-risk (VaR) to assess financial portfolio risk. We examine the co-dependencies of 13 major commodity markets (which include three energy commodities, six agricultural commodities and four precious metals prices) from 2 January 2003 to 19 December 2016. Dividing our sample into three sub-periods, namely pre-GFC, GFC and post-GFC, we find that the dependencies among commodities undergo changes in a complex manner, changing in different financial conditions, and that the Student-t copula appears on the maximum number of occasions, especially during the GFC period, signifying the existence of fatter tails in the distributions of returns. We further show that the co-dependencies computed using R-vine copulas are best suited to compute the portfolio VaR during the considered time period.",2019-12-25,
"Predicting Volatility and Dynamic Relation Between Stock Market, Exchange Rate and Select Commodities","Commodities play a vital role in the development of emerging economies, like India. From this perspective, the study presents dynamic correlation in the prices of gold, crude oil, exchange rate and Indian stock market from April 01, 2014 to March 28, 2018. VARMA-BEKK-GARCH model is estimated for return and volatility spillovers across markets. Bidirectional returns spillover was found between Nifty and WTI and WTI and Gold pair. Whereas the bidirectional volatility spillover between Nifty and Gold pair. From the DCC-GARCH correlational analysis, Gold was found to be effective hedging commodity for Indian stock investors than Crude Oil. The asymmetric impact of shocks in covariance is observed between Nifty 50 and all other variables. The study focuses to aid investors and portfolio diversifiers while taking investment decisions.",2019-12-22,
Estimating the connectedness of commodity futures using a network approach,"Abstract Using a network approach of variance decompositions, we measure the connectedness of 18 commodity futures and characterize both static and dynamic connectedness. Our results show that metal futures are net transmitters of shocks to other futures, and agricultural futures are vulnerable to shocks from the others. Furthermore, almost two‐thirds of the volatility uncertainty for commodity futures are due to the connectedness of shocks across the futures market. Dynamically, we find connectedness always increases in times of turmoil. An analysis of connectedness networks suggests that investors could be forewarned that the connectedness of various classes of futures could threaten their portfolios.",2019-12-19,
Volatility term structures in commodity markets,"Abstract In this study, we comprehensively examine the volatility term structures in commodity markets. We model state‐dependent spillovers in principal components (PCs) of the volatility term structures of different commodities, as well as that of the equity market. We detect strong economic links and a substantial interconnectedness of the volatility term structures of commodities. Accounting for intra‐commodity‐market spillovers significantly improves out‐of‐sample forecasts of the components of the volatility term structure. Spillovers following macroeconomic news announcements account for a large proportion of this forecast power. There thus seems to be substantial information transmission between different commodity markets.",2019-12-16,
Does economic policy uncertainty matter for commodity market in China? Evidence from quantile regression,"This paper investigates the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on China's agricultural and metal commodity futures returns across quantiles. We address this issue using the panel quantile regression approach, which allows for a more complete analysis of various conditions in the commodity market (i.e. bearish, normal, and bullish markets). Our empirical results reveal that domestic EPU shocks have a significantly negative effect on agricultural futures returns in bearish markets and a significantly positive effect on metal futures returns in bullish markets. The impacts of both domestic and U.S. EPU shocks on commodity markets are heterogeneous across quantiles and are sector specific. Additionally, by isolating positive and negative EPU shocks, the regression and test results indicate an asymmetric response of commodity futures prices in bullish markets. Moreover, our findings indicate that the metal futures market has a higher financialisation level than the agricultural futures market. The findings can be utilized by policymakers and investors.",2019-12-08,
The Impact of Emerging Asia´s Demand on the Pacific Alliance Countries,"This article presents new evidence on the economic links between Asia and Latin America. Estimates from a Bayesian vector autoregression model show that key macroeconomic variables of the Pacific Alliance countries (Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Colombia) have a significant response to shocks on Emerging Asia's demand. The spillover effects show that Peru is the country that is most vulnerable to income shocks in Emerging Asia. Nevertheless, developed economies' shocks are still significant when it comes to explain the macroeconomic performances of Colombia, Chile, and especially, Mexico.",2019-12-06,
Detection and Estimation of Herd Behavior in Futures Market,"With the rapid development of Chinese commodity futures markets and the financialization problem during recent times, there are lots of price rises and drops which can be described as herd behavior in our commodity futures market. Herd behavior and its impact on futures returns are attractive topics in behavioral finance. The basic motivation of this project is to study the interactions between herd behavior and futures returns. Various models are implemented to analysis the herd behavior. We find that there exists significant herd behavior in metal future market and the financialization can aggravates the herd behavior. However, there is no obvious herd behavior in agricultural futures market.",2019-12-01,
Historical Returns of the Market Portfolio,"Abstract We create an annual return index for the invested global multiasset market portfolio. We use a newly constructed unique data set covering the entire market of financial investors. We analyze returns and risk from 1960 to 2017, a period during which the market portfolio realized a compounded real return in U.S. dollars of 4.45%, with a standard deviation of annual returns of 11.2%. The compounded excess return was 3.39%. We publish these data on returns of the market portfolio, so they can be used for future asset pricing and corporate finance studies. Received March 4, 2019; editorial decision October 9, 2019 by Editor Jeffrey Pontiff. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",2019-11-22,
Financialization of agricultural commodities: Evidence from China,"Speculation in the commodity futures market distorts commodity prices, driving them away from rational levels. This phenomenon, which is known as the financialization of commodities, has raised significant concerns in recent years. Particularly, in the agricultural market, 'financialized' commodities have been blamed for high world food prices. In this paper, we examine the financialization of agricultural commodities in China. To do so, a time-varying copula is employed to investigate the dependence structure between commodities and stock markets. Four insightful results are obtained. First, positive correlations between agricultural commodities and stock markets demonstrate the financialization of agricultural commodities. Second, the identified correlations are time-varying and idiosyncratic with respect to products. Third, the agricultural commodity market is more closely correlated with the domestic stock market than with the overseas market. Fourth, a growing dependence between commodities and the stock markets is detected and the co-movement became stronger after the global financial crisis.",2019-11-15,
EXTREMAL DEPENDENCIES ON COMMODITY FUTURES MARKETS,"The aim of this study was to assess dependencies between extreme rates of return from commodity futures contracts on selected markets in the years 2000-2018. In periods of upheavals and turbulences, in markets for investors and portfolio management, it is crucial to estimate the probability of risk factors simultaneously taking extreme values. The analyses were conducted on dependencies between extreme rates of return (asymptotic dependencies) on markets of futures contracts for energy, metals and agricultural products in the years 2000-2018, applying the Copula-ARMA-GARCH models and tail dependence coefficients. Relatively strong and permanent asymptotic dependencies were found for pairs of futures contracts for crude oil and heating oil, while either no such dependencies were observed or only appeared during the subprime crisis and assumed very low values for other energy pairs of futures contracts and pairs of agricultural futures contracts, in which at least one of the contracts was concluded for soft commodities.",2019-11-14,
A Tale of Two Premiums: The Role of Hedgers and Speculators in Commodity Futures Markets,"ABSTRACT This paper studies the dynamic interaction between the net positions of traders and risk premiums in commodity futures markets. Short‐term position changes are driven mainly by the liquidity demands of noncommercial traders, while long‐term variation is driven primarily by the hedging demands of commercial traders. These two components influence expected futures returns with opposite signs. The gains from providing liquidity by commercials largely offset the premium they pay for obtaining price insurance.",2019-10-12,
The Impact of Jumps and Leverage in Forecasting the Co-Volatility of Oil and Gold Futures,"This paper investigates the impact of jumps in forecasting co-volatility in the presence of leverage effects for daily crude oil and gold futures. We use a modified version of the jump-robust covariance estimator of Koike (2016), such that the estimated matrix is positive definite. Using this approach, we can disentangle the estimates of the integrated co-volatility matrix and jump variations from the quadratic covariation matrix. Empirical results show that more than 80% of the co-volatility of the two futures contains jump variations and that they have significant impacts on future co-volatility but that the impact is negligible in forecasting weekly and monthly horizons.",2019-09-02,
The time‐to‐maturity pattern of futures price sensitivity to news,"Abstract This paper examines the effect time‐to‐maturity has on how sensitive futures prices are to news flows. Unscheduled daily news flows that relate to the underlying asset of a futures contract are related to the daily realized volatility of futures to calculate a price‐news sensitivity ratio. The observed pattern follows an inverted U‐shape relationship and has a bearing on whether the maturity effect will be noticeable in a futures contract. This paper also shows that by examining the peak‐to‐maturity of the price sensitivity to news pattern, it is possible to better identify which contracts are more likely to yield higher volatility.",2019-08-14,
"What Drives Commodity Returns? Market, Sector or Idiosyncratic Factors?","Abstract This paper examines the relationship between 43 commodity returns using a dynamic factor model with time varying stochastic volatility. The dynamic factor model decomposes each commodity return into a common (market), sector‐specific and commodity‐specific component. It enables the variance attributed to each component to be estimated at each point in time. We find the return variation explained by the common factor has increased substantially for the recent period and is statistically significant for the vast majority of commodities since 2004 (at each point in time) This phenomenon is the strongest for non‐perishable products. We link the amount of variation explained by the common factor to economic variables.",2019-08-06,
Panorama da literatura sobre a financeirização (1992-2017): uma abordagem bibliométrica,"Resumo O propósito deste artigo é apresentar um panorama da literatura sobre a financeirização entre 1992 e 2017 a partir de uma abordagem bibliométrica, com a utilização do software VOSviewer. Especificamente, busca-se delinear o estado da arte da literatura, identificando os trabalhos, veículos de publicação e autores-chave, bem como os subcampos nos quais as contribuições têm se distribuído. Propõe-se a identificação de cinco grandes abordagens. Uma primeira vertente remete à análise da financeirização a partir da crítica à maximização do valor ao acionista. Um segundo grupo representa um conjunto amplo de trabalhos de teor marxista e pós-keynesiano, cujo foco reside na avaliação da financeirização como um novo padrão de acumulação. Um terceiro agrupamento se organiza em torno do espraiamento das normas, práticas, regras de conduta e vocabulário típicos dos mercados financeiros na sociedade e seu impacto na vida cotidiana. Um quarto conjunto concentra-se na avaliação da forma pela qual as finanças contemporâneas condicionam a organização do espaço, particularmente das áreas urbanas. Por fim, um quinto grupo dedica-se ao exame do impacto da financeirização na atividade rural, particularmente nas economias subdesenvolvidas dependentes das exportações de commodities.",2019-08-01,
"Interaction between Oil Price and Investor Sentiment: Nonlinear Causality, Time- Varying Influence, and Asymmetric Effect","This paper investigates the interaction between crude oil prices and individual investor sentiment with the Hiemstra and Jones (HJ) test, the Diks and Panchenko (DP) test, the time-varying parameter structural vector autoregression (TVP-SVAR) model, and the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags (NARDL) model. Results reveal a bidirectional nonlinear Granger causality, rather than a linear Granger causality, between crude oil prices and individual investor sentiment. Meanwhile, the interactions between the two variables are time-varying, and oil prices negatively affect individual investor sentiment in general. However, the effect of individual sentiment on oil prices is more complicated. It has more significant impacts on oil prices after 2000, and shows a positive influence before the global financial crisis, a minor influence during the crisis, and even a negative influence after the crisis. In addition, the oil price has significant long-run and short-run asymmetric effects on individual investor sentiment, whereas individual investor sentiment has no asymmetric effect on oil prices.",2019-07-12,
Do Crude Oil Prices Drive the Relationship between Stock Markets of Oil-Importing and Oil-Exporting Countries?,"The impact that oil market shocks have on stock markets of oil-related economies has several implications for both domestic and foreign investors. Thus, we investigate the role of the oil market in deriving the dynamic linkage between stock markets of oil-exporting and oil-importing countries. We employed a DCC-FIGARCH model to assess the dynamic relationship between these markets over the period between 2000 and 2018. Our findings report the following regularities: First, the oil-stock markets’ relationship and that between oil-importing and oil-exporting countries’ stock markets themselves is time-varying. Moreover, we note that the response of stock market returns to oil price changes in oil-importing countries changes is more pronounced than for oil-exporting countries during periods of turmoil. Second, the oil-stock dynamic correlations tend to change as a result of the origin of oil prices shocks stemming from the period of global turmoil or changes in the global business cycle. Third, oil prices significantly drive the relationship between oil-importing and oil-exporting countries’ stock markets in both high and low oil-stock correlation regimes.",2019-07-10,
Giving and receiving: Exploring the predictive causality between oil prices and exchange rates,"Abstract We study the dynamic connectedness and predictive causality between oil prices and exchange rates. Our sample includes six important oil‐producing and six net importing countries. Our results show that for the first set of countries, oil prices are net spillover receivers from exchange rate markets. Similarly, there is evidence of bidirectional Granger causality, which is detected for longer time periods from these countries’ exchange rates to oil prices. In contrast, for the second set of countries, oil prices are net spillover transmitters, and the causality is stronger from oil prices to exchange rates, mainly in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. However, even for this group of countries, there are long periods of time for which exchange‐rate markets transmit spillovers to oil markets. Overall, oil markets are net receivers of shocks during most of the sample period, thus providing evidence in favor of the oil‐financialization hypothesis.",2019-07-10,
"Economic uncertainty, trading activity, and commodity futures volatility","Abstract This paper investigates the dynamics of commodity futures volatility. I derive the variance decomposition for the futures basis and show unexpected excess returns result from new information about expected future interest rates, convenience yields, and risk premia. Measures of uncertainty in economic conditions have significant predictive power for realized volatility of commodity futures returns, after controlling for lagged volatility, returns, commodity index trading, hedging pressure, and other trading activity, even during the so‐called “index financialization” period. During this period, hedge fund performance predicts volatility in grain commodities, which are affected by the US ethanol mandate.",2019-07-03,
Analysis of Herd Behavior In Commodity Futures Markets,"Yatırım karar sürecinde kendi bilgi ve görüşlerini göz ardı ederek diğerlerini taklit etmek olarak tanımlanan sürü davranışı, özellikle kriz dönemlerinde finansal piyasaların temel bir karakteristiği olabilmektedir. Bu çalışmanın temel amacı, sürü davranışının emtia futures piyasalarındaki olası varlığını 06.01.1998-07.06.2018 döneminde incelemektir. Çalışmada emtia futures sözleşmelerinin getiri oranlarının yatay kesit değişkenliğine dayanan Christie ve Huang (1995) ve Chang, Cheng ve Khorana (2000)’nın metodolojileri ile beta katsayılarının yatay kesit değişkenliğine dayalı olan Hwang ve Salmon (2004)’un yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Getirilerin yatay kesit değişkenlik ile piyasa getirileri arasındaki ilişkinin doğrusal olduğunu varsayan Christie ve Huang (1995)’ın yönteminden elde edilen bulgularda sürü davranışı görülmezken, bu ilişkinin doğrusal olmadığını savunan Chang, Cheng ve Khorana (2000) yönteminden elde edilen sonuçlar, emtia futures piyasasında sürü davranışının var olduğu hipotezini desteklemekte ve yatay kesit değişkenlik ile yüksek ve düşük getiri oranları arasındaki ilişkinin doğrusal olmadığını göstermektedir. Bulgular, özelikle piyasada artışların olduğu dönemlerde sürü davranışının etkilerinin daha belirgin olduğunu görülmektedir. Ayrıca, betaların yatay kesit değişkenliğine dayalı metodolojiden elde edilen bulgular da belirli dönemlerde sürü davranışının ortaya çıktığını göstermektedir.",2019-06-30,
Price discovery in commodity derivatives: Speculation or hedging?,"Abstract We investigate whether commodity futures or options markets play a more important role in the price discovery process in the six most actively traded markets: crude oil, natural gas, gold, silver, corn, and soybeans. Using new information leadership techniques, we report new evidence and report that both markets make a meaningful contribution to price discovery in recent times; however, on average, options lead futures in reflecting new information for a majority of these commodities. We find that increased speculation, rather than hedging activity, in commodity derivatives is a key determinant of price discovery in the options markets.",2019-06-27,
Modeling and forecasting commodity market volatility with long‐term economic and financial variables,"Abstract This paper investigates the time‐varying volatility patterns of some major commodities as well as the potential factors that drive their long‐term volatility component. For this purpose, we make use of a recently proposed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity–mixed data sampling approach, which typically allows us to examine the role of economic and financial variables of different frequencies. Using commodity futures for Crude Oil (WTI and Brent), Gold, Silver and Platinum, as well as a commodity index, our results show the necessity for disentangling the short‐term and long‐term components in modeling and forecasting commodity volatility. They also indicate that the long‐term volatility of most commodity futures is significantly driven by the level of global real economic activity as well as changes in consumer sentiment, industrial production, and economic policy uncertainty. However, the forecasting results are not alike across commodity futures as no single model fits all commodities.",2019-06-24,
Effect of Speculators’ Position Changes on the LME Futures Market,"This paper employs Granger causality tests to analyze the role of speculators using weekly COTR (commitment of traders reports) data covering the period of August 2014 to July 2017. The paper presents statistically significant evidence that the position changes of speculators, such as hedge funds and CTAs (commodity trading advisors), unidirectionally Granger-cause the prices of base metals, such as aluminum, copper, and zinc. This finding is a result of causality going from the levels of net futures positions of money managers to futures price changes on the London Metal Exchange (LME). However, producers’ and swap dealers’ speculative roles in price-formation are rejected in Granger causality tests. This paper presents clear results with important market implications.",2019-06-14,
On the co-movements among gold and other financial markets: a multivariate time-varying asymmetric approach,"The analysis of time varying correlation between gold price and financial market in the context of international investments has been well researched in the literature in last few years. In this paper we study the interdependence of three financial markets and the gold price. We adopt a multivariate asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation EGARCH framework, during the period spanning from January 5, 1995 until May 30, 2017. The empirical results suggest asymmetric responses in correlations among gold market and financial market. We find that asymmetric dynamic correlations exhibit substantial time variation even in similar market tensions for same pairs of assets. Our findings imply that investors and fund managers should take into account the asymmetric dependence structure, which depends on the upside or downside of the market.",2019-06-06,
Commodity Market and Financial Derivative Instruments: Is There a Cointegration,"Over the past decade, agricultural commodity prices underwent wild swings.Periods of high growth in 2008 were followed by periods of sudden decrease in 2009.The excessive increase in food price volatility is a subject of great interest because it has to do with the survival of mankind.Recent academic studies and policy makers have reached sharply different conclusions about the dynamics of such fluctuations.Also, some of them have indicated the main cause in speculative transactions and in the little regulation of futures markets.This paper intends to verify if there exists a co-implication between wheat futures price and some financial ""speculative"" variables.The results of cointegration analysis show that there is no evidence that financial derivative instruments determine the fluctuations of wheat futures price.",2019-04-28,
How well can investors diversify with commodities? Evidence from a flexible copula approach,"Purpose This paper aims to investigate empirically the linkages between stock and commodity futures markets. Design/methodology/approach It involves the application of a flexible copula approach to weekly total returns from the S&amp;P 500 index and from three commodity sub-indices (agriculture, metals and energy) from 1995 to 2017. Findings Co-movement is by no means frequent and symmetric. It was predominantly zero before the last financial crisis, and since then, it is positive and asymmetric. The pattern of asymmetry is consistent with transmission of shocks under extreme negative shocks only. Recently, total returns of commodity futures are very poor. At the same time, commodity futures markets move in step (out of step) with stock markets when the latter plunge (rise), pointing to limited diversification benefits. These appear to justify the concerns of investors and researchers whether including commodities in a portfolio of assets is still a prudent investment strategy. Originality/value It is the only manuscript that combines a flexible copula approach and co-movement measurement along both the positive and negative diagonals. The findings are in sharp contrast with those reported by Delatte and Lopez (2013) and are very important for portfolio management.",2019-04-15,
An Analysis of the Impact of the Financialization of Commodity Markets,"There is growing evidence that the dramatic increase in real commodity prices from 2002-2011 cannot be attributed solely to fundamental (demand and supply) factors. Over this period, there was major growth in the trading activities of financial investors in commodity derivative markets. This process, termed “financialization”, had important effects on price dynamics. This paper calculates rolling correlations for futures and spot returns for different commodities both for the period 2002-2011 when commodity prices were rising, and also from 2011-2015, when prices were falling. The paper finds a rise in correlations of index-based commodities during the period of rising prices, when commodity assets under management grew rapidly, and a fall during the period of declining prices, when commodity assets under management halved, supporting the view that financialization played a role in driving prices. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that the same increase and decrease in correlations did not occur for bulk commodities. Granger causality tests reveal evidence of futures prices driving spot prices during the financialization period when prices were rising. However, there is a shift to more bi-directional relationships when prices (and correlations) fell. These findings support the role of financialization during the period of rising prices, as investor exposure to index-based commodities was usually achieved through the futures market.",2019-04-01,

Heterogeneous Impacts of International Oil Price Shocks on the Stock Market – Evidence from China,"This article examines the effects of international oil price shocks on the Chinese stock market with explicitly considering the financialization of oil market. Empirical results based on the threshold structural VAR show that the response of stock returns is heterogeneous across regimes and sectors and depends on the source of oil shocks. Generally, oil price shocks have a larger impact on Chinese stocks in the bear regime than in the bull regime, and such nonlinearity is more pronounced for oil supply shocks and aggregate demand shocks. At the sector level, the nonlinear effects of oil price shocks are particularly obvious in the energy, industrials, and consumer discretionary sectors. Furthermore, oil shocks also affect the probability of the stock market switching between bull and bear regimes. The regime switching behavior acts as an important propagator of oil shocks which can explain the differences in risk premiums among quintiles of oil-beta portfolio returns. Although its direct effect on stock returns is limited, oil market's financialization may trigger regime shifts in several sectors.",2019-02-20,
"Clarifying the Response of Gold Return to Financial Indicators: An Empirical Comparative Analysis Using Ordinary Least Squares, Robust and Quantile Regressions","In this study, I apply a quantile regression model to investigate how gold returns respond to changes in various financial indicators. The model quantifies the asymmetric response of gold return in the tails of the distribution based on weekly data over the past 30 years. I conducted a statistical test that allows for multiple structural changes and find that the relationship between gold return and some key financial indicators changed three times throughout the sample period. According to my empirical analysis of the whole sample period, I find that: (1) the gold return rises significantly if stock returns fall sharply; (2) it rises as the stock market volatility increases; (3) it also rises when general financial market conditions tighten; (4) gold and crude oil prices generally move toward the same direction; and (5) gold and the US dollar have an almost constant negative correlation. Looking at each sample period, (1) and (2) are remarkable in the period covering the global financial crisis (GFC), suggesting that investors divested from stocks as a risky asset. On the other hand, (3) is a phenomenon observed during the sample period after the GFC, suggesting that it reflects investors’ behavior of flight to quality.",2019-02-14,
"What drives food price volatility? Evidence based on a generalized VAR approach applied to the food, financial and energy markets","Abstract The aim of this study is to investigate sources of food prices volatility. The analysis uses daily series for volatility of corn, soybean, wheat, rice, US dollar, crude oil, and SP500 futures spanning the period January 4, 2000 to April 1, 2017. The authors employ the generalized vector autoregressive framework in rolling sample approach in order to capture the time-varying nature of volatility spillovers. The results reveal that: volatility spillovers measures change over time; most of the volatility spillovers are observed within the two groups of markets: food markets and “non-food” markets; corn market is net volatility transmitter.",2019-02-13,
The Role of Canceled Warrants in the LME Market,"This article visits the question of whether canceled warrants (CWs) have a positive effect on LME metal prices. To examine this question carefully, a regression model is applied. This paper finds a statistically significant positive link between CWs and LME metal prices, including aluminum, zinc, tin, and nickel. However, other metals such as copper and lead are not statistically significant. The second objective of the study is to identify the dynamic response of metal price returns for aluminum, zinc, tin, and nickel to an innovation in the CWs using VAR. It is found that the positive impact of the CWs on metal returns is transitory.",2019-02-12,
Time-Varying Impact of Geopolitical Risks on Oil Prices,"This paper analyses the dynamic impact of geopolitical risks (GPRs) on real oil returns for the period February 1974 to August 2017, using a time-varying parameter structural vector autoregressive (TVP-SVAR) model. Besides the two variables of concern, the model also includes growth in world oil production, global economic activity (to capture oil-demand), and world stock returns. We show that GPRs (based on a tally of newspaper articles covering geopolitical tensions), in general, has a significant negative impact on oil returns, primarily due to the decline in oil demand captured by the global economic activity. Our results, thus, highlight the risk of associating all GPRs with oil supply shocks driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and hence, ending up suggesting that higher GPRs drive up oil prices.",2019-01-28,
The Crude Oil–Stock Market Dependence and Its Determinants: Evidence from Emerging Economies,"This article uses dependence-switching copulas and time-varying single copulas to characterize the world oil–stock market dependence in a broad range of emerging economies, and it then conducts a regression analysis to explore the determinants of the market dependence patterns. Our results support a positive crude oil-emerging stock market link overall. The regression results show that oil return volatility, country-specific variables (i.e., stock market volatility, petroleum production growth), and US economic policy uncertainty have positive effects on the oil–stock dependence. However, a strong US economy tends to decrease the oil–stock dependence. The robustness of these findings is confirmed.",2019-01-24,
"Understanding Dynamic Conditional Correlations between Oil, Natural Gas and Non-Energy Commodity Futures Markets","We look at the dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs) between oil, natural gas and other non-energy commodity futures markets, obtained from a DCC-GARCH model over the period 1998-2014. They are positive and display a sharp increase around year 2008 and a subsequent decrease. The DCCs between energy and metals are larger than the energy-agriculture ones. To understand how macroeconomic and financial factors, as well as speculative activity, influence them, we estimate an ARDL(1,1) model, adopting a pooled mean group (PMG) estimator. We observe that macroeconomic and financial variables are significantly correlated with the energy-agriculture and energy-metals DCCs. Speculative activity contributes to explain the energy-agriculture DCCs but not those of the energy-metals.",2019-01-22,
The role of jumps in the agricultural futures market on forecasting stock market volatility: New evidence,"Abstract In this study, we explore the effect of cojumps within the agricultural futures market, and cojumps between the agricultural futures market and the stock market, on stock volatility forecasting. Also, we take into account large and small components of cojumps. We have several noteworthy findings. First, large jumps may lead to more substantial fluctuations and are more powerful than small jumps. The effect of cojumps and their decompositions on future volatility are mixed. Second, a model including large and small cojumps between the agricultural futures market and the stock market can achieve a higher forecasting accuracy, implying that large and small cojumps contain more useful predictive information than cojumps themselves. Third, our conclusions are robust based on various robustness tests such as the realized kernel, expanding forecasts, different forecasting windows, different jump tests, and different threshold values.",2019-01-09,
Volatility persistence and asymmetry under the microscope: the role of information demand for gold and oil,"Abstract This study explores the relationship between Google search activity and the conditional volatility of oil and gold spot market returns. By aggregating the volume of queries related to the two commodity markets in the spirit of Da et al . ( ), we construct a weekly Searching Volume Index (SVI) for each market as proxy of households and investors information demand. We employ a rolling EGARCH framework to reveal how the significance of information demand has evolved through time. We find that higher information demand increases conditional volatility in gold and oil spot market returns. Information flows from Google SVI's reduce the proportion of the significant volatility asymmetry produced by negative shocks in both commodity markets. The latter is more profound in the gold market.",2019-01-03,
Risk spillover effects of international crude oil market on China’s major markets,"This paper systematically evaluates the influence of international crude oil risk on Chinese macro-financial risks, by quantifying risk spillover effects from international crude oil market to China's three major markets (stock, foreign exchange and commodity markets). Specifically, this paper initially calculates the risks of international crude oil market and China's three major markets by adopting a conditional autoregressive value at risk (CAViaR) model, then the spillover index is used to capture the risk spillovers from international crude oil market to China's major markets. The empirical results indicate that there exists significant heterogeneous risk spillover effects transmitted from international crude oil market to China's three major markets. To be more specific, the risk derived from international crude oil market is always a dominant driving force of risk in China's commodity market. However, the shocks of global oil risk do not affect much of the risks of China's stock and foreign exchange markets in general. In addition, our results further report that international oil risk has considerable effects on China's macro-financial risks during several specific periods, which can be attributed to several major events. Specifically, the risk spillovers originated from international crude oil market remarkably contribute to the risk of China's commodity market during the period of global financial crisis. International crude oil risk makes great contribution to the risks of Chinese stock and foreign exchange markets, when several global notable events occur as well as major financial reforms in China are implemented. The empirical results have significant implications for policy-makers and market participants.",2019-01-01,
Passive Funds Actively Affect Prices: Evidence from the Largest ETF Markets,"This paper studies exchange-traded funds’ (ETFs) price impact in the most ETF-dominatedasset classes: volatility (VIX) and commodities. I propose a model-independent approach to replicate the VIX futures contract. This allows me to isolate a non-fundamental component in VIX futures prices that is strongly related to the rebalancing of ETFs. To understand the source of that component, I decompose trading demand from ETFs into three parts: leverage rebalancing, calendar rebalancing, and flow rebalancing. Leverage rebalancing has the largest effects. It amplifies price changes and exposes ETF counterparties negatively to variance.",2019-01-01,
Oil Futures Volatility and the Economy,"To assess the economic determinants of oil futures volatility, we firstly develop and estimate a multi-factor oil futures pricing model with stochastic volatility that is able to disentangle long-term, medium-term and short-term variations in commodity markets volatility. The volatility estimates reveal that in line with theory, the volatility factors are unspanned, persistent and carry negative market price of risk, while crude oil markets are becoming more integrated with financial markets. After 2004, short-term volatility is driven by industrial production, term and credit spreads, the S&P 500 and the US dollar index, along with the traditional drivers including hedging pressure and VIX. Medium-term volatility is consistently related to open interest and credit spreads, while after 2004 oil sector variables such as inventory and consumption also impact this part of the term structure. Interest rates mostly matter for long-term futures price volatility.",2019-01-01,
The Impact of Speculation on Commodity Prices: A Meta-Granger Analysis,"This paper uses Meta-Granger analysis to explain and summarize the mixed results in the literature on the impact of financial speculation on commodity prices. The sample covers 2,106 manually collected p-values from Granger causality (GC) tests reported in 54 prior studies. Our results show that the heterogeneity in previous findings can be largely explained by the commodity type under examination, sample period of the data, the measurement of the focus variables (return, volatility or spread), and the inclusion of control variables in the GC model. Even after accounting for 23 observable differences in study and test design, our results indicate that studies published in higher ranked journals present significantly less evidence for speculation to drive commodity prices. Moreover, we use the Meta-Granger results to predict 'best choice' models considering preferred model setups. The results reveal that the hypothesis of Granger non-causality between speculation and commodity prices cannot be rejected at standard significance levels when assuming a best choice study design and various variations of it. We conclude that either there is no genuine overall speculation effect in agricultural, energy and metal markets, or the research design of the frequently applied GC testing is not powerful enough to detect those effects.",2019-01-01,
Is the Supply Curve for Commodity Futures Contracts Upward Sloping?,"Annual rebalancing of the S&P GSCI index provides a novel and strong identification to estimate the shape of supply curves for commodity futures contracts. Using the 24 commodities included in the S&P GSCI for 2004–2017, we show that cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) reach a peak of 59 basis points in the middle of the week following the rebalancing period, but the impact is temporary as it declines to near zero within the next week. The findings provide clear evidence that the supply curve for commodity futures contracts is upward sloping in the short-run but almost flat in the longer-run.",2019-01-01,
Commodity Convexity,"We propose a novel measure, namely relative basis, as a more precise proxy for theconvenience yield implied by the Theory of Storage. The relative basis, defined as thedifference between the traditional near-term basis and a similarly defined longer-termbasis, purges out the interference from the storage cost and financing cost. The relativebasis dominates the traditional basis in terms of predicting subsequent commodityfutures returns. In contrast, it cannot predict the returns of financial futures that haveno inventory concern. Additional analysis further confirms that the return predictabilityof relative basis in commodity markets comes from the Theory of Storage instead of theTheory of Normal Backwardation.",2019-01-01,
Causality in Quantiles and Dynamic Relations in Energy Markets,"In this paper we investigate the dynamic relations between crude oil price returns and a set of energy price returns, namely diesel, gasoline, heating, and the natural gas. This is performed by means of Granger non-causality tests for US spot closing prices over the period from January 1997 to December 2017. In previous studies this has been done by testing for the added predictive value of including lagged values of one energy price return in predicting the conditional expectation of another. In this paper, we instead focus on different ranges of the full conditional distribution within the framework of a dynamic quantile regression model, and identify the quantile ranges from which causality arises. The results constitute a richer set of findings than what is possible by just considering a single moment of the conditional distribution, which can be useful for implementing better substitution investment strategies and effective policy interventions. We find several interesting one-directional dynamic relations between the employed energy prices, especially in the tail quantiles, but also a bi-directional causal relation between energy prices for which the classical Granger non-causality test suggests otherwise. Our results are robust to alternative measures of the price of oil and different data frequencies.",2019-01-01,
The First Commodity Futures Index of 1933,"We document the properties of the first diversified commodity futures index introduced by the Dow Jones Company in 1933, and use its live track record to study the properties of the asset class in an experimental setting that does not suffer from backfill, selection, or survivorship biases. Despite the setbacks posed by contract failure and trading suspensions of several index constituents, the index appreciated by 3.7% per year between 1933 and 1998, while an investment in collateralized front-month futures returned 4.5% in excess of the risk-free rate. We quantify the impact of trading suspensions and contract failure on the estimates of the risk premium.",2019-01-01,
QUANTIFYING THE ANNOUNCEMENT EFFECTS IN THE U.S. LUMBER MARKET,"The impact of public reports on price fluctuations has been widely investigated in many commodity markets, but little attention has been paid to the lumber market. In this thesis, we examine the impact of two housing market reports, namely the New Residential Construction (Housing Starts) and the New Residential Sales reports, on the U.S. lumber futures market. Our results suggest that the housing starts report does indeed affect lumber market volatility, while the New Residential sales report exerts a minor impact on lumber price volatility. Price volatility is measured by changes future contract prices for lumber. We further find that the effect of the two reports on volatility differs depending on the level of lumber inventory and the nature of the news. When inventory is low, larger-than-expected housing starts have the largest effect on lumber volatility. During periods of abundant inventory, lower-than-expected housing starts increase the volatility most. For the new home sales reports, we find that while lower-than-expected sales do not affect the volatility of lumber prices, larger-than-expected sales do increase the volatility.",2019-01-01,
Evaluating the Portfolio Rebalancing Hypothesis in the Presence of the International Goods Market,"A relatively recent approach to examining the currency-equity return relationship argues that the portfolio rebalancing activities of investors gives rise to an Uncovered Equity Parity condition (UEP), whereby higher relative equity returns in one country are associated with a currency depreciation as international investors re-jig positions to maintain optimal portfolio targets. Motivated by evidence that the UEP does not hold for large commodity exporters of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, this paper examines the impact the commodity market has on the currency and equity market interaction by applying a latent factor model designed to distinguish between comovement and spillovers. In order to contextualise the results, the same model is estimated for a sample of three benchmark OECD countries comprising Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The evidence is not supportive of the UEP for either country group, and there is particularly strong evidence of positive feedback between currency and equity markets for the benchmark OECD group. More generally, there are significant interconnections between all three asset markets for both the large commodity exporters and the benchmark OECD countries. This is unsurprising given that commodity prices play a role in transmitting demand and supply shocks to asset markets, and are also increasingly connected to traditional asset markets as a result of evolving investor behaviour.",2019-01-01,
Finansyzacja gospodarki w teorii i praktyce. Pomyśleć kapitalizm od nowa,"Finansyzacja przynależy do tej kategorii zjawisk ekonomicznych, które niczym w soczewce skupiają w sobie największe słabości współczesnego systemu kapitalistycznego (wśród nich m.in. krótkowzroczność inwestorów, inflację aktywów na rynkach kapitałowych, bezprecedensową skalę nierówności dochodowych i majątkowych, postępujący wzrost zadłużenia tak indywidualnych podmiotów, jak i całych państw czy wreszcie niestabilność systemu finansowego). Co więcej, w procesie finansyzacji nastąpiło redefiniowanie ekonomicznej roli sektora finansowego w gospodarce.

Stanowią one jednocześnie przesłankę do podjęcia rozważań na temat zasadności, a być może nieuchronnej konieczności, przywrócenia historycznie ugruntowanej roli sektora finansowego w gospodarce, co w niektórych przypadkach wiązać się może z przeprowadzeniem procesu definansyzacji.",2019-01-01,
Modelling gold futures: should the level of speculation inform our choice of variables?,"Prior literature provides conflicting evidence about the impact of speculation on gold futures returns, volatility, and the relationship between market fundamentals and prices. In this paper, we exploit trade volume information to determine the most appropriate family of factors to adopt when modelling gold futures. Using the Disaggregated Commitment of Traders report, we find that extreme levels of speculation are informative in that they signify a shift in the relative modelling accuracy of macroeconomic and latent factors. A simple composite prediction framework, incorporating the changing level of speculation, empirically demonstrates the uncovered phenomenon and offers improved predictive accuracy for gold futures prices. Furthermore, our findings are shown to be robust to alternative latent and macroeconomic model specifications.",2018-12-17,
Analysis of Oil Market Trends Post-2000,"This paper aims to analyse changes in the oil market during the ""third oil price shock"" in 2007 and 2008.It is particularly important to investigate the influence of disruptions in oil production (in both OPEC and non-OPEC countries) on crude oil prices and consumption.The authors conduct an empirical investigation of this problem, estimating a vector error correction model and an impulse-response function.Based on the empirical data, we noticed that from 2004 to 2008 the growth in oil demand was not compensated by an appropriate increase in oil production.The results of impulse-response functions show that, with the improvement in global demand, we should rather expect OPEC production to increase.Moreover, this kind of reaction in OPEC is delayed by about four months, which can be explained by the restrictions on OPEC's spare capacity.This limits the room for a short-term increase in OPEC production.Unexpected demand shocks or price innovations increase the level of both OPEC and non-OPEC production, but the response of OPEC is more significant.These findings may be considered as a point of departure for future analyses of OPEC production adjustments.",2018-12-07,
The Economic Impact of Index Investing,"Abstract We study the impact of index investing on firm performance by examining the link between commodity indices and firms that use index commodities. Around 2004, commodity index investing dramatically increased. This event is referred to as the financialization of commodity markets. Following financialization, firms that use index commodities make worse production decisions, earn 40% lower profits, and have 6% higher costs. Consistent with a feedback channel in which market participants learn from prices, our results suggest that index investing distorts the price signal, thereby generating a negative externality that impedes firms’ ability to make production decisions.

Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.",2018-12-06,
When will food price bubbles burst? A review,"This paper examines whether there are multiple explosive bubble episodes in international food market by employing the Generalised Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test. This method is particularly suitable for practical application of time series and provides an innovative consistent date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of bubble episodes. Our results show that there are four explosive bubble episodes mostly accompanied by huge price volatilities during 1990-2017, which is largely in line with the asset pricing model (Gürkaynak 2008). The exuberance and collapse of bubble episodes can be explained by imbalance between supply and demand, depreciation of U.S. dollar, financial crisis and speculation. Our findings also provide supporting evidence for the Masters hypothesis that tremendous buying pressure from index investments contributes to substantial bubble episodes. The authorities should accurately identify bubble episode and monitor its evolving process, which is propitious to achieve the effective stabilisation of global food system. Particularly, restrictions on excessive speculative trading should be arranged under extreme market situations in order to forestall the explosion of multiple food bubbles.",2018-12-04,
Speculation and volatility—A time‐varying approach applied on Chinese commodity futures markets,"Experts have long discussed and empirically investigated whether speculative activity increases volatility on commodity futures markets. Little empirical research, however, analyzes the role of speculators on commodity futures markets in China. Using time‐varying vector autoregression models with stochastic volatility, this paper investigates for four heavily traded metal and agricultural contracts, how the relationship between returns volatility and speculation evolves over time. Our findings indicate that speculative activity has little to no impact on volatility. On the contrary, for all commodities examined, returns volatility seems to amplify speculation.",2018-11-26,
Is Commodity Index Investing Profitable?,"Using a comprehensive dataset of first-, second-, and third-generation commodity indices, we investigate the potential diversification benefits in equity-bond portfolios. The results show that first-generation commodity indices are outperformed by enhanced indices. Second-generation indices provide slightly increased portfolio Sharpe ratios but at the same time they are spanned by benchmark assets. For third-generation commodity indices, the mean-variance spanning hypothesis is rejected but they show heterogenous out-of-sample performances. We thus present new evidence showing that the performance of the third-generation of commodity indices is less clear-cut than found in existing studies. <b>TOPICS:</b>Commodities, passive strategies, performance measurement",2018-11-19,
The predictive power of log-likelihood of GARCH volatility,"Purpose This paper aims to investigate whether the best statistical model also corresponds to the best empirical performance in the volatility modeling of financialized commodity markets. Design/methodology/approach The authors use various p and q values in Value-at-Risk (VaR) GARCH(p, q) estimation and perform backtesting at different confidence levels, different out-of-sample periods and different data frequencies for eight financialized commodities. Findings They find that the best fitted GARCH(p,q) model tends to generate the best empirical performance for most financialized commodities. Their findings are consistent at different confidence levels and different out-of-sample periods. However, the strong results occur for both daily and weekly returns series. They obtain weak results for the monthly series. Research limitations/implications Their research method is limited to the GARCH(p,q) model and the eight discussed financialized commodities. Practical implications They conclude that they should continue to rely on the log-likelihood statistical criteria for choosing a GARCH(p,q) model in financialized commodity markets for daily and weekly forecasting horizons. Social implications The log-likelihood statistical criterion has strong predictive power in GARCH high-frequency data series (daily and weekly). This finding justifies the importance of using statistical criterion in financial market modeling. Originality/value First, this paper investigates whether the best statistical model corresponds to the best empirical performance. Second, this paper provides an indirect test for evaluating the accuracy of volatility modeling by using the VaR approach.",2018-11-13,
The Lead–Lag Relationship between Oil Futures and Spot Prices—A Literature Review,"Crude oil is the dominant energy resource worldwide. The focus of this paper is on its historical behaviour and subsequent implications for the global economy with an emphasis on the lead–lag relationship between spot and future prices. The paper examines the behaviour of oil spot and future prices and their determinants during periods of market uncertainty, particularly in the context of economic and financial crises. The analysis highlights a key controversy within the extant literature, as to whether spot or futures prices are the main crude oil price indicator. The literature review indicates that the lead–lag relationship is a dynamic one, especially during periods of sustained uncertainty, which leads to significant disagreements and incongruities among researchers regarding the price that plays a dominant role.",2018-10-31,
Volatility Spillovers Arising from the Financialization of Commodities,"This paper examines whether the proliferation of new index products, such as commodity-tracking exchange-traded funds (ETFs), amplified the volatility transmission channel introduced by financialization. This paper focuses on the volatility spillover effects among crude oil, metals, agriculture, and non-energy commodity markets. The results show financialization has an impact on the volatility of commodity prices, predominantly for non-energy commodities. However, the impact on volatility is not symmetric across all commodities. The analysis of index investment and investors’ positions in futures markets shows that, when a relationship exists, it is generally negatively correlated with the realized volatility of non-energy commodities. Using realized volatility in the difference-in-difference model provides estimates that are inconsistent with other findings that non-energy commodities, traded as a part of indices, have experienced higher volatility. The results are similar to the index investment and futures market analysis, where increased participation by investors through new investment products has put download pressure on realized volatility.",2018-10-27,
Basis‐Momentum,"ABSTRACT We introduce a return predictor related to the slope and curvature of the futures term structure: basis‐momentum. Basis‐momentum strongly outperforms benchmark characteristics in predicting commodity spot and term premiums in both the time series and the cross section. Exposure to basis‐momentum is priced among commodity‐sorted portfolios and individual commodities. We argue that basis‐momentum captures imbalances in the supply and demand of futures contracts that materialize when the market‐clearing ability of speculators and intermediaries is impaired, and that it represents compensation for priced risk. Our findings are inconsistent with alternative explanations based on storage, inventory, and hedging pressure.",2018-10-25,
Factor Structure in Commodity Futures Return and Volatility,"We uncover stylized facts of commodity futures’ price and volatility dynamics in the post-financialization period and find a factor structure in daily commodity volatility that is much stronger than the factor structure in returns. The common factor in commodity volatility relates to stock market volatility as well as to the business cycle. Model-free realized commodity betas with the stock market were high during 2008–2010 but have since returned to the pre-crisis level, close to 0. While commodity markets appear segmented from the equity market when considering only returns, commodity volatility indicates a nontrivial degree of market integration.",2018-08-28,
Hedging systematic risk in the commodity market with a regime‐switching multivariate rotated generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model,"Abstract In this paper, a regime‐switching multivariate rotated BEKK generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH; RS‐MRBEKK) model for optimal futures hedging is proposed. The basic structure of the RS‐MRBEKK model is to rotate returns with spectral decomposition and fit the rotated returns with a Markov regime‐switching BEKK covariance structure that is computationally attractive for modeling higher‐dimensional regime‐switching GARCH dynamics. The empirical results reveal that adding additional commodity index futures to capture the commodity price comovement under regime switching improves hedging performance. The more parsimonious RS‐MRBEKK is statistically no worse than the conventional nonrotated regime‐switching BEKK, illustrating the usefulness of RS‐MRBEKK in higher‐dimensional hedging applications.",2018-08-13,
Calibration of the exponential Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process when spot prices are visible through the maximum log-likelihood method. Example with gold prices,"The purpose of this paper is to present a methodological procedure to estimate the parameters of the exponential Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, also known as the Schwartz (J. Finance 52(3):923–973, 1997) one-factor model, in situations where the spot price of the commodity is observable. The proposal consists of looking at the probability function of the process as a function of the unknown parameters in discrete time, known as the likelihood function. Then the logarithm of that expression is calculated as it is easier to work with it. Finally, the problem of determining the values of the parameters that maximize the sum of the individual log-likelihoods (joint log-likelihood function) is solved to obtain the estimation equations explicitly. In that sense, this work is relevant because as spot prices are available, it is possible to estimate the parameters directly without the necessity of using more elaborate approaches like the Kalman filter. Finally, the paper applies this methodology to the concrete case of one precious metal that has an observable spot price and for which some empirical and theoretical studies suggest that it presents a mean-reverting pattern, gold. The estimated parameters are consistent with previous works and with the original data and the least squares method.",2018-08-07,
Volatility and correlation timing: The role of commodities,"This paper examines the role of commodities from the perspective of dynamic asset allocation. We model conditional second moments of stock, bond, and commodity futures and examine their impact on the portfolio choice decision of a risk‐averse investor in a mean‐variance framework. Findings suggest that adding commodities in the opportunity set enhances portfolio risk‐return characteristics and offers diversification benefits. Moreover, there is substantial economic value in both volatility and correlation timing strategies. Results are robust across various subperiods and rebalancing strategies: alternative correlation dynamics specifications, short‐sale constraints, and transaction costs under both in‐ and out‐of‐sample settings.",2018-06-29,
Why Is the Correlation between Crude Oil Prices and the US Dollar Exchange Rate Time-Varying?—Explanations Based on the Role of Key Mediators,"Using DCC-GARCH model, this paper finds that, since 1990, the relationship between crude oil prices and the US dollar index is time-varying, demonstrating a process of ‘very weak correlation—negative correlation—enhanced negative correlation—weakening negative correlation’, but the existing research does not provide enough reasonable explanation. Therefore, this paper proposed a ‘key mediating factors’ hypothesis which points out that whether there is a common ‘key mediating factor’ is important source of the time-varying relationship between two assets. We argue that market trend and financial market sentiment undertook the role of ‘key mediating factor’ during the period of the 2002 to the financial crisis and financial crisis to 2013, while other periods lack the ‘key mediating factors’.",2018-06-25,

"An Empirical Analysis of the Relationships between Crude Oil,Gold and Stock Markets","Oil and gold are used as investment assets and so they are closely related to the evolution of stock market indices, given that any influence on decisions about investment portfolios can affect stock market returns. Consequently, it is important for investors to analyze the direction of influence between crude oil, gold and stock markets when designing and implementing their investment strategies.Thus, this paper studies the direction of the causality among the three markets for the US case. In doing so, we apply linear and non-linear Granger causality tests for daily data from the Great Moderation onwards. Evidence is provided as to the importance of considering the possibility of nonlinear relationships between the three markets, a feature which cannot be revealed using conventional linear causality tests which would therefore lead to an information loss about the true link.The results for the full sample indicate that the causality goes in all directions, which implies that changes in the stock market returns may be monitored by observing changes in the returns of the two commodity markets considered (and vice versa). This may help to design substitution investment strategies. The results also indicate that the direction of influence between markets does not exhibit material differences between various subsamples, with the exception of the causality relationship between the two commodity markets. This may in part help explain the contradictory results and mixed conclusions found in previous related literature.",2018-06-01,
Speculation and corn prices,"It is commonly asserted that speculative trading activities are largely behind the high and volatile food commodity price behaviour since 2006. In this article, we revisit this hypothesis by investigating how different speculative measures affect our conclusion on the role of speculation. Four speculative measures are considered, including index trading activities, non-commercial net long positions, Working's speculative index, and an excessive speculative volume index. These four measures imply different underlying hypotheses about the role of speculation on commodity price movements and encompass most of the measures used in the recent literature on the role of speculation in commodity markets. Using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model, we show a mixed impact of speculative trading on corn prices depending on the measure used. While shocks to index trading activities and excess speculation as measured by Working's T have either zero or negative impact on corn prices, a positive shock to non-commercial net positions or the Tadesse index significantly increases the price of corn. However, the magnitude of the impact is not large, at most about $0.30 per bushel in real terms. Our findings are robust to structural breaks, alternative ordering of variables, and an alternative specification of the model.",2018-04-26,
Equities and Commodities Comovements: Evidence from Emerging Markets,"The financialization of commodities and their inclusion in financial portfolios as part of an investment strategy may result in higher correlations and volatility spillovers between commodity and equity markets. In this paper, we estimate the correlation between equity markets and commodities using the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model, while emphasizing the differences between emerging and developed markets co-movements with commodities. The results reveal that certain emerging markets, especially those in Asia, show a much lower level of co-movement with commodities than developed markets do, while Latin American equities exhibit a higher level of integration with commodities. Furthermore, it is found that both agricultural and precious metals commodities offer better diversification possibilities in the less developed markets. We also find that increases in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) are related to higher agriculture commodities-equities correlations, while commodity net index investment has limited explanatory power in our study.",2018-04-26,
Including commodity futures in asset allocation in China,"In this paper, we investigate the role of eight commodity futures in asset allocation in China during the period January 2004–December 2015. The Chinese commodities and stocks are moderately correlated. We use quantile regressions based on a value-at-risk model to examine the relation between these two markets. We find no risk spillovers between the markets, suggesting that stocks and commodities in China are exposed to different risks. Using different asset allocation strategies, we show that including soymeal and soybeans in the Chinese stock index can offer some diversification gains. However, other Chinese commodities may not be useful for portfolio diversification.",2018-04-23,
Return and volatility co-movement in commodity futures markets: the effects of liquidity risk,"Commodity markets are a widely researched topic in the field of finance. In this paper, we investigate the co-movement of return and volatility measures in different commodity futures markets and how these measures are affected by liquidity risk. First, we find that commodity returns display co-movement and that liquidity risk plays a key role in shaping asset return patterns. Moreover, we show that the volatilities of commodity returns co-move, and we demonstrate the role of liquidity risk in this joint pattern. We also find that the commodity markets we investigated share a common volatility factor that determines their joint volatility co-movement. Because liquidity risk affects both commodity returns and volatility shocks, it might be interpreted as the common causal factor driving both measures simultaneously. Therefore, we affirm the view that liquidity shocks are firmly related to two residual risks originating from both market return and market volatility. Finally, we also show that liquidity spillovers can significantly drive cross-sectional correlation dynamics.",2018-04-23,
Does news uncertainty matter for commodity futures markets? Heterogeneity in energy and non‐energy sectors,"This study investigates the impact of news implied volatility (NVIX) and its two sub‐components (news about stock markets, SMI, and news about banks and other financial intermediaries, FII) on the long‐term volatilities of commodity futures. Our empirical results clearly show that NVIX behaves heterogeneously in energy and non‐energy sectors. NVIX exerts a positively significant influence on volatilities of non‐energy futures. By contrast, volatilities of energy futures cannot be triggered by NVIX. We further show that SMI significantly affects both energy and non‐energy futures, whereas, FII only impacts non‐energy futures.",2018-04-02,

"Price Change, Volatility, and Accurate VaR: <i>Evidence from the NSW and QLD Power Markets</i>","This article investigates the relationship among price changes, volatility forecasts, and accurate Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimates in power markets. The authors use various GARCH(p,q) methods to model daily volatility and estimate VaR in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD) regions. Then, they explore the relationship among price changes, and volatility forecasts and accurate VaRs for both generator and retailer sides, at 99 percent, 95 percent and 90 percent VaR confidence levels in six different out-of-sample periods. They find that forecasted volatility and accurate VaR variables tend to be statistically significant in explaining variations in power price changes. They also find that the coefficients of forecasted volatility tend to be negative. This indicates that higher forecasted volatility predicts negative price changes. Therefore, market participants in power markets, either generator or retailer, should expect a negative price change when their volatility forecast is high. Furthermore, the authors find that accurate VaR tends to lead to a decrease in price changes. This implies that well-functioning market risk management explains an unfavorable price change for the generator, but a favorable price change for the retailer in the Australian power markets. <b>TOPICS:</b>Commodities, developed, VAR and use of alternative risk measures of trading risk, statistical methods",2018-03-27,
Testing Efficiency of the London Metal Exchange: New Evidence,"This paper explores the market efficiency of the six base metals traded on the LME (London Metal Exchange) using daily data from January 2000 to June 2016. The hypothesis that futures prices 3M (3-month) are unbiased predictors of spot prices (cash) in the LME is rejected based on the false premise that the financialization of commodities has been growing. For the robustness check, monthly data is analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and GARCH (1,1) models. We reject the null hypothesis for all metals except for zinc.",2018-03-14,
Financialization and Global Commodity Chains: Distributional Implications for Cotton in Sub‐Saharan Africa,"ABSTRACT Restructuring of global and local markets has led to an increased influence of commodity derivatives markets on commodity price setting. This has critical implications for price risks experienced by actors along commodity chains. Commodity derivatives markets have undergone significant changes that have been referred to as the ‘financialization of commodities’, which we define as an increase in trading activity by financial investors and the reorientation of business strategies by commodity trading houses towards risk management and financial activities. This article assesses how these global financialization processes affect commodity producers in low‐income countries via the operational dynamics of global commodity chains and national market structures. It investigates how prices are set and transmitted and how risks are distributed and managed in the cotton sectors in Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Tanzania. It concludes that uneven exposure to price instability and access to price risk management have important distributional implications. Whilst international traders have the capacity to deal with price risks through hedging, in addition to expanding their profit possibilities through financial activities on derivatives markets, local actors in producing countries face the challenge of increased short‐termism — albeit to different extents depending on national market structures — with limited access to risk management.",2018-03-10,
The components of the bid‐ask spread: Evidence from the corn futures market,"Abstract This article examines whether USDA announcements and commodity index fund rolling activity have an impact on liquidity costs, measured by the bid‐ask spread. Using Huang and Stoll's (1997) model of liquidity costs, we estimate whether changes to liquidity costs are driven by its adverse selection, inventory, or order processing components. Commodity index fund roll activity reduces the asymmetric information cost component of liquidity cost due to an increased proportion of noninformation‐based trading, but the inventory cost component increases as (mostly long only) commodity index funds sell their nearby positions and buy the first deferred contract—raising liquidity providers’ risk of building a position. The sum of these two effects is that liquidity costs remain low during index fund roll periods, averaging one “tick” (0.25 cents). On USDA report release days, we find that informed traders raise the asymmetric information component of liquidity costs in the first hour after release, but the inventory cost component is reduced due to the increase in volume. Similar to index fund roll activity, liquidity costs on USDA report release days remain low, averaging one “tick”. Our findings that liquidity costs are minimally changed during USDA report releases and commodity index fund roll periods is consistent with other recent research on liquidity costs, but we show that what drives liquidity costs differs substantially depending on the circumstances surrounding daily trading.",2018-03-05,
EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OIL AND PRECIOUS METALS MARKETS,"The relationship between crude oil and precious metals has been a major issue in economic and financial literature. In this paper, the FIEGARCH-copula framework was used to investigate the co-movements not only between returns, but also between volatilities and market risks among crude oil and precious metals markets. Based on daily crude oil and the major precious metals prices from January 2, 2000 to December 31, 2016, our empirical results are as follows: First, a significant positive and asymmetric relationship between oil and precious metals returns, volatilities and market risk was detected. Second, the dependence structure between oil-silver and oil-gold for returns and volatilities are time varying, while the other pairs are characterized by constant dependence. Third, based on the dependence modeling between daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) for the long and short trading position, empirical results show that the market risk relationship between crude oil and precious metals change over time and increase with VaR’s confidence level. Our findings are of interest for investors and risk managers in portfolio’s design and allow for a reliable framework for returns and risk prediction.",2018-03-01,
THE DETERMINANTS OF A SIMULTANEOUS CRASH IN GOLD AND STOCK MARKETS: AN ORDERED LOGIT APPROACH,"In this study, we identify the determinants of a simultaneous crash in gold and stock markets by employing an ordered logit model. We find that a default spread, among the various financial risk indicators, is a valid determinant and that changes in investors’ beliefs, their uncertainties, and surprise changes in these uncertainties about gold and stock markets contain useful information for explaining the occurrence of a simultaneous crash in the two markets. Further, we recognize that the effect of some covariates on crash probability is state-dependent. In addition to these empirical results, a notable finding is that the occurrence of a crash in one market on a previous day does not raise the probability of the occurrence of a crash in another market the next day, implying that a joint crash occurs abruptly and not in a chain reaction. This finding reveals that diversification to gold is still beneficial to investors.",2018-03-01,
Cross-herding behavior between the stock market and the crude oil market during financial distress,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate herding behavior around the crude oil market and the stock market and the possible cross-herding behavior between the two markets. The analysis examines also the herding behavior during financial turmoil and includes the investor sentiment and market volatility. Design/methodology/approach The authors use a modified version of the cross-sectional standard deviation and the cross-sectional absolute deviation to include investor sentiment, financial crisis and market volatility. Findings The authors find that the volatility of the stock market reduces the herding behavior around the oil market and boosts that around the stock market. However, the investors’ sentiment reduces the herding around the stock market and boosts that around the crude oil market. Consequently, the authors can conclude that the herding behavior around the two markets moves inversely and the herding in each market is enhanced by the lack of information in the other market. Research limitations/implications This paper is limited to the herding of stocks around the crude oil market and ignores the possible herding of commodities around the oil market. Originality/value The originality of the paper rests on the study of the possible cross-herding behavior between the oil market and the stock market especially during financial turmoil.",2018-02-21,
Properties of Long/Short Commodity Indices in Stock and Bond Portfolios,"Over the past two decades, commodity-linked products have become increasingly popular as an alternative asset class for many investors. This is mainly because long positions in commodities potentially offer diversification benefits in portfolios comprising other more traditional assets. Commodities also arguably provide equity-like returns and act as an inflation hedge. However, there is an ongoing debate concerning long-only positions in commodities as an adequate investment vehicle, especially given observed low or negative returns and increased correlation with other more common asset classes, as given periodically. The purpose of this article is to analyze the performance effects of including long/short commodity indices in more conventional stock–bond portfolios using out-of-sample tests over different periods and by employing different asset allocation strategies. Overall, the author identifies benefits of commodity inclusion from 2002 to 2011, but these benefits largely disappear from 2011 to 2015. An intriguing finding is that Henriksen observes a much lower risk–adjusted performance for the commodity indices after their launch date. <b>TOPICS:</b>Commodities, security analysis and valuation, fixed income and structured finance, portfolio construction",2018-02-19,
Foreign Exchange Speculation: An Event Study,"Does speculation facilitate price discovery or instability? If it is price discovery, it is beneficial and should be encouraged; if it is instability, welfare is enhanced by its reduction. This paper seeks to distinguish between these two characteristics by analysing those times when speculation in the foreign exchange market is most extreme. A series of event studies are conducted on the extremes of speculative sentiment and speculative activity. If speculation is noise, extreme sentiment and extreme positions should lead to overshooting and increase risk of subsequent reversals. The finding that speculative extremes do not provide information about subsequent returns implies that speculation is part of the process of price discovery and that efforts to reduce it would reduce the informational efficiency of financial markets.",2018-02-17,
Volatility Transmission between Oil and LME Futures,"This paper investigates the volatility transmission between oil and base metals to assess the possibility of hedge strategy across commodity markets. In order to identify the volatility linkage of oil to the base metals, the bivariate GARCH model is applied using daily returns data period over 2000-2016. It is found that evidence of volatility transmission between oil and base metals is somewhat strong with a 1% significant level.

Financialization and Commodity Market Serial Dependence,"Recent financialization in commodity markets makes it easier for institutional investors to trade a portfolio of commodities via various commodity-indexed products. We present novel causal evidence that exposure to such index trading results in negative daily return autocorrelations among commodities in that index.

We present direct evidence for such noise propagation using commodity news sentiment data.",2018-01-01,
Dynamics of Arbitrage,"We study the dynamics of cash-and-carry arbitrage using the U.S. crude oil market. Sizable arbitrage-related inventory movements occur at the NYMEX futures contract delivery point but not at other storage locations where, instead, operational factors explain most inventory changes. We add to the Theory of Storage literature by introducing two new features. First, due to arbitrageurs contracting ahead, inventories respond to not only contemporaneous but also lagged futures spreads. Second, storage capacity limits can impede cash-and-carry arbitrage, implying that apparent arbitrage opportunities are not exploitable and can persist. Our findings suggest that arbitrage-induced inventory movements are, on average, price stabilizing.",2018-01-01,
Forecasting Commodity Futures Returns: An Economic Value Analysis of Macroeconomic vs. Specific Factors,"We test whether three well-known commodity-specific variables (basis, hedging pressure, and momentum) may improve the predictive power for commodity futures returns of models otherwise based on macroeconomic factors. We compute recursive, out-of-sample forecasts for fifteen monthly commodity futures return series, when estimation is based on a stepwise model selection approach under a probability-weighted regime-switching regression that identifies different volatility regimes. Comparisons with an AR(1) benchmark show that the inclusion of commodity-specific factors does not improve the forecasting power. We perform a back-testing exercise of a mean-variance investment strategy that exploits any predictability of the conditional risk premium of commodities, stocks, and bond returns, also taking into account transaction costs caused by portfolio rebalancing. The risk-adjusted performance of this strategy does not allow us to conclude that any forecasting approach outperforms the others. However, there is evidence that investment strategies based on commodity-specific predictors outperform the remaining strategies in the high-volatility state.",2018-01-01,
Trade Flows and Retail Investor Impacts in Commodity Futures Markets,"Using intraday data, we document a statistically strong, but temporary, association between commodity-index trader flows and commodity futures prices. Reexamining the positive returns associated with the issuance of commodity-linked notes documented by Henderson, Pearson, and Wang (2015), we find that these returns are too large to be explained by the small trades necessary to hedge these notes, and provide new evidence that they are instead the result of endogenous issuance. Our results provide novel support for commodity financialization, but highlight the importance of measuring the magnitude of financial investment, since even large financial flows have economically modest impacts on prices.",2018-01-01,

The analysis shows that derivatives markets have a long history and have facilitated trading across time and geographical areas. The results of a quasi-experiment conducted for Japan and the US reveal that commodity price fluctuations were higher before the establishment of futures markets. The analysis further indicates that the unprecedented inflow of liquidity in derivatives markets was mainly facilitated by the deregulation policies adopted in the US, EU and elsewhere and was intensified by an increasing interest of investors in alternative asset classes. In the new millennium many product innovations flooded the market, reducing transparency and increasing market uncertainty. The study indicates that improved data quality and quantity are necessary conditions to enhance the understanding of derivatives markets. In addition, a sound legal and financial system is a must for thriving financial markets. Such a system creates a framework of checks and balances for the market, it contributes significantly to meaningful regulations and vibrant policies and helps to prevent or eradicate market manipulations.",2018-01-01,
The Role of Financial Investors on Commodity Futures Risk Premium,"I develop and test a model to study the interaction between the commodity and stock markets. This study attempts to clarify the debate about the effect of financialization on commodity markets. Theoretically, the futures risk premium is determined by hedging pressure, stock market returns, and the commodity-equity correlation. Empirically, the effect of the stock market on the energy market became significantly greater for the futures risk premium in the period following the 2008 crisis. Furthermore, hedging pressure is a strong explanatory variable for the futures risk premium in various circumstances.",2018-01-01,

Diversification and Financialization in Commodity Markets: Evidence from Commodity Trading Advisors,"This paper provides new and integrated evidence on the causes and consequences of commodity financialization from the perspective of diversification. First, based on a large sample of commodity trading advisors, we find that financial investment in commodity markets is related to the diversification benefits against stock market downturns. Second, the aggregate financial investment positively predicts future commodity-stock return correlation. Finally, using terrorist attacks as shocks to diversification need, we present causal evidence that diversification-motivated investment in commodity markets increases the commodity-stock market comovement. Overall, our findings reveal the economic link between diversification benefits, commodity financialization, and the commodity-stock market comovement.",2018-01-01,
Asset Prices in Segmented and Integrated Markets,"This paper evaluates the effect of market integration on prices and welfare, in a model where two Lucas trees grow in separate regions with similar investors. We find equilibrium asset price dynamics and welfare both in segmentation, when each region holds its own asset and consumes its dividend, and in integration, when both regions trade both assets and consume both dividends. Integration always increases welfare. Asset prices may increase or decrease, depending on the time of integration, but decrease on average. Correlation in assetsâ€™ returns is zero or negative before integration, but significantly positive afterwards, explaining some effects commonly associated with financialization.",2018-01-01,
Analyzing the Structural Transformation of Commodity Markets: Financialization Revisited,"The first decade of the 21st century saw wide fluctuations in commodity prices and a massively increased participation of financial investors in the commodity derivatives markets. The investigation of whether the presence of financial investors was responsible for these fluctuations - and, more in general, whether large trades affected futures and spot prices - has yielded mixed results in the literature. We take up this question by linking financialization to the ongoing structural transformation of the commodity markets. First, we discuss issues related to the identification of the price effects of financialization; then, we present models of commodity markets with heterogeneous agents and informational frictions and discuss the role of financial investors as the counterparts of commercial hedgers. Lastly, we suggest some avenues for future research, including the possible implications of the shale revolution and of commodity trading in the financialization process.",2018-01-01,
Never a Dull Moment: Entropy Risk in Commodity Markets,"We develop a new approach to determine investors' risk compensations for all distributional moments of a security. Using the concept of entropy, a summary of all moments of a risky security, we derive the relationship between expected returns and their compensation for entropy risk. Entropy risk premium (ERP), the difference of entropy under the physical and risk-neutral measures, indicates the cost to financially hedge against changes in risks associated with the entire return distribution. We find that ERP carries significant predictive power for the cross-section of commodity returns even after removing its variance, skewness and kurtosis risk components.",2018-01-01,

How financial investment distorts food prices: evidence from U.S. grain markets,"Abstract Convergence between commodity futures prices and the underlying physical assets at each contract's expiration date is a pivotal condition for the market's functioning. Between 2005 and 2010, convergence failed for several U.S. grain markets. This article presents a price pressure‐augmented commodity storage model that links the scale of nonconvergence to financial investment channeled through indices, which are traded in commodity futures markets. The model is empirically tested, using Markov regime‐switching regression analysis. Regression results strongly support the model's predicted link between index investment and the extent of nonconvergence for three grains traded at the Chicago Board of Trade: wheat, corn, and soybeans.",2017-12-18,
Time-Varying Window Length for Correlation Forecasts,"Forecasting correlations between stocks and commodities is important for diversification across asset classes and other risk management decisions. Correlation forecasts are affected by model uncertainty, the sources of which can include uncertainty about changing fundamentals and associated parameters (model instability), structural breaks and nonlinearities due, for example, to regime switching. We use approaches that weight historical data according to their predictive content. Specifically, we estimate two alternative models, ‘time-varying weights’ and ‘time-varying window’, in order to maximize the value of past data for forecasting. Our empirical analyses reveal that these approaches provide superior forecasts to several benchmark models for forecasting correlations.",2017-12-11,
Commodity Market Heterogeneity and Cross-Market Integration,"We evaluate the recent levels of heterogeneity and cross-market integration for fluctuations in commodity futures returns for a post-financial-crisis data sample. We find that a single commodity-market risk factor explains 30.6% of the total variation in commodity futures returns. The commodity-market risk factor is significantly correlated with the dominant market-wide risk factors from other asset classes: +66.7% with a market risk factor for the US equity market; -74.2% with a US dollar risk factor for the FX market; and -27.8% with an interest-rate level risk factor for the US interest rate market. Thus, a part of the systematic variation in the commodity market is integrated with other asset classes.",2017-12-06,
Is Beta Dead for Commodities?,"Analyzing the relationship between stocks and commodities is important for investors using commodities as a part of their asset allocation. The commodity beta measures how much the commodity return will fall/rise (in percent) if the overall stock market falls/rises 1%. This beta can be decomposed into two parts: the correlation between commodity returns and stock returns, and the relative volatility between commodity returns and stock returns. In this article, the authors show that the static long-term correlation and beta between commodities and stocks vary, but are generally low over time. Slightly more than half of the commodity betas and correlations have reverted back to or below the long-term level. For most commodities, the relative volatility to stocks is now at its long-term level. The authors find it hard to give support to the “financialization” of commodities, since the “spike” in correlation seems temporary, plus the fact that futures return distributions are different (and change differently) than stocks. Rather, they believe that the different characteristics (and the changes) are due to commodity-specific demand/supply conditions, storage properties, general risk aversion, and market regimes. <b>TOPICS:</b>Security analysis and valuation, commodities",2017-11-22,
"Monetary policy uncertainty, positions of traders and changes in commodity futures prices","Abstract This paper examines the sensitivity of commodity price changes to monetary policy uncertainty. We find evidence that the response of commodity price changes hinges on the sign of the monetary policy shock, the level of monetary policy uncertainty as well as a recession dummy. Uncertainty associated with negative monetary policy shocks leads to a decrease in commodity prices and excess speculative activity. The results from estimating an asset pricing model suggest that monetary policy uncertainty appears not to be a priced risk factor in the cross‐section of commodity price changes.",2017-11-15,
Understanding the Sources of Risk Underlying the Cross Section of Commodity Returns,"We show that a model featuring an average commodity factor, a carry factor, and a momentum factor is capable of describing the cross-sectional variation of commodity returns. More parsimonious one- and two-factor models that feature only the average and/or carry factors are rejected. To provide an economic interpretation, we show that innovations in global equity volatility can price portfolios formed on carry, while innovations in a commodity-based measure of speculative activity can price portfolios formed on momentum. Finally, we characterize the relation between the factors and the investment opportunity set.

Financial exposure and technology innovation investment,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify, measure and optimise financial risk and its effect on returns from innovation projects on an accrual basis and on a cash basis in a commodity industry. Design/methodology/approach A hypothetical case study, based on a real case, of a petrochemical commodity industry in Brazil was analysed with commodities pricing rules based on actual contracts. Earnings at risk (EaR) and cash flow at risk (CFaR) measures were applied, as well as a metric proposed in this paper called cash balance at risk (CBaR). Findings The paper demonstrates that financial risk measurement and optimisation are important issues in the decision-making process in the petrochemical industry. EaR, CFaR and CBaR measures are helpful when used alongside standard procedures of project evaluation. The findings also show that innovative technologies, in certain conditions, may act as “natural hedging”. It was found that the time delay between revenues and expenses leads to financial risk exposure to changes in prices and foreign exchange rates. Projects can use financing and hedging to boost their results. Originality/value An innovative project was compared with an expansion project in a petrochemical industry. A model for petrochemical commodities contract pricing was added in an analysis that included financing and hedging. The findings in this paper suggest that it is important to consider financial risk measures in project evaluation.",2017-10-26,
Dynamic connectedness and causality between oil prices and exchange rates,"We study connectedness and causality between oil prices and exchange rates dynamically. Using data on the WTI and exchange rate returns for six countries in which oil production is a major production activity, we show that oil prices are net receptors of spillovers from excahnge rate markets. Connectedness exhibits important time variation and presents a positive trend during our sample period. We find evidence of bidirectional causality between oil prices and exchange rates, which presents also considerable time-variation. Causality is identified for longer periods of time from oil prices to exchange rates. However, we also find evidence of reverse causality, mainly in the period after the Subprime Financial Crisis. Our results provide evidence supporting the hypothesis of the financialization of oil markets.",2017-10-10,
"Oil, gold, US dollar and stock market interdependencies: a global analytical insight","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine, in a global perspective, the oil, gold, US dollar and stock prices interdependencies and to identify instantaneously direct and indirect linkages among them. Design/methodology/approach A methodology based on simultaneous equations system was used to identify direct and indirect linkages for the period 1995-2015. The authors try initially to find theoretical answers to main question of the study by discussing causal bilateral relationships while focusing on multilateral interactions. Findings The results show significant interactions between all markets. The authors found a negative relation between oil and stock prices but oil price is significantly and positively affected by gold and USD. Oil price is also affected by oil futures prices and by Chinese oil gross imports. Gold rate is concerned by changes in oil, USD and stock markets. The US dollar is negatively affected by stock market and significantly by oil and gold price. Indirect effects always exist which confirm the presence of global interdependencies and involve the financialization process of commodity markets. Originality/value Motivation of this research paper is the substantial implications of price movements on real economy and financial markets. Understanding that co-movement has great value for investors, policy makers and portfolio managers. This paper differs from previous studies in several aspects. First, most of the research papers focus on bilateral linkages solely, while the authors’ investigation was implemented on all the four markets simultaneously. Second, the study was developed in a global framework using international data. The global analysis allows avoiding country specific effects.",2017-10-02,

Structural Volatility Impulse Response Function and Asymptotic Inference,This paper traces contemporaneous effects of independent shocks on predicted future volatilities through time. The shocks are identified through time-varying heteroscedasticity. I obtain the explicit functions of volatility impulse responses for a structural system of simultaneity.

The potential of this new framework is empirically illustrated in a structural system of the U.S. commodity and stock markets.,2017-09-15,
Financialization in Commodity Markets,"The ﬁnancialization view is that increased trading in commodity futures markets is associated with increases in the growth rate and volatility of commodity spot prices. This view gained credence be-cause in the 2000s trading volume increased sharply and many commodity prices rose and became more volatile. Using a large panel dataset we constructed, which includes commodities with and with-out futures markets, we ﬁnd no empirical link between increased futures market trading and changes in price behavior. Our data sheds light on the economic role of futures markets. The conventional view is that futures markets provide one-way insurance by allowing outsiders, traders with no direct interest in a commodity, to insure insiders, traders with a direct interest. The data are not consistent with the conventional view and we argue that they point to an alternative mutual insurance view, in which all participants insure each other. We formalize this view in a model and show that it is consistent with key features of the data.",2017-08-24,
Futures Trading and the Excess Co-movement of Commodity Prices*,"We empirically reinvestigate the issue of the excess co-movement of commodity prices initially raised in Pindyck and Rotemberg (1990). Excess co-movement appears when commodity prices remain correlated even after adjusting for the impact of fundamentals. We use recent developments in large approximate factor models to consider a richer information set and adequately model these fundamentals. We consider a set of eight unrelated commodities along with 184 real and nominal macroeconomic variables, from developed and emerging economies, from which nine factors are extracted over the 1993–2013 period. Our estimates provide evidence of time-varying excess co-movement which is particularly high after 2007. We further show that speculative intensity is a driver of the estimated excess co-movement, as speculative trading is both correlated across the commodity futures markets and correlated with the futures prices. Our results can be taken as direct evidence of the significant impact of financialization on commodity-price cross-moments.",2017-08-23,
Commodity Price Comovement and Financial Speculation: The Case of Cotton,"Recent booms and busts in commodity prices have generated concerns that financial speculation causes excessive commodity‐price comovement, driving prices away from levels implied by supply and demand under rational expectations. We develop a structural vector autoregression model of a commodity futures market and use it to explain two recent spikes in cotton prices. In doing so, we make two contributions to the literature on commodity price dynamics. First, we estimate the extent to which cotton price booms and busts can be attributed to comovement with other commodities. Finding such comovement would be necessary but would not be sufficient evidence to establish that broad‐based financial speculation drives commodity prices. Second, after controlling for aggregate demand and comovement, we develop a new method to point identify shocks to precautionary demand for cotton separately from shocks to current supply and demand. To do so, we use differences in volatility across time implied by the rational expectations competitive storage model. We find limited evidence that financial speculation caused cotton prices to spike in 2008 or 2011. We conclude that the 2008 price spike was driven mostly by precautionary demand for cotton, and the 2011 spike was caused by a net supply shortfall.",2017-08-09,
Did the Renewable Fuel Standard Shift Market Expectations of the Price of Ethanol?,"It is commonly believed that the response of the price of corn ethanol (and hence of the price of corn) to shifts in biofuel policies operates in part through market expectations and shifts in storage demand, yet to date it has proved difficult to measure these expectations and to empirically evaluate this view.We quantify the extent to which price changes were anticipated by the market, the extent to which they were unanticipated, and how the risk premium in these markets has evolved.We show that the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) increased ethanol price expectations by as much $1.50 initially, raising ethanol storage demand starting and causing an increase in the price of ethanol.There is no conclusive evidence that the tightening of the RFS in 2008 shifted market expectations, but our analysis suggests that policy uncertainty about how to deal with the blend wall raised the risk premium in the ethanol futures market in mid-2013 by as much as 50 cents at longer horizons.Finally, we present evidence against a tight link from ethanol price expectations to corn price expectations and hence to the storage demand for corn in 2005-06.",2017-08-01,
Commodity price bubbles and macroeconomics: evidence from the Chinese agricultural markets,"Abstract This article investigates the links between commodity price bubbles and macroeconomic factors, with an application to the agricultural commodity markets in China from 2006 to 2014. Price bubbles are identified using a newly developed, recursive right‐tailed unit root test. A Zero‐inflated Poisson model is used to analyze the factors contributing to bubbles. Results show that (a) there were speculative bubbles in most Chinese agricultural commodity futures markets during the sample period, though their presence was infrequent; (b) economic growth, money supply, and inflation have positive effects on bubble occurrences, while interest rates have a negative effect; and (c) among all macroeconomic factors considered, economic growth and money supply have the greatest impact in triggering bubbles. Our findings shed new light on the nature and formation of bubbles in the Chinese agricultural commodity markets.",2017-07-19,
Financial activity in agricultural futures markets: evidence from quantile regressions,"This study analyses the relationship between financial activity and price returns in 12 US agricultural futures markets. It contributes to the existing research by exploring the forecasting power of trading activity for returns from the perspective of conditional quantiles.

Oil and stock markets before and after financial crises: A local Gaussian correlation approach,"The effect of financial shocks on the cross‐market linkages between oil prices (spot and futures) and stock markets is examined for four major crises. We employ the local Gaussian correlation approach and find that the two markets were regionalized for most of the 1990s and the early 2000s. Flights from stocks to oil occur in all crisis episodes, except the recent global financial crisis. The view that stock and oil markets behave like “a market of one” after the financialization of commodities is further supported by the presence of contagion between US stock markets and all the benchmark oil markets.",2017-07-14,
An Equilibrium Model for Spot and Forward Prices of Commodities,"We consider a market model that consists of financial investors and producers of a commodity. Producers optionally store some production for future sale and go short on forward contracts to hedge the uncertainty of the future commodity price. Financial investors take positions in these contracts to diversify their portfolios. The spot and forward equilibrium commodity prices are endogenously derived as the outcome of the interaction between producers and investors. Assuming that both are utility maximizers, we first prove the existence of an equilibrium in an abstract setting. Then, in a framework where the consumers’ demand and the exogenously priced financial market are correlated, we provide semi-explicit expressions for the equilibrium prices and analyze their dependence on the model parameters. The model can explain why increased investors’ participation in forward commodity markets and higher correlation between the commodity and the stock market could result in higher spot prices and lower forward premia.",2017-07-10,
Estimating the Location of World Wheat Price Discovery,"Abstract The United States may be losing its leadership role in the world wheat market. Rising trading volume in foreign futures markets and shifting shares of world trade are suggested as evidence of this shift, but neither necessitates that futures markets in the United States are any less important for wheat price discovery. This paper applies high frequency pricing data and market microstructure methods, including the Yan and Zivot (2010) information leadership share, to estimate the proportion of price discovery occurring in wheat futures markets associated with Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and Paris. We find United States futures markets remain dominant, although the share of price discovery for the Paris market increased noticeably in 2010, coinciding with major supply shocks in Russia and Ukraine. Prior to August 2010, 91% of information about the common fundamental value of wheat was first revealed in United States futures markets in an average month. After August 2010, this share dropped to 75%.",2017-07-08,
Commodities returns’ volatility in financialization era,"Purpose This paper aims to indirectly evaluate the accuracy of various volatility models using a value-at-risk (VaR) approach and to investigate the relationship between the accuracy of volatility modelling and investments performance in the financialized commodity markets. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the VaR back-testing approach at six different commodities, seven different volatility models and five different time horizons. Findings This paper finds that the moving average (MA) VaR model tends to be the best for oil, copper, wheat and corn (long horizon) whereas the exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (E-GARCH) VaR model tends to be the best for gold, silver and corn (short horizon). Our findings indicate that MA volatility model should be used for oil, copper, wheat and corn (for longer time horizons) commodities whereas E-GARCH volatility model should be used for gold, silver and corn (for short time horizons) commodities. We also find that there is a positive relationship between an accurate VaR performance and commodity return. This indicates that a good job in modelling volatility will be rewarded by higher returns in financialized commodity markets. Originality/value This paper indirectly evaluates the accuracy of volatility model via VaR measure and investigates the relationship between the accuracy of volatility and investments performance in financialized commodity markets. This paper contributes to the literature by offering VaR approach in evaluating volatility model performance and reporting the importance of performing accurate volatility modelling in financialized commodity markets.",2017-07-03,
Financialization of Commodities and the Monetary Transmission Mechanism,"Institutional change and deregulation laid the groundwork for financialization of the U.S. commodity futures markets. Financial innovations allowed investors, through Wall Street banks, to circumvent position limit regulations so that financial traders now dominate futures markets and the price discovery process. As an asset class, prices of commodities now behave like the price of any asset: They are more volatile and subject to periodic bubbles. Financialization of commodity markets suggests the possibility of a more direct transmission mechanism from monetary policy to measured inflation. The Federal Reserve's policy of Quantitative Easing announced in November 2010 provides an operative example of this mechanism.",2017-07-03,

"Volatility Spillover between Water, Energy and Food","Water, energy, and food and are strongly interconnected, and the sustainability of the whole world depends on this link. The aim of this article is to analyze the volatility spillovers between indexes representing the financial component of this nexus. We use a multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model with daily data in which the water variable is proxy by equity index that represents the performance of the industry involved in water business both at the global and local levels. For the food and energy sectors, we use two sub-indexes of the S&amp;P Goldman Sachs (GS)-Commodity Index. Our results highlight the existence of a financial nexus between water, energy, and food that was particularly exacerbated during 2008 crisis. Evidence therefore suggests the need to better investigate the policy options that can be used to reduce price volatility in a framework of the rising relevance of sustainability issues.",2017-06-20,

Results show that rising attention, on one hand, increases information efficiency and attenuates arbitrage opportunities, whereas, on the other hand, decreases market efficiency by facilitating herd behavior.",2017-05-05,
The impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on international commodity prices,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on a large sample of 19 commodity markets. Design/methodology/approach The authors rely on Jurado et al. ’s (2015) measure of macroeconomic uncertainty based on a wide range of monthly macroeconomic and financial indicators and estimate a threshold VAR model to assess whether the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on commodity prices differs under the high- or low-uncertainty state. Findings The findings show that positive macroeconomic uncertainty shocks affect commodity prices returns negatively on average and the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty is generally higher in high-uncertainty states compared with low-uncertainty states. Besides, although the safe-haven role of precious metals is confirmed, energy and industrial markets are more sensitive to short-run and long-run macroeconomic uncertainty, respectively. Research limitations/implications The findings in this study suggest that commodity prices reflect not only the level of economic fundamental but also the volatility of economic fundamental. Originality/value This study empirically analyzes and verifies the influence of macroeconomic uncertainty not only on oil prices but also on four groups of 19 raw materials. As for the methodological issues, the authors rely on a structural threshold vector autoregressive specification for modeling commodity price returns to account for potentially different effects depending on the macroeconomic uncertainty states.",2017-04-05,
Spicing Up a Portfolio with Commodity Futures: <i>Still a Good Recipe?</i>,"In this article, the authors investigate whether employing individual commodity futures provides a superior optimized risk–return strategy relative to an equity portfolio, given the recent rise in correlations between commodity and equity markets. They first construct Markowitz mean–variance optimized portfolios of commodity and financial futures contracts within sample and then evaluate their subsequent out-of-sample performance using various time periods, targeted risk levels, and rebalancing frequencies. These portfolios generally outperform benchmark equity indexes, both in terms of return and risk levels. The portfolios also exhibit lower tail risk (reduced potential extreme losses) relative to the equity indexes. These findings support the use of commodity futures for both diversification and portfolio optimization purposes and illustrate appropriate application metrics.

Fundamental and Financial Influences on the Co-movement of Oil and Gas Prices,"As speculative flows into commodity futures are expected to link commodity prices more strongly to equity indices, we investigate whether this process also creates increased correlations amongst the commodities themselves. Considering U.S. oil and gas futures, we investigate whether common factors, derived from a large international data set of real and nominal macroeconomic variables by means of the large approximate factor models methodology, are able to explain both returns and whether, beyond these fundamental common factors, the residuals remain correlated. We further investigate a possible explanation for this residual correlation by using some proxies for trading intensity derived from CFTC publicly available data, showing most notably that the proxy for speculation in the oil market increases the oil-gas correlation. We thus identify the central role of financial activities in shaping the link between oil and gas returns.",2017-03-01,
Alternative Asset Classes,"Reports that a variety of Islamic alternative assets exist, which comprise all financial investments apart from listed equity and fixed income securities, including (1) private equity; (2) hedge funds; (3) real estate investment trusts (REITs); (4) the hal?l food industry; (5) trade financing instruments; and (6) infrastructure investments through project finance—all of which serve different purposes and share few common characteristics apart from usually proving less liquid than mainstream investments and relatively new—from an Islamic finance perspective—coming into play only since the 2007–08 global financial crisis. The variety of alternative asset classes means shari'ah concerns vary, with some assets, such as private equity holdings, remaining inherently more shari'ah-compliant than others, such as hedge funds. Pricing of alternative assets often proves uncorrelated with equity prices and those of fixed income instruments, including suk?k (Islamic certificates of investment).

The monetary root of financialisation,"Marxism has a strong influence on Western left-wing economists’ understanding of financialisation, in that they regard financialisation as the consequence of the transformation of capitalism. Neoclassical economics and finance scholars tend to think of financialisation (financial development) as not exclusively occurring within the economic system of capitalism but as existing throughout an entire human history filled with numerous financial innovations. The unprecedented change of the monetary system ascribed to the collapse of the Bretton Woods System, among all historical and systemic changes, is the strongest underlying impetus to financialisation. Financialisation is the unintended consequence of a change in the monetary system from commodity money to credit money. Taking a more in-depth point of view, financialisation is philosophically a means for human beings to cope with the advent of a risk society, reflecting the advance of instrumental rationality, and hence is the embodiment of late modernity.",2017-01-02,

There are two types of fluctuation patterns in the underlying prices: the pattern of persistent and modest rises and the pattern of abrupt rises followed by dramatic falls. The analysis reveals that these two fluctuation patterns are related to a growing phenomenon of goods financialisation in China. This paper uses time series data to show that goods financialisation in China is indeed under its way to various levels, which renders different dynamic effects on consumer price inflation. The findings also have implications for making macroeconomic policies.",2017-01-02,
Common Factors of Commodity Prices,"In this paper we extract latent factors from a large cross-section of commodity prices, including fuel and non-fuel commodities. We decompose each commodity price series into a global (or common) component, block-specific components and a purely idiosyncratic shock. We find that the bulk of the fluctuations in commodity prices is well summarised by a single global factor. This global factor is closely related to fluctuations in global economic activity and its importance in explaining commodity price variations has increased since the 2000s, especially for oil prices.",2017-01-01,
Has Crude Oil Become a Financial Asset? Evidence from Ten Years of Financialization,"The financialization of commodity markets over the last decade has changed the behavior of commodity prices in fundamental ways. In this paper, we uncover the gradual transformation of commodities from a physical to a financial asset. Although economic demand and supply factors continue to play an important role, recent indicators associated with financialization have emerged since 2008. We show that financial variables have become the main driving factors explaining the variation in commodity returns and volatility today. Our findings have important implications for portfolio analysis and for the effectiveness of hedging in commodity markets.",2017-01-01,
"The Third Dimension of Financialization: Electronification, Intraday Institutional Trading, and Commodity Market Quality","We provide the first detailed empirical evidence on the financialization of intraday trading activity in the world's largest commodity market and show that this development had a first-order positive impact on market liquidity and pricing efficiency. We use a rich regulatory dataset to show that the electronification of U.S. crude oil futures trading in 2006 brought about a massive growth in intraday activity by ""non-commercial"" institutional financial traders. We exploit differences in the post-electronification growth rates of institutional financial trading in crude oil futures contracts of different maturities to tease out the effect of financialization on key metrics of commodity market quality. We show that increased institutional financial trading reduces the variance of pricing errors, narrows bid-ask spreads, and improves market depth. Our inferences are robust to differences in the nature and volume of non-financial trading. Finally, we provide novel evidence of notable differences between the respective contributions of high-frequency traders (HFTs) vs. other (non-HFT) institutional financial traders to different market quality attributes.",2017-01-01,
Increasing Trends in the Excess Comovement of Commodity Prices,"We investigate how the excess comovement of commodity prices, that is, the correlation in commodity returns after filtering out common fundamental shocks, has changed over the past three decades by developing the smooth-transition dynamic conditional correlation model that can capture long-run trends and short-run dynamics of correlation simultaneously. Using data from 1983 to 2011, we find that significant increasing long-run trends in excess comovement have appeared since around 2000. We confirm that these increasing trends are neither an artefact of the financial crisis after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 nor the time-varying sensitivities of commodity returns to common fundamental shocks. Moreover, we find that no significant increasing trends exist in the excess comovement among off-index commodities and that the surge of global demand alone cannot explain the increasing trends. These findings provide additional evidence for the timing and scope of the recent increasing commodity-return correlations that suggest the influence of the financialization of commodity markets starting around 2000.",2017-01-01,
Commodity Option Implied Volatilities and the Expected Futures Returns,"The detrended implied volatility of commodity options (VOL) forecasts the cross section of the commodity futures returns significantly. A zero-cost strategy that is long in low VOL and short in high VOL commodities yields an annualized return of 12.66% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.69. Notably, the excess returns based on the volatility strategy emanate mainly from its forecasting power for the future spot component, different from the other commodity strategies examined so far in the literature which are all driven by roll returns. This strategy demonstrates low correlations (below 10%) with the other strategies such as momentum or basis and performs especially well in recessions. Our results are robust after controlling for illiquidity, other commodity pricing factors, and exposure to the aggregate commodity market volatility. The VOL measure is associated with hedging pressure on the futures and especially on the options market. News media also helps amplify the uncertainty impact. Variables related to investors’ lottery preferences and market frictions are able to explain part of the predictive relationship.",2017-01-01,
Carry Trades and Tail Risk: Evidence from Commodity Markets,"I investigate the relationship between carry trades and tail risk for a panel of commodity futures contracts. Unlike other asset classes, carry in commodities is highly volatile both in the time series and in the cross section. By using a panel quantile regression with commodity fixed effect, I document the tail-specific effect of carry on the conditional distribution of futures returns both in the short-term and in longer-term. The main empirical results show that carry has a significant effect on tail risk mostly in the short term and for the front end of the futures curve. In addition, the empirical evidence shows that such relationship can be explained by the role of non-natural hedgers, such as non-commercial traders, money managers and index traders, which tend to unwind their net-long futures positions when exposed to deteriorating aggregate financial conditions and increasing market uncertainty. This is consistent with existing theoretical models in which speculators and insurance providers are subject to limited risk capacity and financing liquidity constraints.",2017-01-01,
Jumps in Commodity Markets,"This paper investigates price jumps in commodity markets. We find that jumps are rare and extreme events but occur less frequently than in stock markets. Nonetheless, jump correlations across commodities can be high depending on the commodity sectors. Energy, metal and grains commodities show high jump correlations while jumps of meats and softs commodities are barely correlated. Looking at crossmarket correlations, we find that returns of commodities co-move with the stock market, while jumps can be diversified. Most commodities are strong hedges for U.S. Dollar returns but weak hedges for U.S. Dollar jumps. Most commodities act as both return and jump hedges for Treasury notes.",2017-01-01,
Es El Mercado De Metales Eficiente? (Is the Metals Market Efficient?),"Spanish Abstract: La predicción de los precios de las materias primas es importante por su impacto a nivel macroeconómico en las naciones que dependen de su comercio internacional, así mismo tiene importancia financiera para quienes negocian sus futuros en bolsa. Este trabajo propone evaluar la hipótesis de eficiencia en el sentido débil en el mercado de metales, la cual argumenta que un mercado eficiente no es susceptible de predicción de precios. Para este propósito se implementaron métodos de caminata aleatoria. Se encontraron materias primas persistentemente ineficientes durante el periodo de evaluación de 1992 a 2015, así como que algunas materias primas fluctúan entre periodos de eficiencia y no eficiencia.",2017-01-01,
Hedging Effectiveness of Commodities in the Stock Portfolio: Empirical Evidence from Pakistan Stock Exchange using Multivariate GARCH Models,"This study explores the hedging effectiveness of oil and gold assets in Pakistani stock market.We incorporate three multivariate GARCH models for hedging potential of oil and gold assets in stock market of Pakistan.The DCC model is found fitted among others for empirical analysis.The empirical results indicate that the asymmetric effect is positive (negative) providing that negative shocks tend to increase (decrease) volatility in future more than positive shocks of the same magnitude for stock market and oil (gold).During the Global Financial Crisis 2007-2009, the study finds a positive trend in correlations between oil-stock pair suggesting a lack of portfolio diversification benefit of oil when added in stock portfolio.However, a more prominent negative trend in correlations between gold-stock pair shows that gold proves a potential safe haven asset for stocks in Pakistan.The results also reveal that investors must adjust their hedging position in oil and gold assets for their portfolio of stocks across the study period, as the optimal hedge ratios for stock-oil/gold pairs are dynamic in nature.Overall, the average negative values of hedging effectiveness indicate that unhedged portfolio performs better than the hedged ones.These results contain implications for different stakeholders including policymakers, portfolio managers, domestic and international investors.",2017-01-01,
Are Commodity Futures Prices Barometers of the Global Economy?,"This paper analyzes whether commodity futures prices traded in the United States reveal information relevant to stock prices of East Asian economies including China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan.We find significant and positive predictive powers of overnight futures returns of copper and soybeans, albeit not crude oil, for stock prices of all these East Asian economies and across a broad range of industries after mid-2000s.Our analysis establishes commodity futures prices as barometers of global economic strength in recent years, but leaves open a deeper issue regarding whether through this informational channel noise from futures market trading can feed back to the real economy.",2017-01-01,
The Zero Lower Bound and Market Spillovers: Evidence from the G7 and Norway,"This paper investigates mean and volatility spillovers between the crude oil market and three financial markets, namely the debt, stock, and foreign exchange markets, while providing international evidence from each of the seven major advanced economies (G7), and the small open oil-exporting economy of Norway. Using monthly data for the period from May 1987 to March 2016, and a four-variable VARMA-GARCH model with a BEKK variance specification, we find significant spillovers and interactions among the markets, but also absence of a hierarchy of influence from one specific market to the others. We further incorporate a structural break to examine the possible effects of the prolonged episode of zero lower bound in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and provide evidence of strengthened linkages from all the eight international economies.",2017-01-01,
"Dynamic Spillover Effects across Petroleum Spot and Futures Volatilities, Trading Volume and Open Interest","This paper examines the existence of dynamic spillover effects across petroleum based commodities and among spot-futures volatilities, trading volume and open interest. Realized volatilities of spot-futures markets are used as inputs to estimate a VAR model following (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2015, 2012, 2009; Diebold and YÄ±lmaz, 2014) and distinguish dynamic spillovers in total and net effects. Results reveal the existence of large and time-varying spillovers among the spot-futures volatilities and across petroleum-based commodities when examined pairwise. In addition, speculative pressures, as reflected by futures trading volume, and hedging pressures, as reflected by open interest, are shown to transmit large and persistent spillovers to the spot and futures volatilities of crude oil and heating oil-gasoline markets, respectively.",2017-01-01,
The Financialization of the Term Structure of Risk Premia in Commodity Markets,"In this paper, I examine how financialization affects the term structure of risk premia by using an equilibrium model for commodity futures markets. I define financialization as the entry of cross-asset investors, who are exposed to a commodity risk, into a commodity market. Qualitatively, the model shows that the financialization decreases the segmentation between commodity markets and the stock market. It also shows that speculators and investors both provide and consume liquidity and that the investment pressure from investors creates new risk premia. Further the model shows that financialization affects the entire term structure of risk premia. Quantitatively, these effects depend on the physical characteristics of the commodity market under study.",2017-01-01,
Revealing financial interactions,"This research focuses on understanding the mechanism of financial phenomena in asset markets, such as recent price bubbles in global commodity markets, and the contagion of financial crisis in the Eurozone. Hang Sun develops novel methodologies to analyze how the interactions among investors and different markets affect commodity and stock prices. With these analyses, he finds the recent price volatilities in commodity markets can be partly attributed to the co-existence of different investor groups that employ sub-rational trading strategies. He also reveals how the network of mutual influences among different European stock markets changes during the Eurozone crises.",2017-01-01,
Is Financialization Effect Detectable within International Oil Markets?,"Over the past two decades increasing transformations involving the commodities pricing mechanisms jointly with relevant innovations introduced in financial markets spurred controversial issues both among policy-makers, practitioners and scholars about resulting overall effects on the economy. Common explanations advocated by experts are focused on two main features: increasing hypertrophic financialization of commodity markets and structural economic factors linked to traditional supply-demand imbalances. Oil markets have been an early example of this trend. In the present paper, with the aim to contribute to the discussion, a cross-correlation function (ccf) is applied to financial variables (Stock Exchange Indexes and main international quoted oil prices) to investigate the dynamic relationship depicting the potential existing mechanism. In order to propose a relevant analysis, data pertaining some industrialized Countries (Germany, United Kingdom and United States) as well as some important developing Countries (Brazil, China and India) are processed.",2017-01-01,
Predictability of Financialization and Co-Movement in Commodity Market: What Is the Role of Technical Indicators,"This paper investigates the financialization and structural co-movement of several commodity futures using factor variance decomposition and predictability of technical indicators and macro variables. We find that financialization is still a dominant player in the commodity market and that recent commodity price fluctuations can be significantly and robustly forecasted by technical analyses of commodity index investments. Moreover, the co-movement of commodities is demonstrated by variance decomposition and explained as commodity index investment, which provides evidence of financialization. The overall empirical analysis reveals that technical indicators and macro variables can statistically and economically forecast the indexed investment and off-index trading, respectively, which indicates that they are suitable predictors of the commodity markets.",2017-01-01,
Commodity Market Contagion Under Uncertainty: Evidence from the Perspective of Financialization Versus Hedging Strategy,"This study explores the economic and financial effects of uncertainty on the commodity market integration. This issue is important from the perspective of financialization versus hedging strategy, as the commodity market plays an important role in this context. We consider the eight major developed equity markets and three major sectors of the commodity futures markets including energy, metals and agriculture, and several sources of uncertainty. To this end, we use the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) to capture the heterogeneity in the regression coefficients that vary across individuals and over time. Our main findings indicate a significant effect of uncertainty on the commodity markets in the two “extreme regimes” of the financial market (recessions and booms), and the sign of this effect is heterogeneous depending on the type of commodity and the source of uncertainty.",2017-01-01,
"Precious metals, oil and the exchange rate: contemporaneous spillovers","We investigate the contemporaneous spillovers among precious metals, crude oil and the US$ exchange rate. We contend that conventional reduced-form vector autoregressive (VAR) models based on lead/lag relations do not fully capture the interactions among these series as these models ignore the contemporaneous effects. Using a Structural VAR model, we identify these contemporaneous spillovers, which are shown to be strong and asymmetric. We further show that not taking into consideration the contemporaneous interactions among these assets leads to inaccurate findings and inevitably to inaccurate interpretations of the causal relations among them.",2016-12-20,
Financialization and Commodity Market Stability,"Abstract Stability in supply of commodities is essential for manufacturing and doing business. This fact is unchangeable despite the passage of time and only the ways of trading of commodities differ. Especially in recent decades, the global economy has changed significantly and one of the major factors fueling its transformation is financialization. This phenomenon, gaining importance with the beginning of the 21st century, affects all areas of the economy. Commodity markets are not free of it either. This leads to various structural changes in terms of ways of trading, price formation and volatility in commodity markets. The aim of this article is to investigate the roots of financialization of commodity markets, and to assess its influence on their stabilitythrough investigation of time series data from 1991 to 2015 and examining correlation coefficients. The results of the study conducted for the purposes of this article depict not only the volatility of commodity markets, but also a positive correlation between prices of major commodities over the examined period and a positive correlation between prices of major commodities and equity markets from 2009 up to 2012, thus the period of recovery after the subprime mortgage crisis.",2016-12-01,
Portfolio-based contract selection in commodity futures markets,"As financial future markets offer coexistent contracts that only differ in their maturities, trading mandatorily induces the task of selecting a specific contract. Assuming the objective of maximal profit, an analysis of the current market situation is inevitable. Among immediate and upcoming trading costs and market liquidity, even possible market inefficiencies might be taken into consideration. This research introduces a future selection strategy that minimizes trading costs by dynamic programming. The strategy is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations on sets of arbitrary trading instructions on three commodity classes. The results allow the conclusion of market inefficiencies in the analyzed future markets.",2016-12-01,
INTEREST RATES AND THE VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION OF COMMODITY PRICES,"We propose a novel explanation for the observed increase in the correlation of commodity prices over the past decade. In contrast to theories that rely on the increased influence of financial speculators, we examine the effect of interest rates on the volatility and correlation of commodity prices via a panel GARCH model. In theory, lower interest rates decrease the volatility of prices, as lower inventory costs promote the smoothing of transient shocks, and increase price correlation if common shocks are more persistent than idiosyncratic shocks. Empirically, we find that price volatility attributable to transitory shocks declines with interest rates, whereas particularly for metals prices, price correlation increases as interest rates decline.",2016-11-09,
Monetary policy shocks and the dynamics of agricultural commodity prices: evidence from structural and factor‐augmented VAR analyses,"Abstract Fluctuation in commodity prices is a significant and timely issue to be studied. This study is to examine the impact of monetary policy and other macroeconomic shocks on the dynamics of agricultural commodity prices. The major contributions of this study are twofold. First, unlike other studies that use indexes, this study analyzes the commodities individually, affording the inclusion of commodity‐specific fundamentals such as the level of inventory—an important determinant of commodity price—in a structural VAR framework. Second, it exploits a rich data set of agricultural commodity prices which includes commodities that are usually overlooked in the literature, and extracts a common factor using the dynamic factor model to understand the extent of comovement of the prices and to gauge the extent to which macroeconomic shocks drive the “comovement” in a factor‐augmented VAR (FAVAR) framework. The findings show that monetary policy, global economic conditions, and the U.S. dollar exchange rates play an important role in the dynamics of agricultural commodity prices.",2016-11-08,

El fin de la naturaleza barata: o cómo aprendí a dejar de preocuparme por “el” medioambiente y amar la crisis del capitalismo,"¿Afronta actualmente el capitalismo el “fin de la naturaleza barata”? Si así es, ¿qué podría significar esto y cuáles con las implicaciones para el futuro? Estamos, de hecho, siendo testigos del fin de la naturaleza barata en un sentido específico histórico. En vez de contemplar el fin de la naturaleza barata como la reafirmación de “límites de crecimiento” externos, sostengo que, a día de hoy, el capitalismo ha agotado la relación histórica que la produce. El fin de la naturaleza barata se comprende mejor como el agotamiento de las relaciones de valor que han restaurado periódicamente los “Four Cheaps”: trabajo, alimentos, energía y materias primas. Fundamentalmente, estas relaciones de valor son coproducidas por, y a través de, humanos con el resto de la naturaleza. La cuestión decisiva, por lo tanto, enciende las relaciones que envuelven y despliegan las sucesivas configuraciones de la naturaleza humana y extra-humana, simbólicamente capacitadas y materialmente realizadas, a través de la larga duración del sistema-mundo moderno. Significativamente, la apropiación de trabajo no remunerado —incluyendo los “regalos gratuitos” de la naturaleza— y la explotación del trabajo asalariado, forman una unidad dialéctica. Los límites del crecimiento enfrentados actualmente por el capital son suficientemente reales, y son “límites” coproducidos a través del capitalismo como ecología-mundo, uniendo la acumulación de capital, la búsqueda de poder y la coproducción de naturaleza como un todo orgánico. El límite de la ecología-mundo del capital es el capital en sí mismo.",2016-10-31,
Renewable versus nonrenewable resources: an analysis of volatility in futures prices,"This study outlines a new approach for differentiating commodity futures based on their exhaustibility. Various aspects of volatility in the futures prices of renewable resources (palm oil, coffee, soya beans, rice, wheat and corn) and nonrenewable resources (zinc, aluminium, natural gas, gold, crude oil and copper) are studied, exploring whether volatility is greater in the former than in the latter. We use a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to test our main hypothesis that the volatility in futures prices for renewable resources has recently been equal to or greater than the volatility in futures prices for nonrenewable resources. Our key findings suggest that futures prices for some renewable resources have greater variance than those for benchmark crude oil in a simulated GARCH series. We extend our analysis using a nonlinear vector smooth transition autoregressive (VSTAR) model to test for the existence of a shifting-mean tendency in the commodity series that we researched. We show that transition from a stable to a volatile regime is more abrupt for renewable resources.",2016-10-21,
"Speculation in Commodity Futures Markets, Inventories and the Price of Crude Oil","This paper examines the role of inventories in refiners’ gasoline production and develops a structural model of the relationship between crude oil prices and inventories. Using data on inventories and prices of oil futures, I show that convenience yields decrease at a diminishing rate as inventories increase, consistent with the theory of storage. In addition to exhibiting seasonal and procyclical behaviors, I show that the historical convenience yield averages about 18 percent of the oil price from March 1989 to November 2014. Although some have argued that a breakdown of the relationship between crude oil inventories and prices following increased financial investors’ participation after 2004 was evidence of a speculative effect, I find that the proposed price-inventory relationship is stable over time. The empirical evidence indicates that crude oil prices remained tied to oil-market fundamentals such as inventories, suggesting that the contribution of financial investors’ activities was weak.",2016-10-17,
"Speculators, Prices, and Market Volatility","We use data from 2005–2009 that uniquely identify categories of traders to test how speculators such as hedge funds and swap dealers relate to volatility and price changes. In examining various subperiods where price trends are strong, we find little evidence that speculators destabilize financial markets. To the contrary, hedge fund position changes are negatively related to volatility in corn, crude oil, and natural gas futures markets. Additionally, swap dealer activity is largely unrelated to contemporaneous volatility. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that hedge funds provide valuable liquidity and largely serve to stabilize futures markets.",2016-10-01,
Zmiany na rynkach towarowych a regulacje nadzorcze w Unii Europejskiej,"W ciągu ostatnich dziesięcioleci rynki towarowe, mające duży wpływ na kształt gospodarki światowej, wielokrotnie się zmieniały pod względem strukturalnym.

Wraz z innymi czynnikami doprowadziło to do nadużyć na rynku, mniejszej przejrzystości handlu oraz nadmiernej spekulacji. Problemy te uwidoczniły się zwłaszcza w trakcie ostatniego kryzysu w latach 2007–2008 oraz bezpośrednio po nim.

The Financialization of Food?,"Commodity‐equity return co‐movements rose dramatically during the Great Recession. This development took place following what has been dubbed the “financialization” of commodity markets. We first document changes since 1995 in the relative importance of financial institutions’ activity in agricultural futures markets. We then use a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model to ascertain the role of that activity in explaining correlations between weekly grain, livestock, and equity returns from 1995–2015. We provide robust evidence that, accounting for shocks that are idiosyncratic to agricultural markets, world business cycle shocks have a substantial and long‐lasting impact on the latter's co‐movements with financial markets. In contrast, changes in the intensity of financial speculation have an impact on cross‐market return linkages that is shorter‐lived and not statistically significant in all model specifications.",2016-09-25,
Is news related to GDP growth a risk factor for commodity futures returns?,"Expectations about future economic activity should theoretically affect the demand for inventory holdings and therefore commodity spot and futures prices. Consistent with these predictions, we find that news related to future GDP growth is a significant factor that is priced in the cross section of commodity futures sorted by percentage net basis. The latter is highly correlated with inventories. In particular, it establishes that commodity futures with high inventory levels provide a hedge against risk associated with future GDP growth so that investors are willing to accept lower return. By contrast, those commodity futures with low inventory levels are inversely related to the GDP-related factor so that investors require a higher return. Such results suggest that commodity futures excess returns are a compensation for risk.",2016-09-14,
"Bubbles, Froth and Facts: Another Look at the Masters Hypothesis in Commodity Futures Markets","Abstract The Masters Hypothesis suggests that long‐only index funds were the main cause of a massive increase in commodity prices in 2007–2008 and 2011–2012. Central to the Masters Hypothesis are three basic tenets: (i) long‐only commodity index funds were directly responsible for driving futures prices higher; (ii) the deviations from fundamental value were economically very large; (iii) the impact was pervasive across commodity futures markets. There has been a great deal of empirical research on the Masters Hypothesis and commodity market bubbles. However, surprisingly few studies have found evidence that directly support the main tenets of the Masters Hypothesis. Some have attributed the lack of supporting evidence to the low‐power of time‐series tests, market efficiency issues and a lack of conditioning variables within models. In this paper, we address each of these issues using updated data and new empirical approaches. Still, price behaviour consistent with the Masters Hypothesis is surprisingly difficult to find in the data. This is an important finding given the on‐going policy debate and regulations proposed or being implemented to limit speculative positions in these markets.",2016-09-09,
From Futures Markets to the Farm Gate: A Study of Price Formation along Tanzania’s Coffee Commodity Chain,"This article examines the nature of price formation and transmission in the Tanzanian coffee price chain. To date, research on the real-world processes of price formation has been scant in economic geography and extant literatures. This article addresses this by focusing on price formation in geographically distant but connected markets, and the interaction between global and local price dynamics. The article employs a new framework that builds on chain and network approaches by integrating concepts from marketization and institutional approaches. The study finds that the world price of coffee has become increasingly volatile as a result of the behavior of international coffee traders and broader shifts in the character of global capital accumulation. It also demonstrates the varying role domestic marketing and local-level institutions play in shaping price formation and cushioning Tanzanian producers from sudden price changes. Finally, the study highlights the role prices, via these local-level institutions, play in extenuating differentiation between producers, creating winners and losers.",2016-09-05,
What Drives Long-term Oil Market Volatility? Fundamentals versus Speculation,"Abstract This paper explores the role of speculation and economy fundamentals in the oil market using a two-component GARCH-MIDAS model. Specifically, the authors highlight the different roles played by the changing oil shocks with respect to the short-term and long-term components regarding oil market volatility. The results indicate that a global demand shock is the only factor found not only to be positive but to also significantly increase long- and short-term oil volatility in the full sample. This is consistent with a classic host of research that advocates that global demand dominates the oil market. However, since 2004, impacts of other oil shocks have been significantly weakened or even reversed. For example, the speculative demand shock has helped to stabilize long-term oil volatility during the post-2004 period. The results also suggest the existence of asymmetric impacts on short-term oil volatility, particularly for shocks from oil supply, oil-specific demand and oil speculative demand.",2016-07-22,
A Model of Financialization of Commodities,"ABSTRACT We analyze how institutional investors entering commodity futures markets, referred to as the financialization of commodities, affect commodity prices. Institutional investors care about their performance relative to a commodity index. We find that all commodity futures prices, volatilities, and correlations go up with financialization, but more so for index futures than for nonindex futures. The equity‐commodity correlations also increase. We demonstrate how financial markets transmit shocks not only to futures prices but also to commodity spot prices and inventories. Spot prices go up with financialization, and shocks to any index commodity spill over to all storable commodity prices.",2016-07-13,
"Hedging, Arbitrage, and the Financialization of Commodities Markets",":The article provides an overview of the unfolding of the financialization of commodities in the 2000–2014 time frame. Different phases are described according to the positioning of the group of traders, their motivations, and the type of financial assets used to take a position in commodities. The main theme is the failure of arbitrage to level prices of similar financial assets traded in different markets. However, this failure does not depend on financing constraints suffered by arbitrageurs. Following Mirowski (2010 Mirowski, P. 2010. “Inherent Vice: Minsky, Markomata, and the Tendency of Markets to Undermine Themselves.” Journal of Institutional Economics 6, no. 4: 415–43.[Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) it is shown that arbitrage becomes a form of financial innovation rather than an equilibrating mechanism in contemporary financial markets. Historical accidents and changes in policy affect the positions of groups in the financial market game. The various strategies used are explained by creating a set of T-accounts for the various groups that highlight the winners and the losers in the various phases.",2016-07-02,
Treiben Indexfonds Agrarrohstoffpreise? Nein!,"Der vorliegende Beitrag setzt sich mit der Behauptung auseinander, die hohen Investitionsvolumina von Indexfonds seien für die starken Agrarrohstoffpreissteigerungen der Jahre 2007/2008 und 2010/2011 maßgeblich verantwortlich. Während diese Mutmaßung in der öffentlichen Diskussion als generell akzeptiert galt, zeigt die sachgerechte theoretische und empirische Diskussion, dass Indexfonds nicht als Treiber hoher Agrarrohstoffpreissteigerungen und daher nicht als Verursacher von Hunger in Schwellenländern in Frage kommen. Ferner entbehren strenge regulatorische Forderungen bis hin zu einem Verbot von Indexfonds einer fundierten Grundlage.",2016-07-01,
Riesgo de precio en commodities : ¿profundización en la sensibilidad de precios agrícolas ante shocks de tasa de interés?,"El objetivo de este trabajo es someter a prueba el nivel de sensibilidad del precio de commodities agrícolas frente a shocks en la tasa de interés. El estudio se centrará específicamente en el caso del poroto de soja y del maíz, y mediante un sistema de vectores autorregresivos se evaluará la reacción de los precios ante alteraciones en la tasa de interés. En función de los resultados alcanzados, se esbozan algunas implicaciones que puede tener el proceso, sobre todo en relación con el impacto en países dependientes de la exportación de materias primas. Abstract The aim of this study is to test the sensitivity of the price of agricultural commodities against shocks in the interest rate. The study will focus specifically on the case of soybeans and corn, analyzing if in recent years there have been changes in price sensitivity of prices to changes in interest rates. Using a vector autoregression model we will test the reaction of prices to changes in interest rates.

The Impacts of Speculative Trading on Commodity Prices After the Global Financial Crisis,"본 연구에서는 금융위기 이후 투기적 성향의 거래가 원자재 가격 상승의 주요 요인으로 작용했음을 구조적 벡터자기회귀(SVAR: Structural Vector Auto Regressive) 모형을 이용해 정량적으로 증명했다. SVAR 모형을 추정 후 충격반응 분석과 분산분해 결과에서 금융위기 이후 투기 거래가 원자재 가격에 미친 영향력이 금융위기 전 보다 3~6배 커진 것으로 분석되었다. 또한 금융위기 이후 급증한 글로벌 유동성도 원자재 가격에 영향을 준 것으로 나타났다. 금융위기 이전에는 산업생산 등 수요와 경기 요인이 원자재 가격에 크게 영향을 주었으나 금융위기 이후에는 그 영향력이 감소했다. 따라서 금융위기 이후 원자재 가격 반등은 유동성 확대에 따른 투기 거래 증가에 영향을 받은 것으로 판단할 수 있다. 미국은 2015년 12월 금리 인상을 시작했고 향후 금융 긴축 기조를 지속할 것으로 전망되어 글로벌 유동성이 감소할 가능성이 커지고 있다. 금융위기 이후 원자재 가격이 금융 변수의 영향을 크게 받았기 때문에 향후 유동성이 감소한다면 투기 거래가 위축되고 원자재 가격의 하락 요인으로 작용할 것으로 예상된다. This study verifies whether speculative trading in commodity markets acted as the primary cause of the increase in commodity prices after the global financial crisis using the Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model. The effects of speculative trading on commodity prices increased by a factor of 3 to 6 after the crisis compared to those before the crisis. Although the demand related variables, such as industrial production, affected commodity prices significantly before the crisis, their effects decreased after the crisis. Consequently, the rebound of commodity prices after the crisis was mainly caused by the increase in speculative money, fortified by the expansion of the global liquidity supply. The global liquidity may well increase in the future, because the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is likely to continue to increase its interest rate. This study claims that when global liquidity shrinks as a result of a change in the Fed's monetary policy stance, speculative trading will slow down, leading to a decline in commodity prices.",2016-05-31,
Hedges or safe havens—revisit the role of gold and USD against stock: a multivariate extended skew-<i>t</i>copula approach,"Our paper concerns the question of whether there exist hedge assets during extreme market conditions, which has become increasingly important since the recent financial crisis. This paper develops a novel extended skew-t copula model to examine the effectiveness of gold and US dollar (USD) as hedge or safe haven asset against stock prices for seven developed markets over the 2000–2013 period. Our results indicate the existence of skewness and heavy/thin tails in the distributions of all three types of assets in most of the developed markets, lending support to the employment of flexible distributions to evaluate the tail dependences among assets. We find that USD is preferred to gold as a hedge asset during normal market conditions, while both assets can serve as safe haven assets for most countries when stock markets crash. Our simultaneous analysis of the three assets advises against a joint hedge strategy of gold and USD due to the high tail dependence between them during extreme market conditions. This result highlights the importance of simultaneous modelling of multiple assets in financial risk analysis.",2016-05-24,
DYNAMICS BETWEEN NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL FUTURES PRICES DURING TURMOIL AND FINANCIALIZATION,"ABSTRACT North American and European agricultural futures markets faced significant changes in recent years, i.e., the financialization which originated in the USA, the increase of futures trading in Europe and the recent price turmoils in international commodity markets. We analyse the long‐ and short‐run dynamics between North American and European agricultural futures prices during these institutional changes. The empirical results show that the US markets lead in terms of price transmissions and volatility spillovers. US markets, however, predominantly react to deviations from the long‐run equilibrium which indicates a rising impact of European agricultural markets on a global scale.",2016-05-24,

Investor Interest and the Returns to Commodity Investing,"The authors examine the behavior of monthly commodity futures returns over the decade since 2004, when new investor inflows entered the asset class. They find that average returns have been similar to their long-term historical means. Correlations among commodities and commodity–equity correlations temporarily increased around the financial crisis, but have since returned to normal. This variation is linked to the business cycle rather than the financialization of the asset class. <b>TOPICS:</b>Futures and forward contracts, volatility measures",2016-04-28,
Convenience Yields and Risk Premiums in the EU‐ETS—Evidence from the Kyoto Commitment Period,"Abstract We examine convenience yields and risk premiums in the EU‐wide emissions trading scheme (EU‐ETS) during the first Kyoto commitment period (2008–2012). We find that the market has changed from initial backwardation to contango with significantly negative convenience yields in futures contracts. We further examine the impact of interest rate levels in the Eurozone, the increasing level of surplus allowances and banking, as well as returns, variance, or skewness in the EU‐ETS spot market. Our findings suggest that the drop in risk‐free rates during and after the financial crisis has impacted on the deviation from the cost‐of‐carry relationship for emission allowances (EUA) futures contracts. Our results also illustrate a negative relationship between convenience yields and the increasing level of inventory during the first Kyoto commitment period, providing an explanation for the high negative convenience yields. Finally, we find that market participants are willing to pay an additional risk premium in the futures market for a hedge against increased volatility in EUA prices. Overall, our results contribute to the literature on the determinants and empirical properties of convenience yields and risk premiums for this relatively new class of assets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The transmission from equity markets to commodity markets in crises periods,"This article investigates the transmission from equity markets to commodity markets during two major financial crises, namely the Subprime Mortgage and the Sovereign Debt Crises. We perform an analysis on sub-stages from 3 January 2003 to 31 October 2013 to capture the price behaviour of both equity and commodity markets. Two financial crises indicators, VIX and CDS, are used to represent fear of a crisis. We find that correlations between commodity and equity markets are time-varying and highly volatile during a financial crisis. While sharing some common features, commodities cannot be considered a homogeneous asset class. Segmentation characteristics of commodity markets disappear in times of financial crises, reducing their substitutability as an investment portfolio for asset diversification purposes. Through our test for Granger causality, we find the existence of transmission during a financial crisis. Volatility spillover effect also plays a major role as transmission mechanisms. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, commodities decoupled from the VIX rather soon, and there is an increase in correlation with the CDS. In addition, we find the decoupling effect of most commodities show insignificant correlations with the Dow Jones, VIX and CDS after the Greek debt restructuring.",2016-04-04,
Strategies Based on Momentum and Term Structure in Financialized Commodity Markets,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of the financialization of commodity markets on the profitability of strategies based on momentum and term structure.The performance of an array of portfolios from double-sorts on non-commercial traders' participation, historical returns and term spreads are tested against a risk model.The analysis covers the listing of 26 commodities in the period 1986 -2013.First and foremost, the paper provides a fresh evidence for the validity of strategies based on momentum and term structure investing in commodity markets.Secondly, it proves that term structure strategies generate significantly higher performance results in non-financialized markets.Moreover, it supports the thesis that market financialization adversely affects momentum profits.The results are important in terms of tactical and strategic asset allocation in commodity markets.They imply that investors who implement momentum or term structure based strategies should also consider the composition of market participants.",2016-03-31,
Asymmetric correlations in gold and other financial markets,"In this article, we implement a recently developed statistical method to test asymmetries in cross-asset correlations, focusing in particular on the gold market. Our empirical results provide evidence that gold exhibits asymmetric correlations with stocks and the U.S. dollar, but not with bonds. Furthermore, splitting the sample into three characteristic periods, we find that exceedance correlations exhibit substantial time variation even in similar market tensions for same pairs of assets. Our findings imply that investors and fund managers should take into account the asymmetric dependence structure, which depends on the upside or downside of the market.",2016-03-16,
On the Effects of Commodities Prices on Sustainable Development: An Opportunity?,"Purpose Development is a dynamic concept that pertains the evolution of human societies. Over the past few years policy makers, as well as academics, have incorporated a very important, yet sometimes neglected, component in the concept of development which is environmental costs and sustainability. One of the key aspects that affects sustainability is energetic consumption, therefore our aim is to determine if changes in oil, coal, and gas, prices during the period 2000–2010 influenced sustainable development.",2016-03-01,

Crude Oil and Agricultural Futures: An Analysis of Correlation Dynamics,"Abstract Correlations between oil and agricultural commodities have varied over previous decades, impacted by renewable fuels policy and turbulent economic conditions. We estimate smooth transition conditional correlation models for 12 agricultural commodities and WTI crude oil. While a structural change in correlations occurred concurrently with the introduction of biofuel policy, oil and food price levels are also key influences. High correlation between biofuel feedstocks and oil is more likely to occur when food and oil price levels are high. Correlation with oil returns is strong for biofuel feedstocks, unlike with other agricultural futures, suggesting limited contagion from energy to food markets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Conditional price volatility, speculation, and excessive speculation in commodity markets: sheep or shepherd behaviour?","The present study aims to investigate the dynamics of primary commodity spot prices and the role of speculation for the period 1995–2012. Using a linear and nonlinear Granger causality analysis, the relationship between speculation and GARCH conditional price volatility on the one side, and the linkage between excessive speculation and GARCH conditional price volatility on the other side, is carefully examined with the scope to establish whether volatility drives speculation or speculation drives price volatility, or whether there are no linkages between the two variables. The results show that excessive speculation leads conditional price volatility, and that bilateral relationships often exist between price volatility and speculation. In addition, the lead-lag relationships are not found for the entire sample period, but rather when small sub-periods are taken into account. It turns out, in fact, that excessive speculation has driven price volatility for maize, rice, soybeans, and wheat in particular time frames, but the relationships are not always overlapping for all considered commodities. Generally, the results under linear causality tests are in agreement with those obtained under nonlinear counterparts.",2016-01-12,
Locating financialization in a less-developed economy: Micro responses to liberalization and volatility in Pakistan,"Drawing on fieldwork findings in homes and marketplaces in Pakistan, the article identifies processes of financialization in a small, open, low-income and fragile state. The article locates empirical responses to financialization in the creation of new speculative asset markets and in new forms of financialized behavior, reflecting new forms of financialized risk. In establishing links between the volatility that arises with liberalization in a context of financialized globalization and the financialization of everyday economic strategies and of certain markets, the analysis pivots around the relationship between risk and money. The article thereby contributes to the financialization literature, taking as a starting point the volatility that the financialization of global markets instills in prices as domestic money itself takes on the volatile pricing patterns of a financialized market. Financialization here plays itself out not in terms of the financial norms of advanced economies but in terms of the specific institutional context of a low-income economy.",2016-01-08,

The papers strongly differ in terms of the focus variable (e.g. price, volatility, spillover effects) of speculative effects, the speculation measure used, and their methodological sophistication and quality. We review and evaluate the methodology and results of 100 papers which have been published (or are at least frequently quoted) on this subject over the past decade. While the overall picture indicates that the number of studies which report reinforcing and weakening effects is about the same, the results shift in favor of finding (clear or mixed) weakening effects if studies use direct measures of speculation.",2016-01-01,

The Volatility of Oil Prices: What Factors?,"This paper highlights a new articulation between the physical fundamentals of the oil market, the traditional financial factors and the emergence of recent financial fundamentals to explain WTI crude oil price volatility over the period 1995 M1 and 2013 M12. A first vector error correction model (VECM) identifies a co - integration relationship between WTI spot price, the import and inventory of crude oil in the United States, the dollar index and the 5-year US interest rate. A second model with the introduction of the future prices at two months and kcfsi index. The result of our work shows a low correlation of import and inventory of crude oil in the United States with respect to short-term oil prices. But in contrast to a strong long-term correlation. The introduction of speculation and KCFSI index affects the oil price dynamics in the long and short-term. The two traditional financial factors (dollar index and the 5-year US interest rate) are found to be weakly exogenous in the long run.",2016-01-01,
Which Risk Factors Drive Oil Futures Price Curves? Speculation and Hedging in the Short and Long-Term,"Supplementary material available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3312707We develop extensions that introduce regression structure to the multi-factor stochastic models of commodity futures price term structure dynamics. We demonstrate the accuracy with which these models can be calibrated to oil futures data and how they improve on existing models both in model fit and in model interpretation. We found leading observable factors that contribute to explaining the term structure of oil futures, in the presence of long and short term stochastic factors, included the dollar index, inventories, commodity indices and risk aversion associated to financial intermediaries. Furthermore, we determine the time frame on which these factors are explanatory.",2016-01-01,
"Foods, Fuels or Finances: Which Prices Matter for Biofuels?","We examine co-movements between biofuels and a wide range of commodities and assets in the US, Europe, and Brazil. We analyze a unique dataset of 33 commodities and relevant assets (between 2003 and 2016) which is unprecedented in the biofuels literature. We combine the minimum spanning trees correlation filtration to detect the most important connections of the broad analyzed system with continuous wavelet analysis which allows for studying dynamic connections between biofuels and relevant commodities and assets and their frequency characteristics as well. We confirm that for the Brazilian and US ethanol, their respective feed-stock commodities lead the prices of biofuels, and not vice versa. This dynamics remains qualitatively unchanged when controlling for the influence of crude oil prices. As opposed to the Brazilian and US ethanol, the European biodiesel exhibits only moderate ties to its production factors. We show that financial factors do not significantly interact with biofuel prices.",2016-01-01,
Did the Renewable Fuel Standard Shift Market Expectations of the Price of Ethanol?,"It is commonly believed that the response of the price of corn ethanol (and hence of the price of corn) to shifts in biofuel policies operates in part through market expectations and shifts in storage demand, yet to date it has proved difficult to measure these expectations and to empirically evaluate this view. We utilize a recently proposed methodology to estimate the marketâ€™s expectations of the prices of ethanol, unfinished motor gasoline and crude oil at horizons from three months to one year. We quantify the extent to which price changes were anticipated by the market, the extent to which they were unanticipated, and how the risk premium in these markets has evolved. We show that the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is likely to have increased ethanol price expectations by as much $1.45 in the year before and in the year after the implementation of the RFS had started. Our analysis of the term structure of expectations provides support for the view that a shift in ethanol storage demand starting in 2005 caused an increase in the price of ethanol. There is no conclusive evidence that the tightening of the RFS in 2008 shifted market expectations, but our analysis suggests that policy uncertainty about how to deal with the blend wall raised the risk premium in the ethanol futures market in mid-2013 by as much as 50 cents at longer horizons. Finally, we present evidence against a tight link from ethanol price expectations to corn price expectations and hence to storage demand for corn in 2005-06.",2016-01-01,
A Multifactor Stochastic Volatility Model of Commodity Prices,"We propose a novel representation of commodity spot prices in which the cost-of-carry and the spot price volatility are both driven by an arbitrary number of risk factors, nesting many existing specifications. The model exhibits unspanned stochastic volatility, provides simple closed-form expressions of commodity futures, and yields analytic formulas of European options on futures. We estimate the model using oil futures and options data, and find that the pricing of traded contracts is accurate for a wide range of maturities and strike prices. The results suggest that at least three risk factors in the spot price volatility are needed to accurately fit the volatility surface of options on oil futures, highlighting the importance of using general multifactor models in pricing commodity contingent claims.",2016-01-01,
Increasing Trends in the Excess Comovement of Commodity Prices,"We investigate how the excess comovement of commodity prices, that is, the correlation in commodity returns after filtering out common fundamental shocks, has changed over the past three decades by developing the smooth-transition dynamic conditional correlation model that can capture long-run trends and short-run dynamics of correlation simultaneously. Using data from 1983 to 2011, we find that significant increasing longrun trends in excess comovement have appeared since around 2000. We confirm that these increasing trends are neither an artifact of the financial crisis after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 nor the time-varying sensitivities of commodity returns to common fundamental shocks. Moreover, we find that no significant increasing trends exist in the excess comovement among off-index commodities and that the surge of global demand alone cannot explain the increasing trends. These findings provide additional evidence for the timing and scope of the recent increasing commodity-return correlations that suggest the influence of the financialization of commodity markets starting around 2000.",2016-01-01,
Optimal Data Histories for Forecasting Correlations,"Forecasting correlations between stocks and commodities is important for diversification across asset classes and other risk management decisions. Correlations forecasts are affected by model uncertainty, sources of which can include uncertainty about changing fundamentals and associated parameters (model instability), structural breaks and non-linearities due, for example, to regime switching. We use approaches that weight historical data according to their predictive content. Specifically, we estimate two alternative models, 'time-varying weights' and 'time-varying window' in order to maximize the value of past data for forecasting. Our empirical analyses reveal that these approaches provide superior forecasts to several benchmark models for forecasting correlations.",2016-01-01,
Asset Allocation: A Recommendation for Resolving the Collision between Theory and Practice,"We examine the creation of a low-cost optimal risky portfolio that individual investors can easily construct and manage. We consider five index mutual funds and three precious metals that are easy for investors to trade. Collectively, the mutual funds track the returns of the entire U.S. equity market, 98% of foreign stocks, U.S. investment grade bonds, all domestic REITs, and emerging markets. The three precious metals are gold, platinum, and palladium. Because these mutual funds are available in ETF form, we provide optimization results with and without short selling. Optimization results differ greatly from conventional wisdom regarding optimal asset allocation.

Crude Inventory Accounting and Speculation in the Physical Oil Market,"This paper uses inventory data from financial accounts to explore whether companies involved in the physical oil market were speculating in the run-up to 2008. Using quarterly inventory data over the period 1990Q4 to 2012Q1 and a sample of 15 of the largest listed oil companies in the world, we derive an Index of Scaled Physical Inventories (ISPI). We find declining ISPI up to the early 2000s is consistent with firms minimizing inventory for efficiency sake; then ISPI starts to increase, suggesting physical inventories could have contributed to the run-up in oil prices between 2003 and 2008. Highlighting heterogeneity in inventory behaviors amongst the large oil companies, the structural break test on the ratio of inventory to sales and the days to sales for individual companies shows that five companies had positive structural breaks during the speculation period, while the other companies had no or negative structural breaks. Contrary to declining inventory expectations due to a tightening oil market, the positive structural breaks suggest speculative behavior. We also examine the relationship between changes in profitability and changes in oil inventory over the pre-speculation and speculation period. Though some coefficients for inventory do switch from negative to positive over the two periods as hypothesized, they are only significant in a few cases. However, aggregate measures of inventory do switch and are significant, suggesting that, on average, inventory holdings negatively affected profitability in the pre-speculation period and positively affected profitability in the speculation period.",2016-01-01,

Understanding the Non-Convergence of Agricultural Futures Via Stochastic Storage Costs and Timing Options,"This paper studies the market phenomenon of non-convergence between futures and spot prices in the grains market. We postulate that the positive basis observed at maturity stems from the futures holder’s timing options to exercise the shipping certificate delivery item and subsequently liquidate the physical grain. In our proposed approach, we incorporate stochastic spot price and storage cost, and solve an optimal double stopping problem to give the optimal strategies to exercise and liquidate the grain. Our new models for stochastic storage rates lead to explicit no-arbitrage prices for the shipping certificate and associated futures contract. We calibrate our models to empirical futures data during the periods of observed non-convergence, and illustrate the premium generated by the shipping certificate.",2016-01-01,
An Equilibrium Model for Spot and Forward Prices of Commodities,"We consider a market model that consists of financial investors and producers of a commodity. Producers optionally store some production for future sale and go short on forward contracts to hedge the uncertainty of the future commodity price. Financial investors take positions in these contracts in order to diversify their portfolios. The spot and forward equilibrium commodity prices are endogenously derived as the outcome of the interaction between producers and investors. Assuming that both are utility maximizers, we first prove the existence of an equilibrium in an abstract setting. Then, in a framework where the consumers' demand and the exogenously priced financial market are correlated, we provide semi-explicit expressions for the equilibrium prices and analyze their dependence on the model parameters. The model can explain why increased investors' participation in forward commodity markets and higher correlation between the commodity and the stock market could result in higher spot prices and lower forward premia.",2016-01-01,

While fundamental news remain an important source of information for market partici-pants in grain futures markets, the results of this analysis reveal that the information content of traders' positions from the Commitments of Traders (COT) report has gained importance in the corn and wheat futures market. The impact of traders' positions seems to be more pronounced in grain futures markets, where the presence of commodity index traders is higher and those of professional speculators (money managers) lower.",2016-01-01,

Financialization and Structural Changes in Agricultural Markets During the Early XXIst Century,"The main goal of the study is a critical review of the literature on the implications of financialization of agricultural commodity markets during the first decade of the XXI st century. Early studies suggest that inflow of speculative portfolio investments was the key driver of agricultural price increases and also contributed to the sharp increase in the co-movements of prices between agricultural sector and equity markets as well as oil market. Access to the more detailed investors data, available since 2010, as well as observations from post-crisis world economy, point to a much broader range of factors contributing to price formulation in agricommodity markets and to a much smaller influence of financial investors.",2015-12-18,

Trends in stock-bond correlations,"Previous studies document the existence of long-run trends in comovements in the stock and bond markets. Following these findings, this article examines possible trends in stock-bond return correlations. To this end, we introduce a trend component into a smooth transition regression (STR) model including the multiple transition variables of Aslanidis and Christiansen (2012). The results indicate the existence of significant decreasing trends in stock-bond correlations for many advanced safer countries. In addition, although stock market volatility continues to be an important factor in stock-bond correlations, the short rate and yield spread become only marginally significant once we introduce the trend component. Our out-of-sample analysis also demonstrates that the STR model, including the volatility index and time trend as the transition variables, dominates other models. Furthermore, we find a significant increase in stock-bond correlations for riskier euro countries around the beginning of the euro crisis. Our findings of decreasing and increasing trends in stock-bond correlations can be considered a consequence of the decreasing effects of diversification and more intensive flight-to-quality behaviour that have taken place in recent years and after the euro crisis.",2015-09-25,

Predicting Commodity‐futures Basis Factor Return by Basis Spread,Abstract A growing body of literature confirms the significance of the commodity futures basis factor. It has a significantly positive premium and it explains the cross‐section of commodity‐futures excess returns. We extend the literature by documenting the predictive relation between this factor and the inter‐quartile spread in the basis; the predictability of the basis factor return has not been previously reported. From the simple regression analysis of the historical commodity futures data we show that the basis spread is a strong predictor of the basis factor return. We discuss the implication of this finding on the nature of the basis factor; we also discuss the market timing strategies based on the basis spread.,2015-08-01,
"Fundamentals, Derivatives Market Information and Oil Price Volatility","We analyze empirically what drives market expectations of crude oil price volatility. Between 2000 and 2014, we investigate the links between the term structure of oil option‐implied volatilities (IVs) and global macroeconomic conditions, physical market fundamentals (OPEC surplus output capacity, oil storage) and economy‐wide financial conditions (captured by the equity VIX). The VIX and the constraints affecting oil output or inventories have statistically and economically significant explanatory power for the short‐dated oil IVs and for the WTI IV term structure. After controlling for the VIX, in contrast, macroeconomic variables and a measure of speculative activity based on public data are both insignificant. Our model, which outperforms a benchmark ARIMA specification both in and out of sample, suggests an approach for studying volatility in asset markets that behave as satellites to other markets.

The Case for Long-Short Commodity Investing,"The article presents strong evidence in favor of long-short (as opposed to long-only) commodity investments. We show that long-short fully collateralized commodity portfolios based on momentum, term structure or hedging pressure present higher Sharperatios, lower volatility and lower correlation with the S&amp;P 500 index than long-only commodity portfolios. Besides long-short hedging pressure portfolios serve as partial hedge against extreme equity risk as they present decreasing correlations with the S&amp;P 500 index in periods of heightened equity volatility. This is good news to equity investors: it is precisely when the volatility of equity markets is high that the benefits of diversification are most appreciated. In contrast, the conditional correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and long-only commodity indices substantially rises with the S&amp;P 500 volatility, suggesting that the risk diversification of long-only commodity portfolios prevails less when needed most. <b>TOPICS:</b>Commodities, portfolio construction, risk management, statistical methods",2015-06-30,
Is Financialization Killing Commodity Investments?,"The financialization of commodity markets has recently become a broadly discussed phenomenon, but its implications for commodity investors to a large extent remain unknown. This article focuses on whether the potential benefits of passive investment strategies in the commodity futures markets are expected to continue with increased financialization of the commodity futures markets. First, a regression analysis is conducted in order to examine the correlation between financialization and the disappearance of roll yields. Second, after finding such a correlation, we assume that this correlation is driven by increased financialization, which <i>causes</i> the decline in roll yields. Third, simulation-based methods are implemented to examine the revised efficient frontiers after accounting for the potential impact of financialization on roll yields. Our empirical research is based on returns on various asset classes and other related variables over the period 1990–2012. As noted, our computations indicate that market financialization may have resulted in a decline in roll returns. This decrease in roll yields, should it continue, is of a potential magnitude such that therationale for including commodity futures in traditional stock-and-bond portfolios would be seriously undermined. <b>TOPICS:</b>Commodities, futures and forward contracts, simulations, performance measurement",2015-06-30,
Facts and Fantasies about Commodity Futures Ten Years Later,"Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006) examined commodity futures returns over the period July 1959 to December 2004 based on an equally-weighted index.They found that fully collateralized commodity futures had historically offered the same return and Sharpe ratio as U.S. equities, but were negatively correlated with the return on stocks and bonds.Reviewing these results ten years later, we find that our conclusions largely hold up out-of-sample.The in-and out-of-sample average commodity risk premiums are not significantly different, nor is the cross-sectional relationship between average returns and the basis.Correlations among commodities and commodity correlations with other assets experienced a temporary increase during the financial crisis which is in line with historical experience of variation of these correlations over the business cycle.",2015-06-01,
Concentrated Production and Conditional Heavy Tails in Commodity Returns,"Abstract I study the impact of commodity production concentration on the occurrence of extreme commodity returns. I explore this issue in a sample of 22 agricultural, mineral and energy commodities of global scope that are liquidly traded through futures at the most important exchanges. I find that measures of production concentration such as the Herfindahl index computed on national shares of global output, or the market share of the top three producers, had significant and positive effect on measures of extreme returns during 1995–2012, as implied by daily return kurtosis or the shape parameter of the distribution of extreme returns. Volatility persistence appears unlikely to generate the cross sectional kurtosis observed empirically unless heavy tailed conditional returns are also included in the dynamics. The results are economically significant and robust to the inclusion of controls for inventories, futures liquidity, and country size. These findings are consistent with a simple mechanism of aggregation of globally distributed local supply shocks that impact global supply and hence commodity prices. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Commodity futures returns: more memory than you might think!<sup>†</sup>,"This paper investigates long-range dependence in 14 commodity and 3 other financial futures returns series from 1993 to 2009 and shows that long memory is a pervasive phenomenon in contrast to the extant evidence. Utilizing a semi-parametric wavelet-based estimator with time windows, the results provide overwhelming evidence of time-varying long-range dependence in all futures returns series. Structural break tests indicate multiple regimes of dependence, in the majority of which the persistence parameter is statistically significant. The results also provide evidence of predominantly negative parameter values which are known as anti-persistence. The latter is consistent with investor overreaction to shocks and suggests temporary departures from market efficiency.",2015-04-15,
Macroeconomic impacts on commodity prices: China vs. the United States,"This study compares the macroeconomic impacts of China and the United States on international commodity markets using a factor-augmented vector auto-regression (FAVAR) model with latent factors extracted from a rich data set that includes various macroeconomic and financial indicators at monthly frequency. The main results suggest that whether or not the Chinese demand cause commodity prices to soar depends. Macroeconomic factors of China do have significant impact on commodity markets, but the impacts of the United States outperform those of China in terms of the size of coefficients and their level of significance, as well as the direction and magnitude of directional return spillovers. Moreover, the effects of these factors on individual commodity futures are not a universal phenomenon. Therefore, there is no systematic evidence of a relationship between strong growth in the emerging economy and the boom in commodity futures prices, either statistically or economically.",2015-03-24,
Booms and Busts in Commodity Markets: Bubbles or Fundamentals?,"Abstract This paper considers whether there were periodically collapsing rational speculative bubbles in commodity prices over a 40‐year period from the late 1960s. We apply a switching regression approach to a broad range of commodities using two different measures of fundamental values—estimated from convenience yields and from a set of macroeconomic factors believed to affect commodity demand. We find reliable evidence for bubbles only among crude oil and feeder cattle, showing the popular belief that the extreme price movements observed in commodity markets were caused by pure speculation to be unsustainable. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Does Futures Speculation Destabilize Commodity Markets?,"This paper examines how increased speculator participation in the commodity futures market affects market outcomes, including trades' price impacts, price volatility, and market quality. Contrary to the popular belief that speculators are responsible for the recent commodity price fluctuation, my analysis finds no evidence that speculators destabilize the commodity spot market. Instead, speculators contribute to lower price volatility, enhanced price efficiency, and better liquidity in the commodity markets. More importantly, I show that speculators either have no effect or stabilize prices during periods of large price movement. My findings suggest speculators have had a significant and in fact positive influence on the commodity market during the recent “financialization” period, implying that restricting speculative trading in the futures market is not an efficient way to stabilize the commodity market. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

<i>Financialization of food</i>. Modelling the time-varying relation between agricultural prices and stock market dynamics,"This article studies the correlation of agricultural prices with stock market dynamics. We discuss the possible role of financial and macroeconomic factors in driving this time-varying relation, with the aim of understanding what caused positive correlation between agricultural commodities and stocks in recent years. While previous works on commodity-equity correlation have focused on broad commodity indices, we study 16 agricultural prices, in order to assess patterns that are specific to agricultural commodities but also differences across markets. We show that an explanation based on a combination of financialization and financial crisis is consistent with the empirical evidence in most markets, while global demand factors don't appear to play a significant role. The correlation between agricultural prices and stock market returns tends to increase during periods of financial turmoil. The impact of financial turmoil on the correlation gets stronger as the share of financial investors in agricultural derivatives markets rises. Our findings suggest that the influence of financial shocks on agricultural prices should decrease as global financial tensions settle down but also that, as long as agricultural markets are 'financialized', it might rise again when it is less needed, i.e. in the presence of new financial turmoil.",2015-03-13,
Informational Frictions and Commodity Markets,"ABSTRACT This paper develops a model with a tractable log‐linear equilibrium to analyze the effects of informational frictions in commodity markets. By aggregating dispersed information about the strength of the global economy among goods producers whose production has complementarity, commodity prices serve as price signals to guide producers' production decisions and commodity demand. Our model highlights important feedback effects of informational noise originating from supply shocks and futures market trading on commodity demand and spot prices. Our analysis illustrates the weakness common in empirical studies on commodity markets of assuming that different types of shocks are publicly observable to market participants.",2015-03-09,
Commodity market risk from 1995 to 2013: an extreme value theory approach,"In this article we examine whether extreme risk has increased in the agricultural commodity market during the period 1995–2013. We add to the literature on food price volatility by analysing the tail segment of futures price return distributions. Food price variability is a concern for governments and regulators worldwide, as most nations trade in food. High food price variability can contribute to poverty and malnourishment, in particular for people in less economically developed economies. We find no indications of systematically increasing tail-risk for the commodities in our sample. Analysis of estimated shape-parameters of the Generalized Extreme Value distribution further supports the conclusion that there is no general systematic change in the extreme risk associated with these commodity investments.",2015-02-16,
Volatility Spillovers Across Petroleum Markets,"By using our newly defined measure, we detect and quantify asymmetries in the volatility spillovers of petroleum commodities: crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil. The increase in volatility spillovers after 2001 correlates with the progressive fin-ancialization of the commodities. Further, increasing spillovers from volatility among petroleum commodities substantially change their pattern after 2008 (the financial crisis and advent of tight oil production). After 2008, asymmetries in spillovers markedly declined in terms of total as well as directional spillovers. In terms of asymmetries we also show that overall volatility spillovers due to negative (price) returns materialize to a greater degree than volatility spillovers due to positive returns. An analysis of directional spillovers reveals that no petroleum commodity dominates other commodities in terms of general spillover transmission.",2015-01-30,
EFFECTS OF INDEX‐FUND INVESTING ON COMMODITY FUTURES PRICES,"We develop a simple model of futures arbitrage that implies that if purchases by commodity index funds influence futures prices, then the notional positions of the index investors should help predict excess returns in these contracts. We find no evidence that the positions of index traders in agricultural contracts as identified by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission can help predict returns on the near futures contracts. Although there is some support that these positions might help predict changes in oil futures prices over 2006–2009, the relation breaks down out of sample.",2015-01-23,
Portfolio Diversification with Commodities in Times of Financialization,"The study concentrates on the benefits of passive commodity investments in the context of the phenomenon of financialization. The research investigates the implications of increase in the correlation coefficients between equity and commodity investments for investors in financial markets. The paper is composed of several parts. First, the attributes of commodity investments and their benefits in the portfolio optimization are explored. Second, the phenomenon of the financialization is described and the research hypothesis is developed. Next, an empirical analysis is performed. I simulate the mean-variance spanning tests to examine the benefits of commodity investments before and after accounting for the impact of financialization. I proceed separate analysis for pre- and post-financialization period. The empirical research is based on asset classes’ returns and other related variables from years 1991-2012. The performed investigations indicate that the market financialization may have significant implications for commodity investors. Due to increase in correlation coefficients, the inclusion of the commodity futures in the traditional stock-bond portfolio appears to be no longer reasonable.",2015-01-21,

Common Factors in Commodity Futures Curves,"Literature studying comovement in commodity prices provides mixed evidence for whether commodity markets are segmented or driven by common factors. We provide a joint framework to study comovement across 24 of the most traded commodities over 20 years. The framework benefits from using the whole commodity futures curve, not just the nearest futures contract. Using all curve data we find that there is a strong comovement, though this is mostly due to sector commonalities. Furthermore, the importance of a common market factor is overestimated when using only the nearest futures data. Both these findings shed light on the contradicting conclusions in existing literature. Additionally we find that the importance of the common factors varies over time, with a stronger factor structure arising in recent years.",2015-01-01,
The Financialization of Food?,"Commodity-equity return co-movements rose dramatically during the Great Recession. This development took place following what has been dubbed the ""financialization"" of commodity markets. We first document changes since 1995 in the relative importance of financial institutions' activity in agricultural futures markets. We then use a structural VAR model to ascertain the role of that activity in explaining correlations between weekly grain, livestock, and equity returns in 1995-2015. We provide robust evidence that, accounting for shocks which are idiosyncratic to agricultural markets, world business cycle shocks have a substantial and long-lasting impact on the latter's co-movements with financial markets. In contrast, changes in the intensity of financial speculation have an impact on cross-market return linkages that is shorter-lived and not statistically significant in all model specifications.",2015-01-01,
Comovement and Financialization in the Commodity Market,"Over the last two decades, commodity indices have been increasingly used to achieve investment portfolio diversification. At the same time, the rise in the popularity of these indices has prompted questions on whether commodities remained segmented from traditional financial asset markets, which can affect diversification decisions. Using futures data from 1998 to 2017 for 25 US-traded commodities, we find a statistically significant increase in comovement among non-energy index-commodities. This increase is only temporary. In contrast, no change in comovement is observed for off-index commodities over the entire period. Off-commodities, in other words, are the only one remaining segmented. Our results are robust to alternative explanations – non-trading effects and common supply characteristics. The analysis of high-frequency returns dynamics reinforces the results. Such comovement ‘index effect’ is in line with the predictions of theoretical models of the financialization of commodity markets and consistent with the role of style investing.",2015-01-01,
Liquidity Timing in Commodity Markets and the Impact of Financialization,We study the returns to a simple trend following strategy in commodity futures markets and their drivers. Returns correlate positively to calendar spread liquidity and constraints on intermediation capital. The strategy delivers low annualized excess returns in the period from 1990 to 2004 of -0.02% that increase significantly from 2005 to 2015 to 3.65% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.1. This increase in returns coincides with increased participation in commodity markets by financial investors who use futures to maintain constant commodity market exposure but must periodically rebalance their futures maturity risk. This rebalancing creates predictable demand for liquidity. We also apply the strategy to a group of commodities not strongly affected by financialization and a set of financial futures and document no different behavior in these groups over the two parts of our sample.,2015-01-01,
A Financialization Model of Crude Oil Markets,"This paper theoretically and empirically investigates the financialization of crude oil markets. We propose a simple correlation model between stock and crude oil prices based on the supply and demand relationship taking into account the impact of stock markets on crude oil markets. Based on the correlation model, the optimal allocations of stock, crude oil and a risk free asset are obtained by solving the Merton’s problem under the assumption of a log utility function. By using the price correlation model it is empirically shown that the correlations between S&P 500 and WTI crude oil prices are positive and increasing. In contrast, the correlations between S&P 500 and Brent crude oil prices are close to zero, which are lower than the correlations between S&P 500 and WTI crude oil prices. It may suggest that the financialization of crude oil markets be limited to WTI crude oil markets. The optimal allocations of S&P 500, WTI or Brent crude oil and a risk free asset are empirically obtained based on the correlation model. It is shown that after the 2008 financial turmoil the optimal WTI crude oil positions decrease in line with the optimal S&P 500 positions while the optimal Brent crude oil positions are not relevant to the optimal S&P 500 positions. The results may suggest that after the 2008 financial turmoil WTI crude oil be financialized and do not show the diversification effect to S&P 500 while Brent crude oil be not the case. These results are fully supported by the other empirical studies using the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002). Additional empirical studies using crude oil and natural gas prices based on the DCC model suggest that WTI crude oil prices have higher correlations with the US natural gas prices than Brent crude oil prices, implying that WTI crude oil markets still have strong impacts on the other energy markets while the financialization of WTI crude oil has recently proceeded.",2015-01-01,
Big Fish: Oil Markets and Speculation,"The role of speculators in the oil markets has been vastly investigated during the last few years. Several authors focused on the definition of speculation while others examined the relationship between oil prices and the behavior of trading actors. In this paper, we formulate a new theory able to describe ""hedging needs"" as well as the role of speculators in the crude oil market. According to our model, the different strategies of producers and consumers aimed at defending themselves against abrupt oil price changes can be satisfied only if speculators play a very active role. Due to the rapid growth in shale oil production, the importance of speculation in ensuring an equilibrium in the U.S. crude oil market has consequently grown noticeably. We estimate an econometric conditional Error Correction Model (ECM) applying Pesaran's bound tests, over the sample February 2000 November 2014, using WTI and CFTC data. Our theory is well supported by econometric evidence. In other words, our model is suitable to demonstrate how commercial operators act on the market. In addition, the increasing importance of future contracts (also known as financialisation of crude oil market) helps in reaching a level of prices close to the equilibrium one. Finally, we are able to find evidence of a positive impact of the action of speculators on the efficiency of oil markets as they help stabilizing prices.",2015-01-01,
"Realized Correlations, Betas and Volatility Spillover in the Commodity Market: What Has Changed?","This paper examines the changes in price and return dynamics that affected the commodity market around the 2007-2008 boom&bust. Relying on data at intra-day frequency and adapting the recently proposed realized Beta GARCH model of Hansen et. al (J. Appl. Econ.(2014)), it is shown that starting from 2006 realized correlations between agricultural commodities belonging to the same group and between agriculturals and oil have significantly increased. The rise in correlations between grains - or soft commodities - and oil is especially notable. The dynamics of the volatility spillover across commodities are also investigated. It is found that spillover effects became more evident prior to the commodity price crash. However, this increase in volatility transmission tented to anticipate the increase in correlations. To conclude, it is shown that the optimal ratio of a short position on oil required to hedge a 1$ long position in an agricultural commodity, which corresponds to the the model realized beta, also increased significantly after 2006. This finding has important implication in terms of portfolio hedging and risk management.",2015-01-01,
Limits to Financialization of a Production Firm,"Should commodity producers that engage in trading keep production and trading operations together or divide them into separate entities? A joint firm can substitute production with trading when switching capacity is expensive, and use the shared balance sheet to exploit trading opportunities. However, a joint firm unable to ring-fence a profitable operation, and is vulnerable to shocks in one operation that contaminates the other. Trading to support and hedge production adds value. Trading to expand the profits of the company must be limited below a threshold. Excessive trading is characterized by its scope in the joint firm.",2015-01-01,
Do Commodities Provide Diversification Benefits? A Stochastic Dominance Efficiency Approach,We revisit the question whether commodities should be included in investors' portfolios. We employ for the first time a stochastic dominance efficiency (SDE) approach to construct optimal portfolios with and without commodities and we evaluate their comparative performance. SDE circumvents the necessity to posit a specific utility function to describe investor's preferences and it does not impose distributional assumptions on asset returns. We find that commodities provide diversification benefits both in- and out-of-sample. This evidence is stronger when commodity indices which mimic dynamic commodity trading strategies are used. We explain our results by documenting that commodity markets are segmented from the equity and bond markets.,2015-01-01,
Output Value Risk for Commodity Producers: The Uncertain Benefits of Diversification,"Commodity price volatility has long been recognized as a main risk for commodity producers' welfare and has led to diversification efforts. Less noticed has been the importance of commodity correlations, and their increase after 2006, in the risk faced by producers. To assess their impact, we perform an empirical analysis of the market value of commodity producers' output. In a sample of 56 countries producing 26 commodities we find that diversification and correlations strongly explain output value volatility. Between 1987 and 2006, producers effectively specialized in a single commodity had an average output value volatility of 27.0% while producers of three or more commodities had a 12.7% volatility. In this period average correlation was 8% and diversification was very effective. In the 2007-2012 period, correlations averaged 26% and output volatilities for specialized and diversified commodities were 30.4% and 19.5% respectively, thus reducing the benefit of diversification at a time of macroeconomic distress. In 2013-2016, output volatilities reverted to levels close to those in 1987-2006 as commodities decorrelated again. Our findings should be relevant to policy makers embarking in diversification efforts and in the analysis of macroeconomic risk of commodity producers.",2015-01-01,
Diversifying Portfolios of U.S. Stocks with Crude Oil and Natural Gas: A Regime-Dependent Optimization with Several Risk Measures,"Energy markets are strategic to governments and economic development. Several commodities compete as substitutable energy sources and energy diversifiers. Such competition reduces the energy vulnerability of countries as well as portfolios’ risk exposure. Vulnerability results mainly from price trends and fluctuations, following supply and demand shocks. Such energy price uncertainty attracts many market participants in the energy commodity markets. First, energy producers and consumers hedge adverse price changes with energy derivatives. Second, financial market participants use commodities and commodity derivatives to diversify their conventional portfolios. For that reason, we consider the joint dependence between the United States (U.S.) natural gas, crude oil and stock markets. We use Gatfaoui’s (2015) time varying multivariate copula analysis and related variance regimes. Such approach handles structural changes in asset prices. In this light, we draw implications for portfolio optimization, when investors diversify their stock portfolios with natural gas and crude oil assets. We minimize the portfolio’s variance, semi-variance and tail risk, in the presence and the absence of constraints on the portfolio’s expected return and/or U.S. stock investment. The return constraint reduces the performance of the optimal portfolio. Moreover, the regime-specific portfolio optimization helps implement an enhanced active management strategy over the whole sample period. Under a return constraint, the semi-variance optimal portfolio offers the best risk-return tradeoff, whereas the tail-risk optimal portfolio offers the best tradeoff in the absence of a return constraint.",2015-01-01,
Comovement Revisited,"Recent evidence of excessive comovement among stocks following index additions (Barberis, Shleifer, and Wurgler, 2005) and stock splits (Green and Hwang, 2009) challenges traditional finance theory. Based on a simple model, we show that the bivariate regressions relied upon in the literature often provide little or no information about the economic magnitude of the phenomenon of interest, and the coefficients in these regressions are very sensitive to time-variation in the characteristics of the return processes that are unrelated to excess comovement. Instead, univariate regressions of the stock return on the returns of the group it is leaving (e.g., non-S&P stocks) and the group it is joining (e.g., S&P stocks) reveal the relevant information. When we reexamine the empirical evidence using control samples matched on past returns and compute Dimson betas, almost all evidence of excess comovement disappears. The results in the literature are consistent with changes in the fundamental factor loadings of the stocks. One key element to understanding these striking results is that, in both the examples we study, the stocks exhibit strong returns prior to the event in question. We document the heretofore unknown empirical regularity that winner stocks exhibit increases in betas. Thus, much of the apparent excess comovement is just a manifestation of momentum.",2015-01-01,
A Tale for Two Tails: Explaining Extreme Events in Financialized Agricultural Markets,"The substantial booms and busts in agricultural prices marked by extreme events across commodities lead to heated debates about the effects of speculative trading on commodity price fluctuations. This study proposes a new approach to understanding extreme events and boom-bust processes in agricultural markets. Using weekly futures data for seven indexed agricultural commodities during 2006 to 2014, we find that extreme price changes, located in the 10% tails of the distribution, cluster across agricultural markets. We then implement a multinomial logit model to investigate which factors are associated with the propagation of extreme events. Specifically, we disentangle three transmission conduits. (1) The macroeconomic conduit captures the possibility that the synchronized extreme price events are triggered by business-cycle driven demand shifts mainly in emerging economies. (2) The financial conduit refers to potential links between extreme returns and the increasing flow of money from financial participants into agricultural futures markets. (3) Finally, the energy conduit accounts for possible spillover effects due to oil price shocks and the demand for biofuels. Our results indicate an important role of managed money positions and ethanol prices while the real demand channel remains mostly insignificant.",2015-01-01,
Volatility Spillovers Across Petroleum Markets,"By using our newly defined measure, we detect and quantify asymmetries in the volatility spillovers of petroleum commodities: crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil.

Further, increasing spillovers from volatility among petroleum commodities substantially change their pattern after 2008 (the financial crisis and advent of tight oil production). After 2008, asymmetries in spillovers markedly declined in terms of total as well as directional spillovers. In terms of asymmetries we also show that overall volatility spillovers due to negative (price) returns materialize to a greater degree than volatility spillovers due to positive returns. An analysis of directional spillovers reveals that no petroleum commodity dominates other commodities in terms of general spillover transmission.",2014-12-19,
New Evidence on the Financialization of Commodity Markets,This paper uses a novel dataset of commodity-linked notes (CLNs) to examine the impact of the flows of financial investors on commodity futures prices. Investor flows into and out of CLNs are passed to and withdrawn from the futures markets via issuers' trades to hedge their CLN liabilities. The flows are not based on information about futures price movements but nonetheless cause increases and decreases in commodity futures prices when they are passed through to and withdrawn from the futures markets. These finding are consistent with the hypothesis that non-information-based financial investments have important impacts on commodity prices.,2014-12-04,
Determinants of food availability and access in Ghana: what can we learn beyond the regression results?,"Determinants of food availability and access in Ghana: what can we learn beyond the regression results?The study analyses the determinants of food availability and access, and the causes of unsustainable food access in Ghana using three models.Regression results show that the effects of energy price, domestic and foreign interest rates, domestic prices and exchange rate on food availability are negative, while the effects of crop yield, arable land, liberalisation of agricultural trade and real income are positive.The analysis further shows the unique effects of energy price and human capital exceed their common effects.However, the common effects of domestic and foreign interest rates, infl ation, crop yield, arable land, exchange rate, liberalisation of agricultural trade and income exceed their unique effects.The access model shows that the effects of domestic interest rate, exchange rate and oil price are negative.The unique effect of oil price exceeds the variable's common effect.However, the common effects of exchange rate, interest rate and income exceed their unique effects.The stability model shows that good news and higher incomes enhance sustainable food access.However, higher oil price and depreciation of the local currency distort sustainable food access.The policy implication is that government should jointly target variables with higher common effects when addressing food access and availability.Withdrawal of government fuel subsidy will increase consumers' risk of accessing food and hence threaten the sustainability of food access.",2014-12-01,
Financialization of Commodity Markets,"The large inflow of investment capital to commodity futures markets in the past decade has generated a heated debate about whether financialization distorts commodity prices. Rather than focusing on the opposing views concerning whether investment flows caused a price bubble, we critically review academic studies through the perspective of how financial investors affect risk sharing and information discovery in commodity markets. We argue that financialization has substantially changed commodity markets through these mechanisms.",2014-10-23,
Forecasting Stock Returns: Do Commodity Prices Help?,"ABSTRACT This paper examines the relationship between stock prices and commodity prices and whether this can be used to forecast stock returns. As both prices are linked to expected future economic performance they should exhibit a long‐run relationship. Moreover, changes in sentiment towards commodity investing may affect the nature of the response to disequilibrium. Results support cointegration between stock and commodity prices, while Bai–Perron tests identify breaks in the forecast regression. Forecasts are computed using a standard fixed (static) in‐sample/out‐of‐sample approach and by both recursive and rolling regressions, which incorporate the effects of changing forecast parameter values. A range of model specifications and forecast metrics are used. The historical mean model outperforms the forecast models in both the static and recursive approaches. However, in the rolling forecasts, those models that incorporate information from the long‐run stock price/commodity price relationship outperform both the historical mean and other forecast models. Of note, the historical mean still performs relatively well compared to standard forecast models that include the dividend yield and short‐term interest rates but not the stock/commodity price ratio.

Convective Risk Flows in Commodity Futures Markets*,"We study the joint responses of commodity future prices and positions of various trader groups to changes of the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) before and after the recent financial crisis. Financial traders reduced their net long positions during the crisis in response to market distress, whereas hedgers facilitated this by reducing their net short positions as prices fell. This ""convective risk flow"" induced by the greater distress of financial institutions led to a change in the allocation of risk with hedgers holding more risk than they did previously. The presence of such a risk flow confirms the market impact of financial traders conditional on trades they initiate.",2014-10-14,
Strategic Allocation to Commodity Factor Premiums,"In this article the authors confirm the existence of sizable momentum, carry, and low-volatility factor premiums in the commodity market, and argue that investors should consider these commodity factor premiums when determining their strategic asset allocation. They find that a diversified portfolio of commodity factor premiums exhibits a significantly better risk-adjusted performance than the commodity market portfolio and adds significant value to a conventional stock/bond portfolio. The plain commodity market portfolio, on the other hand, appears to deserve little or no role at all in the strategic asset mix. Investors should therefore not postpone the consideration of alternative commodity factor premiums to a later stage of the investment process. <b>TOPICS:</b>Commodities, factor-based models, portfolio construction",2014-09-29,
Strategic commodity allocation,"This article extends the study of the financialization of commodities (Rouwenhorst and Tang [Annu. Rev. Financ. Econ., 2012, 4, 447–467]) by considering an investment in the term structure of commodity futures prices. Specifically, we analyse the benefits of adding a distant commodity futures contract and/or a spot commodity (near month futures contract) to a portfolio of bonds and stocks in a setting similar to Brennan and Schwartz [The use of treasury bill futures in strategic asset allocation programs. In Worldwide Asset and Liability Modeling, edited by W.T. Ziemba and J.M. Mulvey, pp. 205–230, 1998 (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge)]. Our analysis employs an empirical study that covers the post financial crisis period. We show that the spot commodity considerably improves the value of the portfolio. However, an investment in the whole term structure of futures contracts is optimally achieved through high opposite positions in the spot commodity and distant futures contracts. We find that these extreme calendar spreads can result in an inappropriate investment.",2014-09-25,
"Price Explosiveness, Speculation, and Grain Futures Prices","Abstract A recently developed testing procedure is used to detect and date‐stamp explosive episodes (“bubbles”) in corn, soybean, and wheat futures markets during 2004–2013. We find that the markets experienced price explosiveness only approximately two percent of the time and, when bubbles do occur, they are generally short‐lived and small in magnitude. The correspondence between observed price spikes and bubbles is rather low, with a large portion of the price explosiveness occurring during downward price movements. Commodity index trader positions do not significantly affect the probability of a positive bubble occurring in grain futures markets, which directly contradicts the argument (the “Masters Hypothesis”) that waves of index investment distorted underlying supply‐and‐demand relationships and led to a series of massive bubbles in agricultural futures markets. In addition, commodity index trader positions tend to reduce negative bubble occurrence, while general speculative activity as measured by Working's T reduces the probability of a positive bubble. There is some evidence that the positions of noncommercial traders have a direct effect on positive bubble occurrence, but the effect declines when accounting for the composition of other traders in the market. Overall, speculation has little effect or negative effects on price explosiveness. Finally, positive bubbles are more likely to occur in the presence of low inventories, strong exports, a weak U.S. dollar, and booming economic growth, whereas negative bubbles are more likely to occur with large inventories, weak exports, and stagnant economic growth.",2014-08-27,
"Characteristics of Drawdowns, Volatility, and Correlation","This chapter reviews the concepts of drawdown, volatility, and correlation in trend following portfolios. There are several key methods for measuring and understanding drawdowns in trend following portfolios including expected maximum drawdown, drawdown length, and recovery periods. Trend following strategies are divergent risk-taking strategies that spread risk across many markets. Consistent with this approach, scenarios where many markets are losing represents periods when trend following strategies experience drawdowns. It is the number of successful markets and not the magnitude of successes that result in drawdowns. The chapter discusses the impact of correlation on trend following portfolios. During recent times, the market diversification benefit (MDB) measure has been decreasing. This suggests that recently the diversification in trend following portfolios has decreased. A closer examination of Sharpe ratios demonstrates that correlation has an inconclusive relationship with performance.",2014-08-25,
Portfolio selection with commodities under conditional copulas and skew preferences,"This article investigates the portfolio selection problem of an investor with three-moment preferences taking positions in commodity futures. To model the asset returns, we propose a conditional asymmetric t copula with skewed and fat-tailed marginal distributions, such that we can capture the impact on optimal portfolios of time-varying moments, state-dependent correlations, and tail and asymmetric dependence. In the empirical application with oil, gold and equity data from 1990 to 2010, the conditional t copulas portfolios achieve better performance than those based on more conventional strategies. The specification of higher moments in the marginal distributions and the type of tail dependence in the copula has significant implications for the out-of-sample portfolio performance.",2014-08-04,
Common dynamics of nonenergy commodity prices and their relation to uncertainty,"AbstractThe purpose of this article is to improve the empirical evidence on commodity prices in various dimensions. First, we attempt to identify the extent of comovements in 44 monthly nonenergy commodity price series in order to ascertain whether the increase in comovement is a recent term phenomenon. Second, we attempt to determine the role of uncertainty in determining comovements among nonenergy prices in the short run. We diagnose the overall comovement using a dynamic factor model estimated by principal components. A factor-augmented vector autoregressive approach is used to assess the relationship of fundamentals, financial and uncertainty variables with the comovement in commodity prices. We find a greater synchronization among raw materials since December 2003. Since that date, uncertainty has played an important role in determining short-run fluctuations in nonenergy raw material prices.Keywords: commodity pricescomovementfactor-augmented vector autoregressive modelsJEL Classification: E30F00 AcknowledgementsWe thank the participants of the 2013 Annual Meeting of the Association of Southern European Economic Theorists, ASSET and the 6th CSDA International Conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics (CFE 2012), for their useful comments.FundingThe first author acknowledges the financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitively, contract grant ECO2012-32854.

Effect of Byproducts Supplementation by Partically Replacing Soybean Meal to a Total Mixed Ration on Rumen Fermentation Characteristics In Vitro,"본 연구는 농 식품부산물 중 비지박, 사자발약쑥 그리고 커피박의 유효미생물 (L. acidophilus ATCC 496, L. fermentum ATCC 1493, L. plantarum KCTC 1048, L. casei IFO 3533) 발효 사료원이 젖소 급여용 TMR (대조구) 중 대두박을 주로 대체한 각 비지박 (SC), 발효 비지박 (FSC), 발효 비지박+발효 사자발약쑥 부산물 (1:1, DM basis, FSCS) 3, 5, 10% 그리고 발효 비지박 + 발효 커피박 (1:1, DM basis, FSCC) 3, 5, 10%의 반추위 내 미생물 발효특성을 알아보기 위해 9처리구를 이용하여 3반복으로 in vitro 시험이 실시되었다. 배양 6~8시간대에 FSCS와 FSCC 처리구는 SC와 FSC 처리구에 비해 높은 pH 수준을 유지하였고, 대조구에 비해 낮은 pH 수준을 유지하였다 (p<0.05). 또한 배양 24시간대 FSC와 FSCC 3% 처리구는 가장 높은 pH를 유지하였다 (p<0.05). Gas 생성량은 배양 4~10시간대까지 FSCS와 FSCC 처리구가 대조구 보다 유의적으로 높았으나 SC와 FSC 처리구 보다 낮은 결과를 나타내었다 (p<0.05). 건물소화율은 배양 12시간대까지 FSC 처리구에서 유의적으로 높았고 (p<0.05), 24시간대에는 FSCS 10% 처리구가 가장 높은 결과를 나타내었다 (p<0.05). <TEX>$NH_3-N$</TEX> 함량은 배양 4시간대까지 대조구에서 가장 낮았고 (p<0.05), 24시간에서는 FSC 처리구가 가장 높은 결과를 나타내었다 (p<0.05). 미생물단백질 합성량은 배양 시작 시 FSC, FSCS 그리고 FSCC 처리구가 4종의 Lactobacillus spp.에 의한 발효 때문에 대조구와 SC 처리구에 비해 높았으며 (p<0.05), 배양 10시간대 FSC 처리구 보다 SC, FSCS 그리고 FSCC 처리구에서 유의하게 높은 결과를 나타내었다 (p<0.05). Total VFA 농도는 배양 6~12 시간대에는 FSC 처리구에 유의하게 높았고(p<0.05), 배양 24시간대에는 FSCS 처리구에서 가장 높았다 (p<0.05). Acetate 농도는 배양 0~12 시간대에 FSC 처리구에서 가장 높았으며 (p<0.05), 24시간대에는 FSCS 5, 10% 처리구에서 가장 높은 결과를 나타내었다 (p<0.05). Propionate 농도는 FSC 처리구가 배양 0~10시간대까지 가장 높았으며 (p<0.05), 전체 배양기간 동안 FSCS 5, 10% 처리구와 FSCC 처리구에 비해 높은 경향을 나타내었다. Acetate/Propionate 비율은 배양 12시간대에 SC 처리구에서 가장 높았으며, 배양 24시간대에는 FSCS 3% 처리구가 가장 낮은 결과를 나타내었다 (p<0.05). <TEX>$CH_4$</TEX> 가스 생성량은 FSC 처리구에서 배양 0~10시간대까지 가장 높았으며 (p<0.05), 24시간대에는 가장 낮은 결과를 나타내었다 (p<0.05). 배양 4~10시간대까지 FSCS와 FSCC 처리구는 SC와 FSC 처리구에 비해 유의하게 낮은 <TEX>$CH_4$</TEX> 가스 생성량을 나타내었고 (p<0.05), 사자발약쑥과 커피박 함량이 증가할수록 <TEX>$CH_4$</TEX> 가스 생성량은 배양 종료 시까지 낮은 경향을 나타내었다. 따라서, 본 in vitro 시험에서 젖소 급여용 TMR에 SC, FSC, FSCS 그리고 FSCC의 대체효과는 FSC 처리구에서 배양 초기부터 12시간대까지 반추위 내 미생물 발효 특성이 가장 높았다. FSCS와 FSCC 처리구는 배양 6~8시간대 부터 반추위 내 미생물 작용이 높아지는 특징을 나타내었으나, 배양 시작 후 6~8시간대까지 gas 생성량 및 <TEX>$CH_4$</TEX> 가스 발생량은 낮아지는 특징을 나타내었다. 이와 같은 결론은 FSC는 젖소용 TMR 사료원 대체 효과가 높으며, TMR 사료원 중 FSCS와 FSCC 대체효과는 배양 초기 다소 낮은 반추위 내 미생물 발효 특성을 나타내었으나 <TEX>$CH_4$</TEX> 저감효과를 나타내었다. 또한 배양 후기에는 SC와 FSC의 반추위 내 미생물 발효 특성과 비슷한 경향을 나타내어 TMR 사료원으로써 이용 가치가 높을 것으로 사료된다. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of replacing basic total mixed ration (TMR) with fermented soybean curd, Artemisia princeps Pampanini cv. Sajabal, and spent coffee grounds by-product on rumen microbial fermentation in vitro. Soybean in the basic TMR diet (control) was replaced by the following 9 treatments (3 replicates): maximum amounts of soybean curd (SC); fermented SC (FSC); 3, 5, and 10% FSC + fermented A. princeps Pampanini cv. Sajabal (1:1, DM basis, FSCS); and 3, 5, 10% FSC + fermented coffee meal (1:1, DM basis, FSCC) of soybean. FSC, FSCS, and FSCC were fermented using Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 496, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 1493, Lactobacillus plantarum KCTC 1048, and Lactobacillus casei IFO 3533. Replacing dairy cow TMR with FSC treatment led to a pH value of 6 after 8 h of incubation-the lowest value measured (p<0.05), and FSCS and FSCC treatments were higher than SC and FSC treatment after 6 h (p<0.05). Gas production was higher in response to 3% FSC and FSCC treatments than the control after 4-10 h. Dry matter digestibility was increased 0-12 h after FSC treatment (p<0.05) and was the highest after 24 h of 10% FSCS treatment. <TEX>$NH_3-N$</TEX> concentration was the lowest after 24 h of FSC treatment (p<0.05). Microbial protein content increased in response to treatments that had been fermented by the Lactobacillus spp. compared to control and SC treatments (p<0.05). The total concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was increased after 6-12 h of FSC treatment (p<0.05), while the highest acetate proportion was observed 24 h after 5% and 10% FSCS treatments. The FSC of propionate proportion was increased for 0-10 h compared with among treatments (p<0.05). The highest acetate in the propionate ration was observed after 12 h of SC treatment and the lowest with FSCS 3% treatment after 24 h. Methane (<TEX>$CH_4$</TEX>) emulsion was lower with A. princeps Pampanini cv. Sajabal and spent coffee grounds treatments than with the control, SC, and FSC treatments. These experiments were designed to replace the by-products of dairy cow TMR with SC, FSC, FSCS, and FSCC to improve TMR quality. Condensed tannins contained in FSCS and FSCC treatments, which reduced <TEX>$CH_4$</TEX> emulsion in vitro, decreased rumen microbial fermentation during the early incubation time. Therefore, future experiments are required to develop a rumen continuous culture system and an in vivo test to optimize the percentages of FSC, FSCS, and FSCC in the TMR diet of the dairy cows.",2014-06-30,
How does bad and good volatility spill over across petroleum markets? I,"We detect and quantify asymmetries in volatility spillovers using the realized semivariances of petroleum commodities: crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil. During the 1987{2014 period we document increasing spillovers from volatility among petroleum commodities that substantially change after the 2008 nancial crisis. The increase in volatility spillovers correlates with the progressive nancialization of the commodities. In terms of asymmetries in spillovers we show that periods of increasing crude oil prices strongly correlate with dominating spillovers due to bad volatility. Overall, bad volatility due to negative returns spills over among petroleum commodities to a much larger extent than good volatility due to positive returns. After the 2008 nancial crisis the asymmetries in spillovers markedly declined in terms of total as well as directional spillovers. An analysis of directional spillovers further reveals that no commodity dominates other commodities in terms of spillover transmission in general.",2014-05-10,
China's Imported Inflation and Global Commodity Prices,"In this paper, we outline China's imported inflation via global commodity prices. We show that the prices of China's imported commodities are strongly related to global commodity prices. Meanwhile, the final goods prices from upstream industries are strongly influenced by global commodity prices. However, this effect is partially offset by the production process—that is, the final goods prices in downstream industries are generally less affected by global prices. This indicates that China's commodity market has a close link with global commodity markets. Therefore, high global commodity prices generally squeeze profits in China's downstream industries; upstream industries generally benefit from high global commodity prices.",2014-05-01,
A roller coaster ride: an empirical investigation of the main drivers of the international wheat price,"Abstract Over the last decade, commodity prices have registered substantial booms and busts marked by extreme volatility. Wheat in particular, one of the main nonoil commodities, has registered a roller coaster in price levels which seems to be inconsistent with supply and demand fundamentals. To acutely investigate the drivers of wheat prices and quantify their impact, a vector error correction model (VECM) has been used. The exogenous variables have been distinguished into four groups: market‐specific factors, broad macroeconomic determinants, speculative components, and weather variables. The quadriangulation of the determinants will enable us to better understand the movements in wheat price and identify the specific role of each component. The results show that a mix of factors are contributing to wheat price movements, including speculation, global demand, and real effective exchange rate.",2014-04-23,

The Role of Index Trading in Price Formation in the Grains and Oilseeds Markets,"Abstract We use both Granger‐causality and instrumental variables ( IV ) methods to examine the impact of index fund positions on price returns for the main US grains and oilseed futures markets. Our analysis supports earlier conclusions that Granger‐causal impacts are generally not discernible. However, market microstructure theory suggests trading impacts should be instantaneous. IV ‐based tests for contemporaneous causality provide stronger evidence of price impact. We find even stronger evidence that changes in index positions can help predict future changes in aggregate commodity price indices. This result suggests that changes in index investment are in part driven by information which predicts commodity price changes over the coming months.",2014-04-09,
Hedging Industrial Metals With Stochastic Volatility Models,"The financialization of commodities documented in [Tang and Xiong (2012) Financial Analyst Journal , 68:54–74] has led commodity prices to exhibit not only time‐varying volatility, but also price and volatility jumps. Using the class of stochastic volatility (SV) models, we incorporate such extreme price movements to generate out‐of‐sample hedge ratios. In‐sample estimation on China's copper (CU) and aluminum (AL) spot and futures markets confirms the presence of price jumps and price‐volatility jump correlations. Out‐of‐sample hedge ratios from the [Bates (1996) Review of Financial Studies , 9:69–107] SV with price jumps model deliver the greatest risk reduction on the unhedged positions at 59.55% for CU and 49.85% for AL. But it is the [Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000) Econometrica , 68:1343–1376] SV model with correlated price and volatility jumps that produces hedge ratios which yield the largest Sharpe Ratios of 0.644 for CU and 0.886 for AL. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hernandezhttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-6845SectionsAboutPDF (1.4 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the degree of co-movement among the nominal price returns of 11 major energy, agricultural and food commodities based on monthly data between 1970 and 2013. A uniform-spacings testing approach, a multivariate dynamic conditional correlation model and a rolling regression procedure are used to study the extent and the time-evolution of unconditional and conditional correlations. The results indicate that (i) the price returns of energy and agricultural commodities are highly correlated; (ii) the overall level of co-movement among commodities increased in recent years, especially between energy and agricultural commodities and in particular in the cases of maize and soybean oil, which are important inputs in the production of biofuels; and (iii) particularly after 2007, stock market volatility is positively associated with the co-movement of price returns across markets.

Macroeconomic uncertainty: does it matter for commodity prices?,"Using a new uncertainty index from Baker et al. (2013), we evaluate the time-varying correlation between macroeconomic uncertainty and commodity prices. Estimation results from a multivariate DCC-GARCH model reveal that increased volatility in uncertainty leads to increased price and volatility in commodity markets, while increased volatility in commodity markets enhances policy uncertainty. Our results also indicate that the dynamic linkage between uncertainty and commodity prices varies over time substantially. It becomes more correlated since the later part of 2003, and behaves largely different before and after the 2008 financial crisis.",2014-03-31,
The interaction of speculators and index investors in agricultural derivatives markets,"Abstract Through the analysis of the weekly Commodity Futures Trading Commission reports on 12 US traded agricultural commodities, we revisit the heated debate on the impact of index flows on commodities prices. After introducing a novel stock‐to‐use proxy that may be used to represent inventory variations at the intra‐month level, we show that speculators, contrary to index investors, are sensitive to commodity‐specific fundamental information. Their endogeneity to commodities markets hinders the estimation of their market impact. Regarding the market impact of index flows, the endogeneity problem is alleviated in two ways: first, we restrict the scope to agricultural commodities, for which index flows are more exogenous to market prices; second, we introduce two novel instrumental variables that are computed from index flows outside the market under analysis. We find that index investment flows are offset by commercial players, not speculators. The serial correlation of index flows may explain the tendency of speculators to synchronize with index investors. There is strong evidence of an index flows' impact in those commodities markets where speculative and index positions are the most correlated. The market impact of index flows is located in periods of liquidity stress, as is the correlation between speculative and index positions. Overall, our results demonstrate an impact of index investors on some agricultural prices and suggest that the synchronicity between speculative and index positions is an important determinant of this impact.",2014-03-28,
Speculation in the Oil Market,"The run-up in oil prices since 2004 coincided with growing investment in commodity markets and increased price co-movement among different commodities. We assess whether speculation in the oil market played a role in driving this salient empirical pattern. We identify oil shocks from a large dataset using a dynamic factor model. This method is motivated by the fact that a small-scale vector autoregression is not informationally sufficient to identify the shocks. The main results are as follows. (i) While global demand shocks account for the largest share of oil price fluctuations, speculative shocks are the second most important driver. (ii) The increase in oil prices over the last decade is mainly driven by the strength of global demand. However, speculation played a significant role in the oil price increase between 2004 and 2008 and its subsequent collapse. (iii) The co-movement between oil prices and the prices of other commodities is mainly explained by global demand shocks. Our results support the view that the recent oil price increase is mainly driven by the strength of global demand but that the financialization process of commodity markets also played a role.

Have food and financial markets integrated?,"This article analyses comovements and discusses possibly greater market integration between aggregate food commodity and stock prices in the period 1990 to 2012. Return correlations, price return distributions, cointegration and Granger-causalities are tested in subsamples on monthly FAO Food Price Index and MSCI World Stock Market Index. Empirical results suggest that while there is only weak indication of greater comovements concurrent with structural changes such as changed agricultural policies, new demand due to growth in emerging markets and energy mandates and the financialization of food markets since the early 2000s, they did start to increase substantially in particular during the financial stress of the Lehman crisis and the Great Recession. While structural changes may have amplified price linkages across markets, results do not suggest that they are the key factors for greater price comovements. Instead, the effects of the late-2000s recession as a time of great economic weakness and uncertainty may have changed concurrently the behaviour of both food and financial market participants, such that different market prices exhibit large comovements.",2014-03-14,
"World Food System Disruptions in the Early 2000s: Causes, Impacts, and Cures","The rapidly rising and more‐volatile food prices of recent years are a significant indication of changes in global markets and a signal of resource scarcity. They pose new challenges in terms of food and nutrition security at the worldwide level. This article traces the main drivers and impacts of food price increases, and proposes institutional changes in the world food system to help overcome chronic supply constraints through enhanced productivity, combined with actions to address new causes of food price volatility, such as financialization of commodity markets and linkages to energy markets. The price crises of 2008 and 2011, and to a lesser extent in 2012, have been met with often, uncoordinated national policy adjustments with international implications. To prevent such collective actions failures in the international food system, comprehensive institutional changes are proposed.",2014-03-01,
Time-varying co-movements between stock market returns and oil price shocks,"This paper investigates the time-varying co-movements between stock market returns and oil price shocks, for both oil-importing and oil-exporting countries. To achieve this, we use data from 1998 until 2013 and employ a Scalar-BEKK model. Our findings are as follows: (i) the correlation between oil price shocks and index returns are showing some differences depending on whether a country is oil-importer or oil-exporter, (ii) the correlations are industry-specific and shock-specific, (iii) the aggregate demand shocks generate moderate positive correlations with stock market returns until 2011, (iv) stock market index returns have low to zero correlation with the supply-side shocks and (v) oil specific demand shocks have a moderate positive correlation with all indices in the post-2006 period. Our results have important implication for investor, as well as, policy makers.",2014-03-01,
"Network effects, cascades and CCP interoperability","To control counterparty risk, financial regulations such as the Dodd Frank Act are increasingly requiring standardized derivatives trades to be cleared by central counterparties (CCPs). It is anticipated that in the near-term future, CCPs across the world will be linked through interoperability agreements that facilitate risk-sharing but also serve as a conduit for transmitting shocks. This paper theoretically studies a network with CCPs that are linked through interoperability arrangements, and studies the properties of the network that contribute to cascading failures. The magnitude of the cascading is theoretically related to the strength of network linkages, the size of the network, the logistic mapping coefficient, a stochastic effect and CCP's defense lines. Simulations indicate that larger network effects increase systemic risk from cascading failures. The size of the network N raises the threshold value of shock sizes that are required to generate cascades. Hence, the larger the network, the more robust it will be.",2014-02-10,
Effects of Index-Fund Investing on Commodity Futures Prices,"The last decade brought substantial increased participation in commodity markets by index funds that maintain long positions in the near futures contracts.Policy makers and academic studies have reached sharply different conclusions about the effects of these funds on commodity futures prices.This paper proposes a unifying framework for examining this question, noting that according to a simple model of futures arbitrage, if index-fund buying influences prices by changing the risk premium, then the notional positions of the index investors should help predict excess returns in these contracts.We find no evidence that the positions of traders in agricultural contracts identified by the CFTC as following an index strategy can help predict returns on the near futures contracts.We review evidence that these positions might help predict changes in oil futures prices, and find that while there is some support for this in the earlier data, this appears to be driven by some of the dramatic features of the 2007-2009 recession, with the relation breaking down out of sample.",2014-02-01,
"Deconstructing Wheat Price Spikes: A Model of Supply and Demand, Financial Speculation, and Commodity Price Comovement","In 2008, wheat futures prices spiked and then crashed along with prices for other agricultural and nonagricultural commodities. Market observers offered several theories to explain this common movement, or comovement, in prices, and have proposed policies to address the perceived problem of excessive price volatility. The design of an appropriate policy response would benefit from a better understanding of the cause of the observed price movements. This study uses an econometric model to decompose observed wheat prices into a set of economic factors and measure the relative contribution of each factor to observed price changes. Findings show that market-specific shocks related to supply and demand for wheat were the dominant cause of price spikes in the three U.S. wheat futures markets. Fluctuations in the global macroeconomy associated with broadbased demand shocks were relatively less significant for wheat than for other commodities like crude oil and corn. Finally, little evidence suggests commodity index trading contributed to recent price spikes.",2014-01-01,
Risk Adjusted Time Series Momentum,"We introduce a new class of momentum strategies, the risk-adjusted time series momentum (RAMOM) strategies, which are based on averages of past futures returns, normalized by their volatility. We test these strategies on a universe of 64 liquid futures contracts and show that RAMOM strategies outperform the time series momentum (TSMOM) strategies of Ooi, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2012) for almost all combinations of holding and look-back periods. This outperformance is driven by the following new striking stylized fact that we document: For almost all of the 64 futures contracts, independent of the asset class, realized futures volatility is contemporaneously negatively related to the Fama and French (1987) market (MKT), value (HML), and momentum (UMD) factors. As a result, RAMOM returns have a natural, built-in exposure to the MKT, HML, and UMD factors and outperform TSMOM returns precisely in times when (some of) the factors deliver good returns. In particular, RAMOM allows investors to gain significant exposure to Fama and French factors without actually trading the very large stock universe. Furthermore, dollar turnover of RAMOM strategies is about 40% lower than that of TSMOM, implying a drastic reduction in trading costs.",2014-01-01,
Production-Based Asset Pricing and the Oil Market,"What is the role of macroeconomic fluctuations and of oil supply shocks for oil prices, volatilities, and risk premia? I analyze this question within a general equilibrium asset pricing framework with an oil sector. The benchmark calibration shows that short-run macroeconomic growth shocks and oil productivity shocks account for the largest part of the volatility in the oil market and are responsible for the mean-reversion behavior of oil prices. On the other hand, long-run macroeconomic growth risks are the main driver of risk premia on oil futures and their upward-sloping term structure, which is observed in the data. The model consistently explains quantity and price dynamics in the oil sector and in the general macroeconomy, and furthermore sheds light on the intricate relationship between oil and equity returns.",2014-01-01,
Strategies Based on Momentum and Term Structure in Financialized Commodity Markets,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of the financialization of commodity markets on the profitability of strategies based on momentum and term structure. The performance of an array of portfolios from double-sorts on non-commercial traders’ participation, historical returns and term spreads are tested against a risk model. The analysis covers the listing of 26 commodities in the period 1986–2013. First and foremost, the paper provides a fresh evidence for the validity of strategies based on momentum and term structure investing in commodity markets. Secondly, it proves that term structure strategies generate significantly higher performance results in non-financialized markets. Moreover, it supports the thesis that market financialization adversely affects momentum profits. The results are important in terms of tactical and strategic asset allocation in commodity markets. They imply that investors who implement momentum or term structure based strategies should also consider the composition of market participants.",2014-01-01,
Forecasting Stock Returns: Do Commodity Prices Help?,"This paper examines the relationship between stock prices and commodity prices and whether this can be used to forecast stock returns. As both prices are linked to expected future economic performance they should exhibit a long-run relationship. Moreover, changes in sentiment towards commodity investing may affect the nature of the response to disequilibrium. Results support cointegration between stock and commodity prices, while Bai-Perron tests identify breaks in the predictive regression. Forecasts are computed using a standard fixed (static) in-sample/out-of-sample approach and by rolling regressions, which incorporates the effect of changing forecast parameter values. A range of model specifications and forecast metrics are used. The historical mean model outperforms the forecast models in the static approach. However, in the rolling forecasts, those models that incorporate information from the long-run stock price/commodity price relationship outperform both the historical mean and other forecast models. Of note, the historical mean still performs relatively well compared to standard forecast models that include the dividend yield and short term interest rates but not the stock/commodity price ratio.",2014-01-01,

Indeed, climate change mitigation and energy security have been frequent rationales behind biofuel policies, but biofuels production could generate negative impacts, such as additional demand for feedstocks, and therefore for land on which to grow them, with a consequent increase in food commodity price. In this context, this paper examines the effect of biofuels and other economic and financial factors on daily returns of a group of commodity futures prices using Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) family models in univariate and multivariate settings. The results show that a complex of drivers are relevant in explaining commodity futures returns; more precisely, the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 positively affects commodity markets, while the US/Euro exchange rate brings about a decline in commodity returns. It turns out, in addition, that energy market returns are significant in explaining commodity returns on a daily basis, while monetary liquidity does not. Finally, the GARCH model has shown that current variance is influenced more by its past values than by the previous day’s shocks, and there is high persistence, meaning that variance slowly decays and prompts a sluggish ""revert to the mean."" The multivariate BEKK framework confirms the results of the univariate setting.",2014-01-01,
Booms and Busts in Commodity Markets: Bubbles or Fundamentals?,"This paper considers whether there were periodically collapsing rational speculative bubbles in commodity prices over a forty year period from the late 1960s. We apply a switching regression approach to a broad range of commodities using two different measures of fundamental values – estimated from convenience yields and from a set of macroeconomic factors believed to affect commodity demand. We find reliable evidence for bubbles only among crude oil and feeder cattle, showing the popular belief that the extreme price movements observed in commodity markets were caused by pure speculation to be unsustainable.",2014-01-01,
Macroeconomic Determinants of Commodity Returns in Financialized Markets,"Financialization of commodity markets has been a broadly discussed topic in recent years. However, its implications for commodity investors have not yet been fully explored. This paper concentrates on the macroeconomic determinants of commodity returns in financialized and non-financialized markets and on their role for tactical asset allocation. The study aims to contribute to the academic literature in four ways. First, it provides fresh evidence on the interdependences between commodity returns, inflation and the business activity. Second, it documents increased correlation of the commodity returns with the business activity in the financialized markets. Third, it explores changes in the lead/lag relationship of commodity prices and the business cycle. Fourth, it proves that the commodities retained their inflation hedging abilities in the financialized markets. The computations are based on listings of various commodity indices, which are calculated by S&P-GSCI, JP Morgan, and Dow Jones-UBS, between 1970 and 2013.",2014-01-01,
Cross-Market Spillovers with Volatility Surprisee,"This article adopts the asymmetric DCC with one exogenous variable (ADCCX) model developed by Vargas (2008), by updating the concept of 'volatility surprise' to capture cross-market relationships. Current methods for measuring spillovers do not focus on volatility interactions, and neglect cross-effects between the conditional variances. This paper aims to fill this gap. The dataset includes four aggregate indices representing equities, bonds, foreign exchange rates and commodities from 1983 to 2013. The results provide strong evidence of spillover effects coming from the 'volatility surprise' component across markets. Against the background of the recent financial crisis, the aim is to contribute to the literature on the interdependencies of financial markets, both in conditional means and (co)variances. In addition, asset management implications are derived.",2014-01-01,
How Does Bad and Good Volatility Spill Over Across Petroleum Markets?,"We detect and quantify asymmetries in volatility spillovers using the realized semivariances of petroleum commodities: crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil. During the 1987-2014 period we document increasing spillovers from volatility among petroleum commodities that substantially change after the 2008 financial crisis. The increase in volatility spillovers correlates with the progressive financialization of the commodities. In terms of asymmetries in spillovers we show that periods of increasing crude oil prices strongly correlate with dominating spillovers due to bad volatility. Overall, bad volatility due to negative returns spills over among petroleum commodities to a much larger extent than good volatility due to positive returns. After the 2008 financial crisis the asymmetries in spillovers markedly declined in terms of total as well as directional spillovers. An analysis of directional spillovers further reveals that no commodity dominates other commodities in terms of spillover transmission in general.",2014-01-01,
Rising and Volatile Food Prices: Are Index Fund Investors to Blame?,"The recent sharp increase in the prices of primary food commodities has raised serious concerns of policy makers on the role of index funds in these food markets. In this paper, we employ a dataset on trading positions of index fund investors from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and analyze the relationship between index fund activity and food prices and their volatility. We focus on three major and liquid agricultural markets: corn, soybeans and wheat. We find little evidence that the positions of index fund investors can help explain changes in food prices. Instead, causality from food price changes to position changes appears to be much stronger. Furthermore, our findings suggest that index trader positions bear some predictive ability for volatility. This relationship is mainly concentrated on the 2006-2009 period that includes the recent financial crisis. Finally, we find that volatility decreases with the positions of index fund traders.",2014-01-01,
Equity Portfolio Management Using Option Price Information,"We survey the recent academic literature that uses option-implied information to construct equity portfolios. Studies show that equity managers can earn a positive alpha by using information in individual equity options, by using stocks' exposure to information in market index options, and by using stocks' exposure to crude oil option information. Option-implied information can also help construct better mean-variance portfolios and better estimates of market beta.",2014-01-01,
Equivalent Volume and Comovement,"We introduce a new indicator of relative liquidity, equivalent volume (EV), based on the amount of a stock traded indirectly through its inclusion in ETFs. We hypothesize that the EV of an ETF component stock is related to its comovement with other component stocks through the relative liquidity channel under trading caused by arbitrage. Using daily ETF holdings and several comovement estimators, we find that a one unit increase in daily equivalent volume is associated with increase in comovement ranging from 1.1% to 27.6%. Our findings contribute to the literature on trading volume, liquidity and comovement by relating arbitrage-induced trading pressure to the underlying stock comovement.",2014-01-01,
The Impact of Financialization on the Benefits of Incorporating Commodity Futures in Actively Managed Portfolios,"This paper examines the return performance and diversification benefits of both buy-and-hold and tactical portfolios of commodity futures. We fuse together both of these highly desired investment benefits of the unique asset class to provide a thorough analysis of the commodities market given the changes it has undergone over the last decade due to the rapid increase in investor participation. We find that tactical portfolios based on basis and net speculation offer the highest potential returns. However, in the post-2000 era, the risk-adjusted returns of many of the commodity portfolio examined are insignificant. Furthermore, we find the diversification properties of these commodity portfolios have largely broken down for investors of traditional buy-and-hold benchmark portfolios, and to a lesser extent actively managed equity-based benchmark portfolios, since the early 2000’s. This breakdown has been much less severe for the international buy-and-hold portfolios when compared to the US domestic buy-and-hold counterpart.",2014-01-01,
Co-Movement of Major Commodity Price Returns: A Time-Series Assessment,"This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the degree of co-movement among the nominal price returns of 11 major energy, agricultural, and food commodities using monthly data between 1970 and 2013. The authors study the extent and the time evolution of unconditional and conditional correlations using a uniform-spacings testing approach, a multivariate dynamic conditional correlation model and a rolling regression procedure. The authors find that (1) the price returns of energy and agricultural commodities are highly correlated; (2) the overall level of co-movement among commodities increases in recent years, especially between energy and agricultural commodities and in particular in the cases of maize and soybean oil, which are important inputs in the production of biofuels and (3) stock market volatility is positively associated with the co-movement of price returns across markets, especially since 2007.",2014-01-01,
Systemic Risk in Commodity Markets: What Do Trees Tell Us About Crises?,"We examine the impact of two financial crises on commodity derivative markets: the subprime crisis and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. These crises are ""ex- ternal"" to the commodity markets because they occurred in the financial sphere. Still, because commodity markets are now highly integrated with each other and with other financial markets, such events could have had an impact. In order to fully comprehend this possible impact, we rely on tools inspired by the graph theory that allow for the study of large databases. We examine the daily price fluctuations recorded in 14 derivative markets from 2000 to 2009 in three dimensions: the ob- servation time, the space dimension – the same underlying asset can be traded simultaneously in two different places – and the maturity of the transactions. We perform an event study in which we first focus on the efficiency of the price shock’s transmission to the commodity markets during the crises. Then we concentrate on whether the paths of shock transmission are modified. Finally, relying on the measure proposed by Bonacich (1987) for social networks, we focus on whether the centrality of the price system changes.",2014-01-01,
Risks and Risk Premiums in Commodity Markets,"This PhD thesis investigates risks and risk premiums in commodities markets. Two chapters discuss the risks premium in interconnected electricity markets. One chapter develops a model for price spikes, and the risks of extreme outcomes for spot electricity prices. The last chapter investigates convenience yield risk premiums in various commodity markets. The research follows the thesis by publication format and has four completed research papers. The first paper provides an empirical analysis of the relationship between spot and futures prices in interconnected regional Australian electricity markets. We find positive and significant risk premiums for several of the considered regions. Using a general equilibrium model and applying a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) approach, we also find that price levels, as well as skewness and kurtosis of spot prices are determinants of the realized risk premiums in these markets. The second paper investigates the dynamics of futures premiums in Australian electricity markets. We examine how premiums behave depending on the time-to-delivery of the considered contracts as well as for different delivery periods. We find that futures premiums tend to increase when: (i) the time is closer to maturity of the contract, (ii) spot price is high, and (iii) the number of price spikes increases. The third paper examines the impact of explanatory variables such as load, weather and capacity constraints, on the occurrence and magnitude of price spikes in Australian electricity markets. Applying the Heckman correction model, we find that the market load, relative air temperature and reserve margins are significant variables for the occurrence of price spikes. Electricity loads and relative air temperature are also significant variables impacting on the magnitude of a price spike. The Heckman selection model also outperforms a standard OLS regression approach. The fourth paper presents a comprehensive examination of convenience yield risk premiums in various commodity markets. Constructing a security that is only sensitive to convenience yield risk, we find that convenience yield risk premiums are positive and, that risk premiums are very large for metals and grains while there are no significant convenience yield risk premiums for oil and gas.",2014-01-01,
Financialization in Commodity Markets: Disentangling the Crisis from the Style Effect,"In this paper, we show that large inflows into commodity investments, a recent phenomenon known as financialization, has changed the behavior and dependence structure between commodities and the general stock market. The common perception is that the increase in comovements is the result of distressed investors selling both assets during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. We show that financial distress alone cannot explain the size and persistence of comovements. Instead, we argue that commodities have become an investment style for institutional investors. Given that institutional investors continue to target funds into commodities, we predict spillovers between commodities and the stock market to remain high in the future.",2014-01-01,
Increasing Trends in the Excess Comovement of Commodity Prices,"In this paper, we investigate whether and how excess comovement among commodity returns i.e., correlation among commodity returns not accounted for by the common shocks of exogenous macroeconomic variables, have increased during these decades.",2014-01-01,
The Impact of Market Participantss Interaction on Futures Prices: Comparing Three U.S. Wheat Futures Markets,Many trends in the world wheat market might explain the extreme price movements on the U.S. wheat futures markets in 2007/08 and 2010. But the different price reactions on the three wheat futures markets raise doubt if only supply and demand moved wheat future prices. The question arises if the activity of different market participants is also essential for price discovery.,2014-01-01,
Are Commodity Futures Prices Barometers of the Global Economy?,"This paper analyzes whether commodity futures prices traded in the United States reveal information relevant to stock prices of East Asian economies including China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan.We find significant and positive predictive powers of overnight futures returns of copper and soybeans, albeit not crude oil, for stock prices of all these East Asian economies and across a broad range of industries after mid-2000s.Our analysis establishes commodity futures prices as barometers of global economic strength in recent years, but leaves open a deeper issue regarding whether through this informational channel noise from futures market trading can feed back to the real economy.",2013-12-01,
The Financialization of Commodity Markets,"The large inflow of investment capital to commodity futures markets in the last decade has generated a heated debate about whether financialization distorts commodity prices.Rather than focusing on the opposing views concerning whether investment flows either did or did not cause a price bubble, we critically review academic studies through the perspective of how financial investors affect risk sharing and information discovery in commodity markets.We argue that financialization has substantially changed commodity markets through these mechanisms.",2013-11-01,
Drivers and triggers of international food price spikes and volatility,"The objective of this study is to explore empirical evidence on the quantitative importance of supply, demand, and market shocks for price changes in international food commodity markets. To this end, it distinguishes between root, conditional, and internal drivers of price changes using three empirical models: (1) a price spike model where monthly food price returns (spikes) are estimated against oil prices, supply and demand shocks, and excessive speculative activity; (2) a volatility model where annualized monthly variability of food prices is estimated against the same set of variables plus a financial crises index; and (3) a trigger model that estimates extreme values of price spikes and volatility using quantile regressions. The results point to the increasing linkages among food, energy, and financial markets, which explain much of the observed food price spikes and volatility. While financial speculation amplifies short-term price spikes, oil price volatility intensifies medium-term price volatility.",2013-10-05,
A Conditional Assessment of the RelationshipsBetween Commodity and Equity Indexes,"This study models the conditional relationships between the Goldman Sachs Total Return Commodity Index and Sub-Indexes and the S&amp;P 500 index from January 1991 through June 2011 within a bivariate GARCH framework that uses instruments to model time-varying conditional correlations. The results indicate the presence of important spillovers between the conditional means and volatilities of commodity and equity index returns. The findings also indicate that conditional correlations increase from roughly zero to about 0.4 during the sample period, consistent with an increased integration of commodity and equity markets. The results also indicate that conditional correlations rise when the conditional volatility of equity returns increases and when business cycle conditions deteriorate. The greater integration of these markets is also reflected in the increase of conditional betas from around zero to roughly 0.6 over the sample period. Overall, the results indicate that while the diversification benefits of commodities diminished over the sample period, the estimated conditional correlations remain low enough for commodities to provide meaningful diversification benefits to equity investors. <b>TOPICS:</b>Commodities, security analysis and valuation, mutual funds/passive investing/indexing, statistical methods",2013-09-27,
Globally Distributed Production and the Pricing of CME Commodity Futures,"Abstract I investigate how local supply shocks in the globally distributed production of commodities are incorporated into Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures prices. I exploit that the soybean market share of the United States (Argentina) decreased (increased) between 1996 and 2010, and use rain, which tends to increase output, as a source of exogenous supply shocks. I find a significantly negative response of CME soybean prices to daily rain across regions and time. Moreover, the impact of local rain on the CME price is approximately linear in the time‐varying local share of global output. Therefore, traders of CME contracts seem to aggregate supply in a globally integrated manner and are exposed to globally distributed shocks. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Pattern of Price Linkages Among Commodities,"Abstract We investigate the linkages between commodity futures prices to determine whether the price patterns have changed during time periods with major changes in the markets. Examining data from 1990 through 2011 we search for changing patterns in correlation coefficients, (non)stationarity, and cointegration among a set of commodities with widely traded futures markets. We find that simple correlation coefficients between futures prices and the probability of nonstationarity of the series have increased over time. However, our cointegration test results show no evidence for an increase in cointegration. This mixed evidence suggests that futures markets have become more efficient over time, but that previously unrelated commodities have not seen equilibrium relationships established. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Asset Prices and Institutional Investors,"We consider an economy populated by institutional investors alongside standard retail investors. Institutions care about their performance relative to a certain index. Our framework is tractable, admitting exact closed-form expressions, and produces the following analytical results. We find that institutions tilt their portfolios towards stocks that compose their benchmark index. The resulting price pressure boosts index stocks. By demanding more risky stocks than retail investors, institutions amplify the index stock volatilities and aggregate stock market volatility and give rise to countercyclical Sharpe ratios. Trades by institutions induce excess correlations among stocks that belong to their benchmark, generating an asset-class effect. (JEL G12, G23)",2013-08-01,
Noisy Inventory Announcements and Energy Prices,"Abstract This study examines the effect of oil and gas inventory announcements on energy prices. Previous estimates of this effect suffer from bias due to measurement error in inventory surprises. We utilize intraday futures data for three petroleum commodities and natural gas to estimate the price response coefficients using traditional event study regressions and the identification‐through‐censoring (ITC) technique proposed by Rigobon and Sack [Rigobon and Sack (2008). Asset prices and monetary policy (pp. 335–370). Chicago: University of Chicago Press]. The results show that the bias in OLS estimates of the price impact of inventory surprises is quite large. The ITC coefficient estimates are about twice as large as OLS estimates for petroleum commodities and about four times as large as OLS estimates for natural gas. These results imply that energy prices are more strongly influenced by unexpected changes in inventory than shown in previous research. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Role of Speculation in Oil Markets: What Have We Learned So Far?,"A popular view is that the surge in the real price of oil during 2003-08 cannot be explained by economic fundamentals, but was caused by the increased financialization of oil futures markets, which in turn allowed speculation to become a major determinant of the spot price of oil. This interpretation has been driving policy efforts to tighten the regulation of oil derivatives markets. This survey reviews the evidence supporting this view. We identify six strands in the literature and discuss to what extent each sheds light on the role of speculation. We find that the existing evidence is not supportive of an important role of speculation in driving the spot price of oil after 2003. Instead, there is strong evidence that the co-movement between spot and futures prices reflects common economic fundamentals rather than the financialization of oil futures markets.",2013-07-01,
Commodity and Asset Pricing Models: An Integration,"We present a simple methodology that integrates commodity and asset pricing models.Given current evidence on the financialization of commodity markets, valuable information about commodity risk premiums can be extracted from asset pricing models and used to substantially improve the estimates of expected spot prices provided by current commodity price models.The methodology can be used with any pair of commodity and asset pricing models.An implementation of the methodology is presented using the Schwartz and Smith (2000) two-factor commodity price model and the CAPM.Reasonable expected spot prices are obtained without negative consequences in the model's fit to futures prices.",2013-06-01,
Tail events: A new approach to understanding extreme energy commodity prices,"This paper shows that extreme energy price changes, located in the 10% tails of the distribution, cluster across energy commodity markets during the boom-bust cycle of 2006 to 2012. Using multinominal logit regressions, I find that the coincidence of such tail events cannot be explained solely by common supply and demand fundamentals. Instead, I provide evidence that the transmission of extreme price changes occurs through a financial demand channel. Specifically, changes in the net long position of hedge funds are associated with a significant increase in the probability of coincident large positive and negative returns across energy markets. Evidence that index investments drive tail events is limited. Further, I identify adverse shocks to speculator funding liquidity as determinant of synchronized price drops across energy markets. The likelihood of extreme negative returns in more than one market significantly increases when the TED spread rises.",2013-05-01,
Advances in the Commodity Futures Literature: <i>A Review</i>,"Investors seeking yield in difficult market conditions are increasingly considering ""alternative"" asset classes. These include commodities, which are mostly accessed through commodity futures. In this article, Skiadopoulos examines the evidence in the finance literature regarding three major issues that arise in treating commodity futures as investment assets. The first question is how much diversification benefit is gained through commodity futures? Much of the reported evidence suffers from methodological problems, such as failure to examine out-of-sample performance or to take account of the transactions costs imposed by the frequent rollover of expiring futures contracts. A second question is to what extent our familiar factor models for equities can be applied to commodity returns. The answer so far is that finding dependable common factors is not easy. Third, given the regulatory changes underway in Washington and elsewhere, he considers the evidence on how margins and margin changes affect futures markets. Overall, the article raises important questions about the use of commodity futures as an asset class in traditional investment portfolios, and shows that the answers available in the literature are less supportive than one might have liked. <b>TOPICS:</b>Futures and forward contracts, commodities, portfolio construction",2013-02-28,
Exogenous Shocks and Information Transmission in Global Copper Futures Markets,"Abstract Bivariate EGARCH models are used to investigate mean and volatility spillovers across major global copper futures markets before and after the Global Financial Crisis. We show that the overall magnitude and significance of information spillovers strengthen after the crisis. The exogenous shocks not only exhibit considerable information spillovers on copper futures markets but also enhance information transmission among them, including bi‐directional mean and volatility spillovers and long‐run equilibrium. Moreover, our results shed light on the growing importance of the Shanghai Copper futures market in information transmission.",2013-02-25,
"Financial Crises, Financialization of Commodity Markets and Correlation of Agricultural Commodity Index with Precious Metal Index and S&P500","This paper tests and models time varying correlations among agricultural commodity, precious metal and S&P500 indices to uncover whether rising trend among these markets is a result of financialization of commodity markets and/or financial crisis. We particularly investigate the roles of market news, global and market volatility on the nature and dynamics of the correlation. Empirical results show that high volatility during financial crisis is the main source of high correlation of agricultural commodity index with S&P500 and precious metal index, and plays crucial role in correlation between precious metal index and S&P500, possibly due to increasing engagement of financial market investors in commodity markets during financial crisis. Hence, heterogeneous structure of commodity markets delivers better portfolio diversification opportunities during calm periods compared to turmoil periods of financial crisis.",2013-02-01,

A Model of Financialization of Commodities,"A sharp increase in the popularity of commodity investing in the past decade has triggered an unprecedented inflow of institutional funds into commodity futures markets, referred to as the financialization of commodities. In this paper, we explore the effects of financialization in a model that features institutional investors alongside traditional futures markets participants. The institutional investors care about their performance relative to a commodity index. We find that in the presence of institutional investors prices and volatilities of all commodity futures go up, but more so for the index futures than for nonindex ones. The correlations amongst commodity futures as well as in equity-commodity correlations also increase, with higher increases for index commodities. Within a framework additionally incorporating storage, we show how financial markets transmit shocks not only to futures prices but also to commodity spot prices and inventories. Commodity spot prices and inventories go up with financialization. In the presence of institutional investors shocks to any index commodity spill over to all storable commodity prices.",2013-01-01,

Commodity Variance Risk Premia and Expected Futures Returns: Evidence from the Crude Oil Market,"We develop an extended mean-variance model to investigate the relationship between variance risk premia (VRP) and expected futures returns in the commodity market. In the presence of stochastic variance, commodity producers trade both futures and options to hedge their exposure to commodity price and volatility risk; speculators provide liquidity and ask for risk premia. This model reveals a negative relationship between VRP and expected futures returns. Empirically, we measure VRP using options and high-frequency futures data in the crude oil market. Consistent with our model, we find that VRP negatively predict futures returns even after controlling for other predictor variables.",2013-01-01,
Exchange-Traded Funds on Gold - A Free Lunch?,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on indices provide access to a diversified portfolio of assets at a low cost. Whilst ETFs on single commodities have less obvious advantages its number has grown substantially in recent years. This paper analyzes the benefits and risks of single-asset ETFs theoretically and empirically using more than 80 physical and synthetic gold ETFs. We show that ETFs on gold provide a low cost and more liquid alternative to physical investments in gold. As a consequence, the introduction of ETFs on gold leads to a structural demand shift with implications for the price of gold, the volume traded and the volatility of gold. Our analysis provides new evidence on the financialization of commodities and can help to explain the growth of gold ETFs and changes in the price of gold.",2013-01-01,
Reference Dependent Preferences and the EPK Puzzle,"Supported by several recent investigations, the empirical pricing kernel (EPK) puzzle might be considered a stylized fact.

"Monetary Policy Surprises, Positions of Traders, and Changes in Commodity Futures Prices","Using futures data for the period 1990–2008, this paper finds evidence that expansionary monetary policy surprises tend to increase crude and heating oil prices, and contractionary monetary policy shocks increase gold and platinum prices. Our analysis uncovers substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of this response to positive and negative surprises across different commodities and commodity groups. The results also suggest that the positions of futures traders for the metals and energy commodities strongly respond to monetary policy shocks. The adjustment of the net long positions of hedgers and speculators appears to be a channel through which the monetary policy shocks are propagated to commodity price changes.",2013-01-01,
Strategic Allocation to Commodity Factor Premiums,"In this study we confirm the existence of sizable momentum, carry and low-volatility factor premiums in the commodity market, and argue that investors should consider these commodity factor premiums when determining their strategic asset allocation. We find that diversified portfolios of commodity factor premiums exhibits a significantly better risk-adjusted performance than the commodity market portfolio and adds significant value to a conventional stock/bond portfolio. The traditional commodity market portfolio, on the other hand, appears to deserve little or no role at all in the strategic asset mix. Investors should therefore not postpone the consideration of alternative commodity factor premiums to a later stage of the investment process.",2013-01-01,
Commodities as Collateral,"We propose and test a theory of using commodities as collateral for financing. Under capital control and collateral constraint, investors import commodities and pledge them as collateral to earn higher expected returns. Higher collateral demands increase commodity prices and make the inventory -- convenience yield relation less negative. Our model illustrates these equilibrium effects and suggests that the violation of covered interest-rate parity is a proxy for collateral demands. Evidence from eight commodities in China and developed markets supports the theoretical predictions. Our findings complement the theory of storage and provide new insights into the financialization of commodity markets.",2013-01-01,

Implications of Financialization for Strategic Asset Allocation: The Case of Correlations,"The study concentrates on the benefits of passive commodity investments in the context of the phenomenon of financialization. The research investigates the implications of increase in the correlation coefficients between equity and commodity investments for investors in financial markets. The paper is composed of several parts. First, the attributes of commodity investments and their benefits in the portfolio optimization are explored. Second, the phenomenon of the financialization is described and the research hypothesis is developed. Next, an empirical analysis is performed. I simulate the mean-variance spanning tests to examine the benefits of commodity investments before and after accounting for the impact of financialization. I proceed separate analysis for pre- and post-financialization period. The empirical research is based on asset classes’ returns and other related variables from years 1991-2012. The performed investigations indicate that the market financialization may have significant implications for commodity investors. Due to increase in correlation coefficients, the inclusion of the commodity futures in the traditional stockbond portfolio appears to be no longer reasonable.",2013-01-01,
Are Benefits from Oil - Stocks Diversification Gone? A New Evidence from a Dynamic Copulas and High Frequency Data,"Oil is perceived as a good diversification tool for stock markets. To fully understand this potential, we propose a new empirical methodology that combines generalized autoregressive score copula functions with high frequency data and allows us to capture and forecast the conditional time-varying joint distribution of the oil -- stocks pair accurately. Our realized GARCH with time-varying copula yields statistically better forecasts of the dependence and quantiles of the distribution relative to competing models. Employing a recently proposed conditional diversification benefits measure that considers higher-order moments and nonlinear dependence from tail events, we document decreasing benefits from diversification over the past ten years. The diversification benefits implied by our empirical model are, moreover, strongly varied over time. These findings have important implications for asset allocation, as the benefits of including oil in stock portfolios may not be as large as perceived.",2013-01-01,

Correlations, price return distributions, cointegration, and Granger-causalities are tested in subsamples on monthly FAO Food Price Index and MSCI World Stock Market Index data to better assess why and whether linkages between food and financial markets have increased. Empirical results suggest that while there is only weak indication of greater co-movements concurrent with structural changes such as changed agricultural policies, new demand due to growth in emerging markets and energy mandates, and the financialization of food markets since the early 2000s, they did start to increase in particular substantially during the financial stress of the Lehman crisis and the Great Recession. It is concluded that while structural changes may have amplified price linkages across markets, results do not suggest that they are the key factors for greater price co-movements. Instead, it is discussed that the effects of the late-2000s recession as a time of great economic weakness and uncertainty may have changed concurrently the behavior of both food and financial market participants, such that different market prices exhibit increased co-movements.",2013-01-01,
Concentrated Production and Heavy Tails in Commodity Returns,"I study the impact of commodity production concentration on the occurrence of extreme commodity returns. I explore this issue in a sample of 22 agricultural, mineral and energy commodities of global scope that are liquidly traded through futures at the most important exchanges. I find that measures of production concentration such as the Herfindahl index computed on national shares of global output, or the market share of the top three producers, had significant and positive effect on measures of extreme returns during 1995-2012, as implied by daily return kurtosis or the shape parameter of the distribution of extreme returns. Volatility persistence appears unlikely to generate the cross sectional kurtosis observed empirically unless heavy tailed conditional returns are also included in the dynamics. The results are economically significant and robust to the inclusion of controls for inventories, futures liquidity and country size. These findings are consistent with a simple mechanism of aggregation of globally distributed local supply shocks that impact global supply and hence commodity prices.",2013-01-01,
Decreasing Trends in Stock-Bond Correlations,"Previous research documents the existence of long-run trends in comovements among the stock, bond, and commodities markets. Following these ndings, this paper examines possible trends in realized stock-bond return correlations. To this end, we introduce a trend component into a smooth transition regression (STR) model including the multiple transition variables of Aslanidis and Christiansen (2012). The results indicate the existence of signicant decreasing trends in stock-bond correlations. In addition, although stock market",2013-01-01,
A Novel Efficiency Index for Commodity Futures,"We re-examine the market efficiency of commodity futures using a new approach that accounts for both time-varying risk premium and conditional heteroscedasticity of spot prices. The conventional market efficiency tests so far in the literature are based on either risk neutral or constant risk premium assumptions as such they are biased towards the rejection of the market efficiency hypothesis especially for commodity futures. The time varying risk premium is estimated using a state space model with a modified Kalman filter. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the proposed test produces robust and superior results under varying market conditions compared to the conventional approaches. By employing the proposed test we analyse the efficiency of crude oil, corn, copper and gold futures and find that gold futures is inefficient throughout the sample period 2000-2011 while others are efficient especially after the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008. We also find significant changes in the underlying risk premiums due to the GFC. We extend the analysis to a comprehensive sample of 85 commodities traded on 16 exchanges worldwide and find that efficiency and risk premiums vary across the four market sectors while GFC has caused to increase both efficiency and risk premiums in all markets other than precious metals.",2013-01-01,
The Determinants of Convenience Yields,"In this study, we investigate the determinants of convenience yields across a broad range of commodities. We find that the convenience yields of commodities are exposed to both commodity-specific and systematic factors, but to a different extent. The difference in explanatory power of these factors for each commodity sheds light on the heterogeneity of commodity markets. One main difference between commodity sectors lies in their different sensitivities towards the state of the economy.",2013-01-01,
Short-horizon return predictability and oil prices,"This paper shows that oil price changes, measured as short-term futures returns, are a strong predictor of excess stock returns at short horizons. Ours is a leading variable for the business cycle and exhibits low persistence which avoids the fictitious long-horizon predictability associated with other predictors used in the literature. We compare our variable with the most popular predictors in a sample period that includes the recent financial crisis. Our results suggest that oil price changes are the only variable with forecasting power for stock returns. This significant predictive ability is robust against the inclusion of other variables and out-of-sample tests. We also study the cross-section of expected stock returns in a conditional CAPM framework based on oil price shocks. Our model displays high statistical significance and a better fit than all the conditional and unconditional models considered, including the Fama–French three-factor model. From a practical perspective, ours is a high-frequency, observable variable that has the advantage of being readily available to market-timing investors.",2012-12-01,
Subband prediction of energy commodity prices,"The dynamics of commodity prices has become a major field of analysis in the last 20 years. Standard econometric procedures to describe the behavior of prices have not been able to provide accurate description of the real dynamics. In this paper we apply filter banks to predict prices of specific energy commodities: crude oil, natural gas and electricity, which play a crucial role in the international economic and financial context. Given the high volatility of energy commodity prices, an accurate short term prediction allows to set adequate risk management strategies for producers, retailers and consumers. Filter banks for subband decompositions of the sequences to be predicted are proposed in the paper, allowing the implementation of a parallel computing system to get faster and more accurate implementation. The prediction system is based on a neural model trained on each subband according to specific training and prediction techniques.",2012-06-01,
Has the U.S. Finance Industry Become Less Efficient? On the Theory and Measurement of Financial Intermediation,"I provide a quantitative interpretation of financial intermediation in the U.S. over the past 130 years.Measuring separately the cost of intermediation and the production of financial services, I find that: (i) the quantity of intermediation varies a lot over time; (ii) intermediation is produced under constant returns to scale; (iii) the annual cost of intermediation is around 2% of outstanding assets; (iv) adjustments for borrowers' quality are quantitatively important; and (v) the unit cost of intermediation has increased over the past 30 years.",2012-05-01,

The Stock Market Price of Commodity Risk,"We find that commodity risk is priced in the cross-section of US stock returns. Following the financialization of commodities, investors hedge commodity price risk directly in the futures market, primarily via commodity index investments, whereas before they gained commodity exposure mainly via the stock market. As a result, we find that the annualized average returns of high-minus-low commodity beta stocks change from -8% pre-financialization to 11% post-financialization. As stock market investors increasingly participate in commodity futures markets, stock market risk is also priced in the cross-section of commodity futures returns.",2012-01-01,
The Synchronized and Long-Lasting Structural Change on Commodity Markets: Evidence from High Frequency Data,"This paper analyses the intraday co-movements between returns on several commodity markets and on the stock market in the United States over the 1997-2011 period. By exploiting a new high frequency database, we compute various rolling correlations at (i) 1-hour, (ii) 5-minute, (iii) 10-second, and (iv) 1-second frequencies. Using this database, we document a synchronized structural break, characterized by a departure from zero, which starts in the course of 2008 and continues thereafter. This is consistent with the idea that recent financial innovations on commodity futures exchanges, in particular the high frequency trading activities and algorithm strategies have an impact on these correlations.",2012-01-01,
Improving Time-Series Momentum Strategies: The Role of Trading Signals and Volatility Estimators,"Motivated by studies of the impact of frictions on asset prices, we examine the effect of key components of time-series momentum strategies on turnover and performance. We show that more efficient volatility estimation and price trend detection can significantly reduce portfolio turnover by more than one third, without causing statistically significant performance degradation. We propose a novel implementation of the strategy that incorporates the pairwise signed correlations by means of a dynamic leverage mechanism. The correlation-adjusted variant outperforms the naive implementation of the strategy and the outperformance is more pronounced in the post-2008 period. Finally, using a transaction costs model for futures-based strategies that separates costs into roll-over and rebalancing costs, we show that our findings remain robust to the inclusion of transaction costs.",2012-01-01,
A Gold Bubble?,In this paper we use a test developed by Phillips et al. (2011) to identify a bubble in the gold market. We find that the price of gold followed an explosive price process between 2002 and 2012 interrupted only briefly by the subprime crisis in 2008. We also provide a theoretical foundation for such bubble tests based on a behavioural model of heterogeneous agents and demonstrate that periods of explosive price behaviour are consistent with increased chartist activity in the gold market. The identification strategy yields economically intuitive results and is a simple alternative to using more complex estimation techniques commonly used in the heterogenous agents literature.,2012-01-01,
Futures Trading and the Excess Comovement of Commodity Prices,"We empirically reinvestigate the issue of the excess co-movement of commodity prices initially raised in Pindyck and Rotemberg (1990). Excess co-movement appears when commodity prices remain correlated even after adjusting for the impact of fundamentals. We use recent developments in large approximate factor models to consider a richer information set and adequately model these fundamentals. We consider a set of eight unrelated commodities along with 184 real and nominal macroeconomic variables, from developed and emerging economies, from which nine factors are extracted over the 1993-2013 period. Our estimates provide evidence of time-varying excess co-movement which is only occasionally significant. We further show that speculative intensity is a driver of the estimated excess co-movement, as speculative trading is both correlated across the commodity futures markets and correlated with the futures prices. Our results can be taken as direct evidence of the significant impact of financialization on commodity-price cross-moments.",2012-01-01,
Are There Common Factors in Commodity Futures Returns?,"We explore whether there are common factors in the cross-section of individual commodity futures returns. We test various asset pricing models which have been employed for the equities market as well as models motivated by commodity pricing theories. The use of these families of models allows us also to test whether the commodities and equities market are integrated. In addition, we employ Principal Components factor models which do not require à priori specification of factors. We find that none of the models is successful. Our results imply that commodity markets are segmented from the equities market and they are considerably heterogeneous per se.",2012-01-01,
The Long-Run Relationship of Gold and Silver and the Influence of Bubbles and Financial Crises,This paper analyzes the long-run relationship between gold and silver prices. We closely follow Escribano and Granger (1998) and extend their study. We use a longer sample period from 1970-2011 and study the role of bubbles and financial crises for the relationship between gold and silver prices. We find clear evidence for a co-integration relationship between gold and silver with gold prices driving the relationship. The analysis also indicates that the results are influenced by bubble-like episodes and financial crises.,2012-01-01,
Portfolio Selection with Commodities Under Conditional Asymmetric Dependence and Skew Preferences,"This article investigates the portfolio selection problem of an investor with three-moment preferences taking positions in commodity futures. To model the asset returns, we propose a conditional asymmetric t copula with skewed and fat-tailed marginal distributions, such that we can capture the impact on optimal portfolios of time-varying moments, state-dependent correlations, and tail and asymmetric dependence. In the empirical application with oil, gold, and equity data from 1990 to 2010, the conditional t copulas portfolios achieve better performance than those based on more conventional strategies. The specification of higher moments in the marginal distributions and the type of tail dependence in the copula have significant implications for the out-of-sample portfolio performance.",2012-01-01,
Globally Distributed Production and the Pricing of CME Commodity Futures,"I investigate how local supply shocks in the globally distributed production of commodities are incorporated into CME futures prices. I exploit that the soybean market share of the US (Argentina) decreased (increased) between 1996 and 2010, and use rain, which tends to increase output, as a source of exogenous supply shocks. I find a significantly negative response of CME soybean prices to daily rain across regions and time. Moreover, the impact of local rain in the CME price is approximately linear in the time-varying local share of global output. Therefore, traders of CME contracts seem to aggregate supply in a globally integrated manner and are exposed to globally distributed shocks.",2012-01-01,
Financialization of commodities,"The basic theory of price formation tells us how the price of a particular asset will change based on the adjustment to its supply and demand.However, values of assets are also determined by other business fundamentals, company's and world events, human psychology, and investors' belief about the possible future profit.In recent history that lead to an increase of individual and institutional investors' interest in allocating their resources in commodity markets.With a large inflow of capital commodities' prices started to rise making them attractive components to effective investment portfolios.The presented paper addresses the issue of so called commodities 'financialization' process.It looks at the main factors standing behind commodities' price movements and to what extent financial market participants contributed to commodities price volatility in recent years.Based on the data examined it distinguishes the involvement of both commercial and non-commercial traders in short and long term periods of time.As well as explaining the impact of growing investors' interest in commodity markets it defines other market forces -like currency appreciations and emerging markets -as being part of increased volatility in raw and soft commodity markets.Along with market examination the paper focuses on possible future outcomes in attempts to regulate commodities derivatives markets and potential effects of those efforts.",2011-12-27,

The report begins with a discussion of volatility and of the ways in which volatility affects countries, businesses, consumers and farmers. Lessons learned from recent experiences are briefly reviewed as well as the factors determining likely levels of volatility in future. This report offers suggestions for a systematic and internationally coordinated response building on the lessons learned as a result of the 2007-2008crisis. It is important to distinguish between policy options designed to prevent or reduce price volatility and those designed to mitigate its consequences. Both types of intervention are explored in detail. Scope is identified for actions at individual, national, regional and international level. Some would help to avert a threat; others are in the nature of contingency plans to improve readiness, while still others address long-term issues of resilience. Finally, the report explores mechanisms of international cooperation to implement this report's recommendations and to monitor progress.

Does 'Paper Oil' Matter? Energy Markets’ Financialization and Equity-Commodity Co-Movements,"We document new facts regarding the financialization of U.S. energy futures markets between 2000 and 2010. We use this information to show that, after controlling for macroeconomic and energy-market fundamentals, co-movements between energy and stock markets increase significantly amid greater energy paper-market activity by hedge funds—especially funds that are active in both equity and energy markets. The connection to hedge fund activity weakens at time of financial market stress. We find, in contrast, no link between the strength of energy-equity market return correlations and the positions of commodity index traders. Our results have implications for the ongoing debate about the financialization of commodity markets.",2011-01-01,

Market Sentiment in Commodity Futures Returns,"We identify a strong presence of sentiment exposure in commodity futures returns. Sentiment is able to provide additional explanatory power for comovement among commodity futures beyond the macro- and equity-related sources. Commodity futures with low open interest growth, high volatilities, low momentum, or low futures basis are more sensitive to change in sentiment. Similar to Baker and Wurgler (2006), we construct a market sentiment index by Partial Least Squares regressions (PLS) with non-return based stock market proxies, in particular higher moments of the option implied return distribution. Moreover, our sentiment index can be built on a daily basis.",2011-01-01,
