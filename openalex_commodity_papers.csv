AN ANALYTICAL STUDY ON STOCK FUTURES AND OPTIONS DERIVATIVES TRADING IN INDIA,"This study looks at financial derivatives, specifically options and futures. To protect against changes in the value of fundamental assets including stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and stock indexes, derivative tools are used. Since the Indian derivatives market is still relatively new and not well known to all investors, SEBI must take action to raise awareness of this industry. The market price of the underlying asset immediately affects an investor's profit or loss in the cash market, which could lead to significant gains or losses. Onthe other hand, investors can minimize their downside risk and make substantial profits through the derivatives market. Hedging is the primary usage of derivatives. SEBI should think about changing several rules, such as those pertaining to contract size and the participation of Foreign Institutional Investors (Flis) in the derivatives market, in order to promote the expansion of the Indian derivatives industry. All things considered, this study sheds light on the derivatives market. Keywords: Premium, Maturity Time, Strike Price, And Spot Price",2025-04-16,
COMMUNICATION STRATEGY OF UKRAINIAN BUSINESS EXPORTERS IN THE CONTEXT OF GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGES,"The article provides a theoretical and methodological grounds for the communication strategy for exporters as an integral component of business promotion in the international market; systematizes the main determinants which influence the formation of a communication strategy, namely, target audience segmentation and profiling, optimal means of information transmission selection, key messages, assessment of the communication and marketing strategy effectiveness, including a set of measures ensuring clear, consistent and attractive communication. Besides, it analyzes the challenges and problems of Ukrainian exporters in the international market, including the imperfection of infrastructure, insufficient development of financial mechanisms to support exporters, the dependence of the dynamics of Ukrainian exports on changes in the world market conditions and high import dependence, currency fluctuations, political situation and changes in international trade agreements; presents analytical information on Ukrainian commodity exports in conditions of instability in the world markets of agricultural and metallurgical products. A certain set of tools for implementing an international communication strategy is proposed, in particular, participation in exhibitions, digital and content marketing, PR companies to build a positive image and of national product brands which emphasize USP and competitiveness in the foreign market. The article concludes that the communication strategy of Ukrainian business exporters requires a detailed study of local conditions, cultural, demographic, psychological and economic factors which give opportunity for a more accurate determination of international consumers needs and priorities, in other words, a strategic rethinking of export orientation policy and its adaptation in the context of geopolitical challenges.",2025-04-14,
DEVELOPMENT TRENDS OF INTERNATIONAL DERIVATIVES EXCHANGE TRADING IN THE CONDITIONS OF GLOBALIZATION,"The article highlights the close connection between the development of international exchange trading in derivative contracts and the processes of globalization and especially its negative consequences, in particular global events, such as military conflicts and trade wars, which are currently ongoing. It is noted that globalization, as a world-wide process, cannot be stopped, even if it has negative consequences. Today, globalization covers all spheres of economic activity of market participants at both the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels. It is noted that one of the important and key conditions of globalization is its close connection with the political situation and political sentiments of society around the world. In our opinion, the impact of globalization on public opinion and international derivatives trading directly depends on the political situation and political decisions of countries, which significantly affect the globalization process. The impact of globalization intensified at the end of the last century. It is revealed that the openness and transparency of economic relations between market participants at the global level creates tension and instability, which leads to high price volatility on international exchanges. It is noted that the main tools in the fight against price risks are exchange-traded derivative contracts for the main types of commodity and financial assets. It is noted that the main directions of development of international exchange trading in derivative contracts include: growth in trading volumes in futures and options contracts; increased demand for exchange instruments due to the continuation of the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical changes; creation of favorable conditions for financial security to guarantee the execution of exchange transactions; expansion of the spectrum of exchange brokers duties; growth in the share of financial derivatives trading in the overall structure of international exchange trading; achievement of new record trading indicators on international exchanges; tokenization of exchange trading processes and use of A.I. in the development of innovative exchange strategies for trading in derivative contracts.",2025-04-14,
Futures Trading and Corporate Financialization: A Quasi‐Natural Experiment From the Launch of China's Crude Oil Futures,"ABSTRACT This study examines the impact of China's crude oil futures trading on corporate decision‐making at the firm level. By analyzing Chinese listed companies spanning from 2010 to 2022, we identify a significant negative causality of China's crude oil futures trading on the degree of financialization in energy‐dependent enterprises. Mechanism analysis further demonstrates that China's crude oil futures trading substantially strengthens corporate risk management capacity, thereby reducing precautionary motivations for financial asset holdings. Specifically, energy‐dependent firms exhibit a marked propensity to reallocate short‐term liquidity from financial investments to crude oil futures positions. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of China's crude oil futures on the financialization level of energy‐dependent firms is more pronounced among state‐owned enterprises and firms facing heightened competitive pressures. This paper offers micro‐level insights into the relationship between commodity futures trading and corporate decision‐making, emphasizing the significance of financial innovation in supporting China's real economy development.",2025-04-14,
The Influence of the International Oil Price on the EUR/USD Exchange Rate,"The study analyses the influence of the international oil price, focusing on the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index and Brent crude oil, on the main exchange rates: EUR/GBP, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY. The analysis covers the period from 3 January 2022 to 8 December 2024 to examine the relationship between fluctuations in the oil market and the behaviour of exchange rates. The results show that the CBOE index directly impacts the EUR/GBP currency pair, reflecting the influence of global volatility on financial markets. The EUR/USD pair is influenced by the behaviour of the USD/JPY currency pair, showing the interconnection between the major currencies. Brent futures significantly affect the USD/CHF and USD/JPY currency pairs due to the importance of oil as a strategic commodity and the sensitivity of currencies such as the Yen and Swiss franc to fluctuations in energy prices. These relationships show the strong interconnectedness of global markets, highlighting the importance of informed risk management and decision-making strategies in interdependent environments.",2025-04-14,
Metaheuristic Optimization for Multi Item Supply Chains with Price Indices and Advance Payment,"Abstract Business organizations might gain competitive advantages by employing optimal strategies on various aspects of their operations such as pricing, sales effort, product quality, price index and backlogging. In the present article, collaborative and non-collaborative policies for a multi-item two-echelon supply chain (SC) with advance payment are proposed. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) have a substantial impact on commodity prices. In order to maintain the customer purchasing power and profitability, a SC inventory model is developed to study pricing strategies by considering WPI at the manufacturer level and CPI at the retailer level. The centralized and decentralized policies have been suggested to account for the changes in the general price level to maintain consumer buying power. The price and sales team effort dependent demand is considered to evaluate the optimal gross profit, production rate, manufacturer’s cycle duration, shortage time, selling price and initiatives of sales team. The prediction of backlog periods is also helpful for uninterrupted operations and customer satisfaction. For optimization and sensitivity analysis, numerical results are computed and compared using two different metaheuristic approaches namely differential evolution algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The analysis shows that the WPI and CPI have a substantial impact on commodity prices, which makes the profit function vulnerable to variations in the inflation rate. For SC participants, the provision of advance payment arrangements may enhance the cash flow and financial predictability.",2025-04-09,
Kesesuaian Syariah Simpanan Sembako Terhadap Akad Wadiah di KSPPS Artha Yasmin Az-Zahra Jepara dalam Perspektif Fatwa DSN-MUI Nomor 02/DSN-MUI/IV/2000,"Basic food items such as rice, eggs, sugar, and milk play a crucial role in people's lives, especially during the month of Ramadan, when demand for these commodities increases significantly. This condition encourages the habit of storing food, which then gives birth to innovations in basic food savings products in Islamic financial institutions. This study aims to examine the application of the wadiah contract in basic food savings products at the Artha Yasmin Az Zahra Sharia Savings and Loans and Financing Cooperative (KSPPS), with reference to the fatwa of the National Sharia Council of the Indonesian Ulema Council (DSN-MUI) Number 02/DSN-MUI/IV/2000. The research method used is qualitative descriptive, with data collection techniques through interviews, observations, and documentation studies. The results of the study indicate that KSPPS Artha Yasmin Az Zahra applies the wadiah contract in the form of pure deposits, where the funds deposited by members are used to buy basic food items which will later be returned according to the agreed agreement. Although the implementation of the wadiah contract is in accordance with the provisions of the DSN-MUI fatwa, there are still obstacles, such as the lack of transparency in conveying information about the contract to members, which has the potential to affect their level of trust in this product. This study is expected to provide useful insights for KSPPS managers in improving the governance of basic food savings to be more in accordance with sharia principles and more transparent for its members.",2025-04-04,
Agricultural mechanization perspective in Pakistan: present challenges and digital future,"Agriculture constitutes a critical sector within the economic landscape of Pakistan, engaging 37.4% of the labour force and contributing 22.9% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), thus functioning as an essential element of the country's economic architecture and the sustenance of its citizens. The primary agricultural commodities, which encompass wheat, rice, cotton, maize, and sugarcane, occupy extensive tracts of agricultural land, thereby underscoring their paramount importance regarding food security, impacts on territory management and related landscape, as well as income generation through export activities. Despite its crucial role, the advancement of agricultural mechanization in Pakistan is significantly lacking, with the available agricultural power that is a little less than 1.6 kW ha-1, which is below the minimum required farm power of 1.82 kW ha-1. In this study, we seek to investigate the historical evolution, current scenario, and significant obstacles confronting agricultural mechanization in Pakistan, especially right now when innovative trends worldwide are pushing towards a progressive digitisation of the sector. Continuing with the conventional agricultural practices during the period of independence in 1947, the Green Revolution of the 1960s represented a crucial transformation towards mechanization, propelled by the indigenous manufacturing of tractors. Nevertheless, the pace of mechanization has slowed in recent years, primarily due to the prevalence of small farm sizes, economic constraints, and inadequate access to financial resources. While tasks such as land preparation and pesticide application have achieved notable levels of mechanization, fundamental operations including sowing, transplanting, weeding, and harvesting continue to be insufficiently mechanized. Significant initiatives, such as Laser Land Levelling in Punjab, show the considerable impact of focused interventions. To address the mechanization deficit, proposed strategies encompass the enhancement of local machinery manufacturing, the establishment of quality standards, the promotion of advanced imported equipment, an increase in farmer education, and the implementation of comprehensive government support through subsidies, tax benefits, and dedicated research and development efforts. A collaborative approach between governmental bodies and the private sector is imperative for fostering advancements in mechanization, thereby ensuring a more efficient, productive, and sustainable agricultural sector in Pakistan.",2025-04-04,
Measurement of riskiness of agricultural income - evidence from India's agrarian economy,"Farmers in developing countries face significant challenges due to price and production fluctuations, which impact their income and well-being. This study focuses on potato and onion farmers in India to estimate the income variability experienced by them. This research applies the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to investigate how fluctuations in market prices influence agricultural supply, with an emphasis on both short- and long-term effects. The demand elasticity (ε) for potato is equal to ‒1.32, while for onion, it is 0.54. This study finds that income volatility is a significant issue for potato and onion farmers, which could impact the long-term well-being of the farmers in India. Price fluctuations in agricultural production, combined with lower market prices, pose serious threats to farmers' income. To reduce risks, the study recommends comprehensive strategies, such as improved price stabilization initiatives, agricultural income insurance, and financial tools like commodity derivatives. In particular, it suggests considering index-based income insurance that provides compensation based on specific indicators, such as regional yield and price changes. These measures can enhance financial security and resilience for Indian farmers facing market uncertainties.",2025-04-03,
Economic growth and inflation,"The article examines economic growth, which characterizes the value increase in output in an economic system over a certain period of time. According to the authors, quantitative indicators of economic growth reflect only one aspect of the development of the economic system. To understand the ongoing economic processes, it is necessary to identify the qualitative characteristics of development, justifying the relationship of economic growth indicators with other macroeconomic indicators: inflation, the key rate of the Bank of Russia, unemployment, and others. This will allow us to assess the degree of balanced development of the entire economic system, its resistance to the disturbing effects of the external and internal economic environment. To ensure economic growth, a set of regulatory measures by the state is needed to support the activity of commercial structures. An analysis of various scientific and theoretical approaches of foreign and Russian economic scientists to the problem of achieving economic growth shows the relationship of this category with the instruments and methods of financial and monetary policy used by the executive authorities and the Bank of Russia. The article notes that the practical application of such methods does not fully meet the goals of economic development. The current model of the Russian economy is more consistent with the concept of oligarchic capitalism. This characterizes the increasing wealth of individuals and the social stratification of society. It is revealed that inflation occurs as a result of imbalance in commodity and foreign exchange markets. The objective basis and root cause of the inflationary process, according to the authors, is the devaluation of the ruble. Therefore, the inflationary process must be calculated taking into account the currency component (changes in the exchange rate).It is concluded that the problems of economic development have required drastic institutional changes in the country using a variety of financial instruments, special attention should be paid to the digitalization of economic processes, the implementation of major investment projects in the field of infrastructure.",2025-04-01,

As a result, measures are proposed to improve the efficiency of the agricultural enterprise.",2025-04-01,
Economic Disobedience and Alternative Economies: The Role of Boycotts and Informal Trade Networks in Contesting State Authority in Cameroon’s North West Region,"In this study, I examine economic disobedience as a potent form of resistance within the North West Region of Cameroon, where targeted boycotts and informal trade networks actively challenge the authority of the central state. Drawing on fieldwork conducted from March to June 2023 in key areas of the North West Region of Cameroon, focusing on economic disobedience and informal trade, in-depth interviews, and local financial data analysis, this paper adopts an analytical framework rooted in the theories of monetary sovereignty and resistance economies as articulated by Scott (1985) and Bayart (1993). This approach illuminates how communities in this region mobilize economic defiance in response to perceived state neglect and governance inadequacies.The findings reveal that boycotts against enterprises and commodities associated with the state have evolved from spontaneous acts of dissent into organized economic strategies that serve as symbolic rejections of state control. These boycotts represent a calculated form of economic independence, manifesting as a collective, politicized decision to withdraw participation from economic channels regulated by the state, which local actors perceive as oppressive. Furthermore, the research sheds light on the role of informal trade networks, especially those facilitating cross-border transactions with Nigeria, as alternative economic systems that bypass official state mechanisms. Such networks effectively mitigate critical supply shortages, circumvent state-imposed tariffs and taxes, and undermine the government’s regulatory influence over the region’s economy.These forms of economic disobedience expand upon the notion of resistance economies (Scott, 1985; Bayart, 1993), framing ""economic disobedience"" as intentional acts of defiance that assert economic sovereignty and agency, thereby undermining state authority and destabilizing formal economic systems within the region. While rooted in pragmatic economic responses to state marginalization, this defiance enhances the fragility of state power in areas where informal economies are deeply embedded, and formal compliance remains insubstantial. These findings invite a reconsideration of economic governance approaches in politically contested regions, demonstrating that alternative economies and systematic disobedience not only disrupt formal economic structures but also empower marginalized communities to re-envision their economic agency and autonomy. Thus, this study makes a substantive contribution to the discourse on resistance economies, illustrating how economic dissent can destabilize state structures and redefine local conceptions of authority and independence. It also advances defiant scholarship in Africa by highlighting grassroots economic resistance as a reimagining of agency and power in postcolonial contexts.",2025-03-31,
Marine trader’s method of payment and level of satisfaction towards infrastructural facilities of dry ports in India – an empirical study,"All commodities and services moved by sea require at least two seaports; the importance of seaports to the smooth operation of an economy cannot be overstated. Maritime transport is used for most of the domestic and international trade (import/export). Due to a shortage of contemporary equipment and human resources throughout India, the shipping industry is experiencing delays in the transportation process for both imports and exports. Further shipping industry personalities are facing financial challenges related to the overseas transaction between two or more countries due to the huge payment formalities in India. India’s shipping industry one of the backbones of Indian economy. In near future, the ministry of commerce and industry must take considerable steps for improving the effective method of payments as well as marine traders level satisfaction towards developing infrastructural facilities in dry port for utilize the great opportunities of shipping industry earnings to strengthen the India’s BOP position as well as economic position and export-import volume in the world trade market.",2025-03-31,
Sustainability of modular refinery operation in Nigeria: Product quality and value chain,"The modular refineries in Nigeria have the potential to create a bigger quantity of commodities while keeping the quality of those goods, and to deliver those products to their end customers in a manner that is both more expedient and more cost-effective. As a method of contributing to the nation's energy security and economic expansion, the purpose of this evaluation is to evaluate and improve the long-term sustainability of the product quality and value chain of modular refineries. To compile articles pertinent to the subject, ""Google scholar"" was used. To perform the analysis on the data that was obtained, methodologies for the foresight and analysis of material and energy projects, descriptive statistics, and life cycle cost analysis were used. Using the right techniques of financial management for infrastructure projects, indicators of profitability were estimated. These indicators included levelized costs of petroleum products, Net Present Value (NPV), Break-even and Payback Period, and return on investment. According to the findings, to assure the ongoing growth of modular refinery operations in Nigeria, it is vital to have a strategy that is both comprehensive and well-coordinated. Modular refineries can realize their full potential, which would contribute to energy security, economic prosperity, and environmental responsibility. For Nigeria to be able to establish a modular refinery sector that is both sustainable and profitable in its product quality and value chain, it is required for government agencies, industry players, and local communities to be committed and engaged in the process.",2025-03-30,
Трансформация структуры индийской внешней торговли в условиях антироссийских санкций: на примере товарного экспорта,"Особенностью индийской внешней торговли является ее дефицитный хронический характер, который берет свое начало с момента обретения страной независимости. Предпосылкой к его складыванию первоначально явилось серьезное отставание в уровне развития производительных сил, что потребовало, в свою очередь, масштабного обращения к закупкам технологий, станков и промышленной продукции для создания новых предприятий или модернизации уже существующих предприятий отраслей индийской промышленности. Реализация Пятилетних Планов, идеалов модернизации и целей экономической и промышленной политики потребовали еще больших закупок импортной продукции. Актуальность данного исследования определена тем, что за последние 24 финансовых года в динамике, географии и номенклатуре внешней торговле Индии произошли очень значительные изменения, связанные не только с трансформацией национальной и внешней экономической политики, либерализацией внешней торговли и инвестиционной сферы, но и геополитическими факторами, а именно: вводом антироссийских санкций, разворотом российской внешней торговли «на Восток», увеличением Индией закупки российских энергоносителей и, как следствие, усилением позиций Индии на мировом рынке топливно-энергетических ресурсов. Авторами было выявлено изменение не только географии, но и номенклатуры индийского товарного экспорта в направлении стран — экспортеров сырья и топливно-энергетических ресурсов. Однако, потенциально возможное воздействие на Правительство Индии со стороны США, может, некоторым образом, изменить текущее положение дел. Gardening The peculiarity of Indian foreign trade is its chronic deficit, which dates back to the country's independence. The prerequisite for its formation was initially a serious lag in the level of development of the productive forces, which required, in turn, a large-scale approach to the purchase of technologies, machine tools and industrial products to create new enterprises or modernize existing enterprises in Indian industries. The implementation of Five-year Plans, modernization ideals, and economic and industrial policy goals required even greater purchases of imported products. The relevance of this study is determined by the fact that over the past 24 financial years, very significant changes have taken place in the dynamics, geography and nomenclature of India's foreign trade, related not only to the transformation of national and foreign economic policy, the liberalization of foreign trade and investment, but also to geopolitical factors, namely, the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions, the reversal of Russian foreign trade «to the East», India's increased purchases of Russian energy resources and, as a result, the strengthening of India's position in the global market of fuel and energy resources. The authors revealed a change not only in the geography, but also in the nomenclature of Indian commodity exports in the direction of exporting countries of raw materials and fuel and energy resources. However, the potential impact on the Indian Government from the United States may change the current state of affairs in some way.",2025-03-29,
Mapping The Web Of Knowledge: A Bibliometric Analysis Of Stock Markets Interlinkage,"The current study aims to provide an overview of existing research on stock market interlinkage and recommend further research directions. The study performed a bibliometric analysis of 1537 Scopus-indexed papers published since 2000 using biblioshiny under the bibliometrix R package. It describes the status of publications, publication trend, the top productive contributor, the leading influential contributor, the most frequently used keywords, important themes, research collaboration network, co-citation network, and scope of future research. Overall, this analysis contributes to a better understanding of the linkage between stock markets and provides insights for policymakers, managers, analysts, investors, and researchers in this field. More research needs to be conducted to investigate the connections between various financial markets, including the stock, bond, commodity, and currency markets, using statistical models with machine learning algorithms to understand better how financial market interlinkage can affect diversification opportunities and risk management strategies",2025-03-29,
"The role of integrated prawn farming in climate change adaptation in Bangladesh: ecosystem services, economic viability and barriers","The integrated rice-prawn-vegetable culture (RPVC) is an effective farming method that ensures the efficient utilization of water and land. This study aims to evaluate the role of RPVC in climate change adaptation, its ecosystem services, and economic sustainability in Bangladesh. Integrated RPVC provides farmers with ecosystem services, including reducing use of the fertilizers and insecticides and lowering financial instability. The vegetable platform shades prawn ponds naturally, while prawns consume insects in rice fields. After rice plants are harvested, their roots can serve as food for prawns. Majority of the respondents (85%) reported that adopting RPVC increased the overall productivity. Farmers faced a variety of climatic hazards; ranked as: drought (86.3%) &gt; erratic and sudden heavy rainfall (81.5%) &gt; temperature fluctuation (69.6%) &gt; salinity intrusion (67.2%) &gt; storm (28.5%). The ecosystem services provided by RPVC helped farmers to mitigate the adverse impacts of these climate-induced challenges through ecosystem-based adaptation. Integrated RPVC has also enabled farmers to maintain a consistent cash flow throughout the year. By promoting the production of multiple commodities—rice, prawns, and vegetables—the system reduces the risk of financial destitution. Despite benefits, farmers also encountered several challenges in implementing RPVC including water shortage (85.2%), disease (73.5%), theft (60.4%), increased feed costs (70.7%), lack of information (65%), increased labor cost (58.8%), and not getting expected market value of farming products (63.2%). However, if these barriers are addressed, the integrated RPVC system holds significant potential to foster long-term socio-economic growth in the southwest region of Bangladesh.",2025-03-28,
The Parameter on the Obligation of Zakat on the Pledge Asset to Collateralised Commodity Murabahah,"Purpose — Collateralised Commodity Murābaḥah (CCM) is a product utilised by Islamic banking institutions as a liquidity management instrument to ensure their financial sustainability. One of the key features of this product is the presence of an asset classified as a High-Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA), which is pledged as collateral for the incidental debt of the deferred payment required by the murābaḥah contract between the purchasing bank and the financing bank. Although the asset is pledged as collateral, it remains under the ownership of the purchasing bank. Due to that, following the opinion of the majority of the jurists, the bank, as the asset owner, is obligated to pay zakat. The question posed is: what are the parameters to substantiate this argument? This study therefore explores the Sharīʿah perspective on the obligation to pay zakat on assets pledged as collateral for a debt created by the CCM product. It also discusses the reasoning applied to this fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) opinion. This is done to propose a parameter applicable to determine the zakatability of pledged assets in the CCM agreement. Design/Methodology/Approach — This study employed a qualitative research methodology. It collected data through inductive document analysis and semi-structured interviews searching for the views of the fuqahāʾ (Islamic scholars) and relevant respondents with regards to the obligation of zakat on the pledged assets. The collected data was then analysed using a deductive approach by conducting an Islamic juridical analytical process to derive the applicable fiqh opinion for pledged assets used as collateral in the CCM product. Findings — This research proposes full ownership and growth as two additional parameters to use together with other existing zakat parameters in establishing the zakatability of the pledged asset in the CCM product. Originality/Value — This research discusses a grey area with respect to zakat obligations of business institutions. It proposes new elements to be taken into account by the institutions as their self-regulatory benchmark to ensure they contribute towards the sustainability of societal progress via the zakat instrument. Practical Implications — These parameters are applicable as a self-regulatory benchmark for Islamic banks to ensure that they fulfil their responsibility as institutions that uphold Islamic values in their business. The findings also have the potential to be applied by regulators such as Bank Negara Malaysia and religious authorities in Malaysia as additional elements of zakat parameters for the financial institutions under its regulation.",2025-03-27,
A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Rice Plant Disease Detection,"The agricultural sector necessitates automated identification and analysis of rice diseases to conserve financial and other resources, mitigate yield loss, enhance processing efficiency, and secure healthy crop harvests. Rice is an essential commodity for global food security; however, it is very vulnerable to numerous illnesses that can markedly diminish productivity. Timely identification and precise forecasting of these diseases are crucial for reducing losses. Conventional image-based disease detection techniques frequently utilise Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatial information; however, they inadequately account for the temporal evolution of diseases, which is essential for efficient monitoring and diagnosis. This research proposes a hybrid model that integrates a Hierarchical Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (HCRNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for the prediction of rice plant illnesses. The HCRNN extracts multi-scale spatial characteristics from rice plant pictures, whilst the LSTM network models temporal relationships in disease progression, hence augmenting predicting capabilities. This integrated methodology enhances performance by integrating spatial and temporal information. We assessed the model using a dataset of rice plant leaf pictures impacted by multiple diseases, including bacterial leaf blight, blast, and sheath blight. The proposed model exhibited enhanced performance, with an accuracy of 98.5%, above that of conventional CNN-based models. This method also resolves the challenge of limited datasets by accurately tracking disease development across time. The findings indicate that the integration of HCRNN with LSTM establishes a resilient framework for predicting rice diseases. The suggested approach is adaptable to additional crops and disease categories, providing a scalable solution for precision agriculture and disease management. Subsequent efforts will concentrate on incorporating environmental variables, including soil and meteorological data, to augment predictive accuracy.",2025-03-27,
Synthetic Assets: New Finance Instruments and New Investment Opportunities,"The article discusses the concept of new financial instruments, known as synthetic assets, which combine traditional finance with blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). These synthetic assets are digital tokens that are created artificially using derivatives. They aim to replicate the characteristics of realworld assets, such as stocks, commodities, and currencies, allowing investors to access these assets without owning them directly. These platforms are powered by smart contracts, which enable access to previously inaccessible markets. The author examines the various classifications, operational models, advantages, regulatory challenges, and potential for future growth and integration of synthetic assets into the global financial system. These synthetic assets are classified based on their underlying asset and liquidity/maturity, and their functionality is based on real-time price predictions transmitted through external tools to the blockchain. Key operational principles for synthetic assets include imitating the behavior of their underlying assets, decentralized operation through the use of smart contracts, the use of collateral, often in the form of cryptocurrencies, and mechanisms to increase liquidity. Various strategies, such as the use of derivatives and leverage, are employed in the trading of these assets. The differences between synthetic assets and other financial instruments are discussed. Synthetic assets have several advantages compared to traditional, tokenized, and derivative assets. These include accessibility, improved risk management, partial ownership, lower transaction costs, programmability, and potentially higher liquidity. However, there are also significant risks associated with synthetic assets, such as volatility due to underlying cryptocurrencies, regulatory uncertainty, and the dependence on price forecasts. The author also considers regulatory and law enforcement issues regarding the classification and decentralized nature of these assets.",2025-03-27,
Mitigating Production Risks for Smallholder Soyabean Farmers in Chongwe District: Examining the Role of Commodity Markets,": This study investigates the challenges faced by smallholder soyabean farmers in Chongwe District, Zambia, focusing on mitigating production risks through financial and market-based interventions. Smallholder farmers are highly vulnerable to climate variability, price fluctuations, and limited access to structured risk management tools, which compromise their economic stability and productivity. The study explores the role of micro-insurance, structured commodity markets, and financial literacy initiatives in enhancing resilience among these farmers. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and quantitative surveys conducted among smallholder farmers, the study finds that despite the potential benefits of financial risk management tools such as weather-index insurance and futures contracts, their adoption remains low due to factors such as high costs, limited awareness, and logistical constraints. Additionally, the research highlights that a lack of financial literacy impedes farmers' ability to make informed decisions regarding risk management, further exacerbating economic vulnerability. To address these challenges, the study recommends tailored financial literacy programs, improved accessibility to structured markets, and the development of affordable micro-insurance products suited to smallholder farmers' needs. By bridging the gap between existing financial instruments and farmers' practical realities, these interventions have the potential to enhance agricultural sustainability and economic resilience. The findings contribute to policy discussions aimed at fostering inclusive financial systems and strengthening agricultural risk management frameworks in Zambia and similar contexts in Sub-Saharan Africa.",2025-03-26,
Volatility Modeling of the Impact of Geopolitical Risk on Commodity Markets,"This study analyses the impact of the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) on the volatility of commodity futures returns from 4 January 2010 to 30 June 2023, using Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) models. It expands the research scope to include precious metals, agricultural products, energy, and industrial metals. The study differentiates between the impacts of geopolitical threat events and actions using GPRACT and GPRTHREAT indicators. Findings reveal that negative geopolitical shocks increase commodity returns’ volatility more than positive shocks. Specifically, gold, silver, and natural gas are negatively affected, while wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, zinc, nickel, lead, WTI oil, and Brent oil experience positive effects. Platinum, cocoa, coffee, and copper show no significant impact. These insights highlight the importance of geopolitical risks on commodity market volatility and returns, aiding in risk management and portfolio diversification. Policymakers, financial market stakeholders, and investors can leverage these findings to better understand the GPR’s relationship with commodity markets and develop effective strategies.",2025-03-26,
"Financialisation, interdependence of futures markets and cereal prices’ volatility: what impact on major cereal importing countries? Algerian case study","The aim of our contribution is to take stock of recent developments on futures markets and their impact on physical commodity markets, particularly the cereals market, and how this affects the Algerian economy. To do this, we rely on a theoretical and descriptive analysis of the state of the world markets and local demand for cereals in order to identify the price transmission channels. The analysis reveals a bitter reality in terms of the dependence of physical markets on financial speculators, which does not rule out the hypothesis of an indirect negative impact on economic variables in developing countries, particularly the Algerian economy. However, the development of the agri-food industry is an asset for absorbing the impact of volatile world cereal prices.",2025-03-25,
STRATEGI PEMASARAN IKAN NILA UNTUK KEBERLANJUTAN UNIT BISNIS PERIKANAN UNIVERSITAS MUHAMMADIYAH SIDENRENG RAPPANG,"As a fishery commodity with high economic value, tilapia has great potential to be developed through a planned marketing approach. This study aims to analyze the development strategy of the Fisheries business unit at the University of Muhammadiyah Sidenreng Rappang. This study uses the purposive sampling method to select respondents from UMSR fisheries business unit managers, UMSR academics, and government agencies of Sidenreng Rappang Regency. The data was analyzed using SWOT analysis to identify internal (strengths and weaknesses) as well as external (opportunities and threats) faktors that affect business development. The results of the study show that the main strength of the business unit lies in the fact that the tilapia that is cultivated has excellent quality, due to the professional management system, while the significant weakness is the limitation of marketing networks and financial resources. The biggest opportunity is the support from the Sidenreng Rappang Regency government in the development of tilapia cultivation in the UMSR fishery business unit. However, fierce competition and raw material prices are the main threats. Recommended priority strategies include product diversification by processing tilapia into fillets, nuggets, or other value-added products.

Non-Linear Stock Market Prediction with Support Vector Machines,"In forecasting financial markets using time series data, predicting Future in the financial market data such as Stock prices, currency exchange commodity price, and rates is a difficult but crucial endeavor. We introduced the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for financial market trend prediction using TSA. Because of their intricate patterns and inherent dynamic character, financial market time series data pose a challenge to traditional forecasting methods. The SVM algorithm, which is well-known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data, is used to estimate future market patterns based on historical price and volume data. The study evaluates the effectiveness of SVM in capturing non-linear correlations in financial time while accounting for shifting market and economic conditions. Through in-depth empirical investigation and performance comparison with other forecasting models, this study sheds light on the suitability and precision of SVM in anticipating movements in financial markets. For traders, investors, and scholars studying algorithmic trading and quantitative finance, it has significant ramifications.",2025-03-22,

The ReFi movement in Web3: implications for the Global Commons,"‘ReFi’ is a rapidly emerging movement in the web3 space that seeks to leverage blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to deliver positive real-world impact. While ReFi is short for regenerative finance, regenerative practitioners query the regenerative claims of the movement. This perspective article explains why the regenerative claims of the ReFi movement are under scrutiny and highlights the implications for the Global Commons if the movement does not adhere to regenerative principles. Given that ReFi is a blockchain-enabled movement, the impact of ReFi on the Global Commons is implicitly a blockchain-related concern. This article provides a regenerative practitioner’s perspective on the ReFi movement as a point of reference for blockchain practitioners in the ReFi movement seeking to be a force for good. Long-standing research in ecological economics highlights the negative impacts of over-financialization and commoditization on the natural world. Given that blockchain technology enables more of the world’s natural assets to become commoditized, securitized, and collateralized than ever before, the article asserts that DeFi’s drive to financialize everything could make the Global Commons the next, and final, commodity frontier. It also asserts that the ReFi movement has the potential to reverse this trend if it can genuinely adhere to the regenerative paradigm.",2025-03-21,
Necrofinance and the Mutation of Life and Death into Value in the Atlantic Slave Trade,"Abstract This article puts forward an argument for a close study of the financial practices that developed to facilitate the transatlantic slave trade. While much important scholarship has demonstrated the dehumanizing nature of the commodification of human life through chattel slavery, this article interrogates the processes by which people could be financially transformed into cargo and commodities. Drawing on 18th- and early 19th-century sources from the archives of Lloyd’s, the insurance market, this article argues that the practices and logics of insurance were critical for framing conceptions of enslaved people as both property and cargo, but more critically, produced the language and discursive framing for such claims to be rendered material. Expanding on and building a concept described as necrofinance, this article shows that through business networks, financial practices, and insurance agreements, as well as intimate knowledge derived from first-hand experience of enslaving and subjugating people, underwriters, far from being aloof or distant financiers of slavery, were actively producing the logics and business infrastructures through which it could persist. While people during the transatlantic slave trade were fundamentally made to be seen as commodities for sale, this article explores the processes and structures necessary to make this a financial and economic reality through systems of insurance far removed from the sites of direct enslavement.",2025-03-19,

The impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis on the Food-Energy-Agricultural Inputs Nexus and implications for Economic Resilience,"We use multivariate copula models to assess the asymmetries in tail dependence between agricultural commodity prices (i.e., cereals and meats) and production input prices (i.e., fertilizers, seeds, animal feed and energy). We use monthly observations between January 2000 and May 2022 and split the time in 2009 to assess the results of the financial crisis. We find upper tail dependence between cereals and fertilizers in the pre-2009 period and upper tail dependence between seeds and fertilizers, and energy and fertilizers post-2009. Furthermore, we find strong and symmetric tail dependence between cereals and seeds in both periods. Our findings suggest that the protective nature of CAP has led to moral hazard effects depriving farmers from the incentives that enhance the sector resilience. Furthermore, agro-chemical companies do not seem to exploit the oligopoly market structure and raise prices arbitrarily. Finally, based on our results, we infer on the economic resilience of the agricultural Sector",2025-03-18,
Kerala’s Floral Exports: Insights on the Cut Flower Trade,"This study undertakes a comprehensive examination of Kerala's burgeoning floriculture sector, with a focused inquiry into the dynamics of cut flower production and export performance. Leveraging the region's heterogeneous agro-climatic zones, the analysis documents a marked expansion in cultivation area, production output, and yield metrics from 2014 onward, signaling systemic growth within the industry. While Kerala has achieved significant market penetration in high-value destinations—including the United States, Canada, and Singapore—underscoring the international demand and quality compliance of its products, critical impediments persist. These include logistical inefficiencies in cold-chain management, insufficient governmental policy frameworks, and infrastructural gaps in transportation networks. Furthermore, financialization challenges, such as currency exchange volatility and inadequate insurance frameworks for perishable commodities, exacerbate export-related risks. The study posits that institutional interventions targeting pre- and post-shipment protocols—including streamlined export financing, risk mitigation strategies, and enhanced phytosanitary certification processes—are imperative to sustain competitive parity in global markets. Emphasizing the necessity of public-private partnerships, the analysis advocates for coordinated policy reforms to strengthen supply chain resilience and value-chain integration. By delineating these structural and operational dimensions, this research establishes a foundational framework for strategic policymaking aimed at consolidating Kerala’s foothold in the international floriculture trade while addressing systemic vulnerabilities.",2025-03-18,
Mapping the effects of Spillovers between Energy and Agricultural Futures in context of biofuels: A Bibliometric Approach,"Using bibliometric analysis techniques, we examine relevant publications from major academic databases to map the intellectual structure and evolution of this research domain. Our findings reveal four key themes: co-integration and volatility spillover between energy and agricultural commodities, the role of biofuel policies in price transmission, speculation and financialization in commodity markets, and uncertainty and risk in energy-agriculture linkages. The bibliometric results indicate growing research interest in this area, especially since the 2008 financial crisis, but also highlight gaps in the literature. Specifically, we identify needs for further investigation into asymmetric spillover effects, the impact of speculation, and modeling approaches that integrate economic theory with econometric time series analysis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of existing knowledge on energy-agriculture market interactions and suggests promising directions for future research to inform policy and practice in this critical domain.",2025-03-17,
Comprehensive Comparative Rating Assessment of Meat- Processing Enterprises in the Vologda Region,"The article reflects the results of a comprehensive comparative rating assessment of meat-processing enterprises in the Vologda region, based on a system of indexes that allows us to evaluate, on the one hand, the financial results of the enterprise, and on the other hand, the opinion of those who directly consume its products. The object of the study was 13 meat-processing enterprises – participants of the “True Vologda Product” brand as of 2024, for which an assessment of their financial condition and potential was also carried out. The purpose of the research – comparative assessment and rating of Vologda meat-processing enterprises participating in the voluntary certification system of products “True Vologda Product” based on the original methodology for comparative comprehensive assessment of brand member producers. Materials and methods. The study used a method of multidimensional comprehensive comparative rating assessment of enterprises based on a system of two categories of indexes: indexes for assessing consumer preferences and indexes for assessing the financial condition of enterprises. Comparative comparisons were made with the results of applying this method to the same sample of enterprises obtained during the study conducted in 2020. Information was collected using questionnaire survey methods, standardization and generalization of results, statistical methods, and the rating assessment method. A graphical method was used to present the assessment results. Results. A rating of enterprises was constructed based on the indexes of integrated levels of their comparative assessments, which made it possible to formulate the functional characteristics of meat product manufacturers for the population based on the degree of their participation in ensuring the development potential of the regional commodity brand “True Vologda Product”. The identified problems in the work of the studied enterprises in the industry made it possible to determine the driving factors for the growth of their potential. Conclusion. The analysis of meat-processing producers participating in the brand “True Vologda Product” conducted on the basis of a comprehensive approach allowed us to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these enterprises, which in general allows us to judge the fairly high economic potential for the development of the meat-processing industry in the Vologda region, the availability of opportunities for expanding the sales market both within the region and beyond, including a more intensive expansion of the geography of exports. Products of agricultural origin, made from certified environmentally friendly raw materials, have undeniable competitive advantages compared to products imported from neighboring regions and imported products.",2025-03-17,
Patient blood management – what's the problem with implementation?,"Patient blood management has been utilised increasingly over the past 20 years [1]. Whilst there is not an agreed definition, a recent expert consensus paper emphasises that patient blood management is a patient-centred, evidence-based approach to preserving the patient's own blood, improving safety and, crucially, improving patient outcomes [1]. The world's first comprehensive patient blood management programme began in Western Australia, where data from over 600,000 patients admitted to four major tertiary care hospitals from 2008 to 2014 showed risk-adjusted reductions in hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95%CI 0.67–0.77, p < 0.001); duration of stay (incidence rate ratio 0.85, 95%CI 0.84–0.87, p < 0.001); hospital-acquired infections (OR 0.79 95%CI 0.73–0.86, p < 0.001); and acute myocardial infarction/stroke (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.58–0.82, p < 0.001). In addition, the programme resulted in an estimated £63–78 (US$78–97, €75–94) million in activity-based cost savings of transfusion [2]. A subsequent systematic review published in 2019 (17 studies) showed that the implementation of patient blood management significantly reduced transfusion rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95%CI 0.55–0.68, p < 0.001); number of red blood cell units per patient (mean difference -0.43, 95%CI -0.54 to -0.31, p < 0.001); hospital duration of stay (mean difference -0.45, 95%CI -0.65 to -0.25, p < 0.001); total number of complications (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.74–0.88, p < 0.001); and mortality (RR 0.89, 95%CI 0.80–0.98, p = 0.02) [3]. The Australian experience would suggest that the widespread implementation of patient blood management would achieve major improvements, in both patient outcomes and health economics. However, although patient blood management is simple, effective and evidence-based, uptake is slow and not just in the UK. The World Health Organisation, a staunch advocate of patient blood management, has raised the importance of managing anaemia and, in many instances, blood loss and coagulopathy, because ""taken together, these conditions represent one of the world's biggest, largely preventable, yet greatly underestimated public health and health-economic burdens"" [4]. Warnakulasuriya et al. report on the results of their survey of patient blood management measures in 123 UK hospitals [5]. They found that 30% of hospitals taking part in the survey had no anaemia pathway, with inconsistent policies for haemoglobin optimisation. They also found that only 39% of centres had a tranexamic acid policy and half had access to point-of-care testing. Local policies for the use of cell salvage were not present in 59% of centres overall and in 34% of sites offering obstetric services. Given the clear advantages of implementing patient blood management, the question we must ask is why there is such disparity throughout the UK in its implementation. One answer may lie in the conflicting evidence surrounding its benefits. A network meta-analysis of common patient blood management interventions identified five systematic reviews with over 390 trials including > 50,000 patients and concluded that ""in randomised trials, patient blood management interventions do not have important clinical benefits beyond reducing bleeding and transfusion in people undergoing major surgery"" [6]. Conversely, Althoff et al. in their meta-analysis found that ""a comprehensive patient blood management program addressing all three patient blood management pillars is associated with reduced transfusion, need of red blood cell units, lower complication and mortality rate, and thereby improving clinical outcome"" [3]. The publication of the PREVENTT study has also been considered a barrier to the support for pre-operative intravenous iron after the widely anticipated trial concluded that pre-operative intravenous iron administration did not improve survival or reduce transfusion requirements [7]. This lack of consensus may make it easier for NHS Trusts to avoid putting scarce resources into patient blood management. Similarly, the evidence concerning point-of-care testing is muddled. Whilst there are several studies which show a benefit in terms of reduction in transfusion in cardiac surgery, the routine use of viscoelastic point-of-care testing has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes [8]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies in cardiac surgery showed that there was no difference in re-operation for bleeding, duration of stay or mortality [8]. In addition, there have been concerns about the accuracy of point-of-care tests [9], their standardisation and quality control [10], as well as the inevitable issues concerning education and training. The use of erythropoietic stimulating drugs in patient blood management is not common. These are not included on the Australian pre-operative anaemia management template [11]; however, they are recommended by the French National Authority for Health [12]. One concern has been the associated risk of thrombosis, particularly in patients with malignancy (the French guidelines specify their use in cardiac and orthopaedics only). In our opinion, the resources (in both training personnel and cost of the drugs) would be better spent concentrating on elements of patient blood management which are easier to achieve and are more likely to be adopted, such as more widespread use of oral iron and tranexamic acid. Another reason for the lack of implementation of patient blood management strategies is also financial; specifically, we must answer these questions: whose responsibility is it to pay for patient blood management and how do we prove its financial benefits? The financial outlay and resources required to set up a good patient blood management system include addressing pre-operative anaemia and the management of ongoing coagulopathies. If we would like to implement patient blood management earlier in the patient's journey, whose responsibility it is to pay for this? For example, if we would like patients to commence anaemia management when they are first referred to specialist services by their GP, this incurs an expense to primary care, yet the benefit costs (reduction in transfusion and duration of stay) are beneficial to secondary care. As such, primary care, with strained budgets, may understandably be reluctant to bear this expense. Patients presenting with bleeding or anaemia are referred rapidly to the appropriate speciality; at this point, the emphasis is on diagnosis, risk stratification and the treatment pathway. The patient may not be referred to the pre-operative anaemia service until later in the treatment pathway, sometimes a matter of days before the planned surgical date. Patients with malignancy may well be referred for pre-operative chemotherapy but again, management of anaemia is not a primary concern of this care team. Yet the NHS, as a state-funded all-encompassing healthcare system, should be in an ideal position to provide integrated holistic care with funding coming from both primary and secondary care. In 2022, the importance of pre-operative haemoglobin optimisation was recognised by NHS England, with the creation of the pre-operative anaemia Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) framework, which provided a financial incentive for improving management in this area [13]. However, it is likely that, in some instances, the costs of implementing the service would exceed the CQUIN payment. Ultimately, Trusts were allowed to choose their own CQUIN targets to achieve the financial reward. Similarly, with intra-operative cell salvage, there is no unified NHS approach to funding or provision. This is a technique which is well-established internationally, with benefits that may include the reduction in peri-operative allogeneic red cell transfusion (and thus reduced risk of transfusion reactions and errors) as well as offering red cell replacement that has better oxygen carriage and reduced risk of initiating transfusion-related immunomodulation [14, 15]. However, the lack of a unified NHS policy has meant that services have evolved locally with differing business models, relying upon budgets arising from pathology, surgery, operating theatre or anaesthesia. The financial benefits of cell salvage are seen in reductions in duration of stay and hospital readmission, and may not necessarily be of direct financial benefit to the department paying for the service. Superficially, transfusing donor blood is easier and may be cheaper than funding and supporting cell salvage for the operating theatre budget; staffing, education and equipment are all necessary commodities that an underfunded service may not be keen not to pay for. It is important to recognise that there is no requirement to collect data on cell salvage use in the UK and it is not known how much peri-operative allogeneic transfusion is avoided by cell salvage. A survey of UK practice in 2019 estimated that cell salvage provided an equivalent of 8800 units of packed red cells. However, the authors stressed the incompleteness of data with only 114 hospitals of the 225 contacted being able to provide data [16]. In comparison, the latest data (from 2014) estimated that peri-operative transfusion accounted for 15,216 units of allogeneic packed red cells in England and Wales [17]. There are no data that identifies what proportion of donor transfusion could be replaced with cell-saved blood [18]. Tranexamic acid is a low-cost, low-risk and effective intervention which has been proven to reduce blood loss in a variety of surgical and trauma situations [19, 20]. Why then do only 39% of UK centres have a policy for its use? There are several perceived barriers to the routine use of tranexamic acid. At the start of a case we often ask if the surgeons expect a blood loss of > 500 ml, yet it is well known that surgeons and anaesthetists are unreliable at estimating blood loss [21]. Should we instead define a list of procedures where we believe tranexamic acid is indicated? Another barrier is the concern about adverse effects, specifically stroke and other thrombo-embolic disease. However, there is no evidence that tranexamic acid (at an intravenous dose of 1 g for an adult) increases adverse events [22, 23]. Perhaps we should instead adopt an approach where 1 g of tranexamic acid is given to all surgical patients unless there is a known contraindication. The reduction in blood loss (even if it is not to the extent that requires transfusion) may allow a quicker recovery from surgery and reduce the risk of postoperative anaemia or requirement for transfusion. Once the reluctance to giving tranexamic acid is overcome, the literature is unclear as to the best dose to use (and what route to administer this by). A review by the Cochrane group on tranexamic acid use in hip and knee surgery suggested that a total peri-operative dose of > 3 g has the greatest effect on reduction on blood loss; the authors were unable to find any evidence of harm, although they commented that they were not able to draw definitive conclusions based on the trials included within the review [24]. The Royal College of Surgeons has recently advocated a 1 g bolus of tranexamic acid at the beginning and end of surgery, in line with the dosage regime in the POISE-3 study [25]. The dose of tranexamic acid used in the CRASH-2 study (1 g bolus followed by 1 g over 8 h) offers yet another treatment regimen [19]. In our opinion, the lack of a nationally agreed dosing regimen is contributing to the inconsistent and suboptimal use of this antifibrinolytic drug. Although tranexamic acid is an extremely cheap component of patient blood management, other modalities such as a pre-operative anaemia service or cell salvage cost time and money and require clinical and managerial investment, and ongoing support. Very commonly the investment will need to come from one service, with the benefits being achieved much later in the patient journey. Put simply, the money is invested by one department, but the benefits are seen by others. Whilst some studies have shown a financial benefit to the implementation of patient blood management, there remain other studies which do not. Key amongst these is the PREVENTT trial [7] which, for various reasons, did not show a benefit in the treatment of pre-operative anaemia [26]. However, patients in the trial who received intravenous iron were less likely to require re-admission following surgery at 8 weeks (RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.40–0.91) and 6 months (RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.58–1.04). This decreased rate of re-admission was associated with a greater increase in haemoglobin in the intervention group at 8 weeks and 6 months. In addition, there are likely to be other, more subtle benefits to treating anaemia including improvement in quality of life, readmission rates and improvements in heart failure management [27], which may not be amenable to economic analysis. Education is another challenge that impedes adoption of patient blood management. Despite the numerous studies that have shown the benefits of patient blood management [2, 3], there remain several sceptics. This includes those who perceive anaemia as a very common, but minimally significant, condition and one that can be 'fixed' with transfusion. Part of this culture is one of the ongoing dismissal of women's health issues, as anaemia is more common in women with heavy menstrual bleeding and affects several hundred million women worldwide. The failure to address this and to perceive anaemia as a variation of normal, represents a catastrophic failure of healthcare to address the needs of a significant section of the population. And whilst transfusion does increase the patient's haemoglobin, it has little (or even a negative) effect on the patient's ability to manufacture red cells. An interesting illustration of the counterproductive effect of transfusion on red blood cell manufacture has been reported by Holm et al. who showed that postpartum transfusion suppressed erythropoiesis, resulting in reduced haemoglobin when compared with those patients receiving intravenous iron [28]. We suggest that patient blood management should form part of medical school teaching and postgraduate nursing education, and that there should be awareness and an obligation at Trust level. It should remain a facet of training in surgical and anaesthetic specialities, and be considered a core skill with key importance in ensuring optimal patient care; it should not be seen as an optional extra. What does good look like for patient blood management in peri-operative care? The deficiencies in UK practice identified in the study by Warnakulasuriya et al. are critically important [5]. The reduction in bleeding associated with patient blood management, and therefore the lower demand for blood, will help to reduce alerts from critically low blood stock levels. Leadership is vital to develop a national service; Farmer et al. describe a comprehensive patient blood management programme implementation and assessment tool which includes executive leadership; administrative support; education; and engaged community stakeholders [29]. In our opinion, the improvements in UK practice must begin even before the first point of contact with secondary healthcare. Anaemia should be screened for and prevented in the community, with public health measures and education to improve diet and attention paid to chronic bleeding. At the point of contact with primary care, the patient with anaemia should have the cause identified and measures instigated to reduce ongoing blood loss and to replace the loss of haematinic factors. Primary care should have the resources to investigate and treat iron deficiency, with the feasibility of community iron hubs being considered. Surgical pathways for benign and malignant disease should have anaemia screening at the beginning of their pathways and Trusts be incentivised to support anaemia optimisation. The World Health Organization surgical checklist should pay specific attention to bleeding issues; the question should be 'is there a reason not to give tranexamic acid?'. When blood loss could be > 500 ml, cell salvage should be available, and cell saved blood should be the preferred first line red blood cell product for all patients when clinically appropriate. In addition, although the evidence for use of point-of-care testing of coagulation is incomplete, the aspiration for clinicians should be optimisation of coagulation, to avoid both coagulopathy and thrombotic phenomena. There are significant wins with patient blood management. A holistic approach to implementation can improve the health and clinical outcomes of surgical, medical and obstetric patients; reduce healthcare costs; improve patient safety; advance patient education and empowerment; and reduce the demand for allogeneic blood components and thus the national dependency on transfusion. The urgency for implementation is undeniable. SA is an Editor of Anaesthesia and has received honoraria from Haemonetics and Octapharma.

Islamic Finance Instruments and Systematic Risks: A Call for Financial Framework Reform,"This manuscript examines the contemporary practices in Islamic finance and the associated systematic risks. It critiques the current instruments of Islamic finance and the conventional financial framework within which Islamic banks function, highlighting their suboptimal nature. The discussion extends to the challenges of tenor and currency mismatches and their influence on systematic risk, as observed in the deposit banking model concerning asset-liability management. The study advocates for a direct connection between resource mobilization and lending activities, aiming to counteract the trend of Islamic finance converging with conventional finance and to prevent the recurrent financial crises attributed to the disparities between resource mobilization and bank lending. The arguments rest on the premise that the profit-loss sharing principle in Islamic finance is designed not to absolve borrowers of their obligations. Rather, it ensures that investors, as opposed to the general public, share in both the profits and the risks. Furthermore, the manuscript suggests the potential development of Shari’ah compliant capital market alternatives within an appropriate financial framework, which is currently absent. Additionally, it addresses the Shari’ah compliance concerns associated with sukuk, specifically the issues surrounding the sale and lease-back-based (bai’ al-’inah) and commodity murabaha (organized tavarruq) transactions. This paper anticipates several outcomes from the proposed measures. These include establishing a fair risk-sharing system aligned with Islamic finance principles, enhancing resistance to speculative bubbles by mitigating systemic risks in the current structure, and contributing economically to society through genuine financing models.",2025-03-17,

Generational Detectives,"Introduction This article examines American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders (2024), a four-part documentary released on Netflix. Directed by Zachary Treitz, the documentary follows young photojournalist Christian Hansen as he tries to solve the mysterious death of Danny Casolaro. In 1991, Casolaro was found deceased in a hotel room while tracking officials in the CIA and former Reagan White House. He had planned to write an explosive book about what he termed “The Octopus”, an octuplet of overlapping conspiracies that transpired in the 1980s. At the time, local officials ruled Casolaro’s death a suicide, but many suspect that someone murdered him for nearing a dangerous truth (McConnachie and Tudge 128). The series follows Christian Hansen between 2013-2024 as he traces his predecessor’s footsteps in a real-life film noir. He compiles forgotten documents, contacts old sources, and narrates his quest for a truth that has been buried for more than 30 years. However, American Conspiracy is not just about Casolaro’s death. In my view, it is also an artifact of generational conflict between the Millennials (born between 1982 and 1996) and the generations that preceded them (Traub and Donner 975). These include the Silent Generation (born before 1945) and the Baby Boomers (1946-1964; Vogels). I argue that the documentary depicts Millennials attempting to understand the world they have inherited—a world riven by neoliberal austerity (Cairns 125), the 9/11 attacks (Ng et al. 282), and the 2008 financial crisis (Barnes 34). These and other crises have led to wealth inequality and a disenchantment with democracy (Barnes 34; Bennett Inst. 2). While the series does not explicitly reference neoliberalism and democratic disenchantment, etc., it lends itself to this decoding, because it interrogates the Reagan era and foregrounds the unresolved crimes of the past, making generational conflict a key to the latent meanings of the text (Hall 507). American Conspiracy therefore cultivates suspicion of the “parent culture”, and specifically those who held power in the 1980s federal government (Clarke et al. 100). Moreover, the documentary showcases the “generational detective”, which is a temporal analogue to Fredric Jameson’s “social detective” concept (qtd. in Tait 9). Beyond asking “Was Danny murdered?”, it also asks: “What have our elders wrought?” The four-part series operates in the conspiracy theory tradition (Knight 1; Popp 256), but it also conveys the tropes of film noir (Dixon 1; Woltmann). Among the most conspicuous is the body double, which occurs when Hansen literally plays the role of Casolaro in dramatised scenes. Other noir tropes include Hansen as a lone detective consumed by an indifferent world; individuals cannot be trusted; information gathered is questionable; the narrative is convoluted; confirmed and suspected murders occur; the ending is neither happy nor satisfying; and a scam sets the story in motion, namely the theft of legal software in 1982. But it is also a true story, which places American Conspiracy into the rarer category of “documentary noir” (Carey). According to Jeffries, this genre entails the filmmaker embodying the role of investigator after authorities have proven ineffectual in the face of crime (301). In the following section, I will briefly outline the documentary narrative and then explain the method used to analyse the text. The third section relates the findings, which hinge on American Conspiracy serving a dual role as documentary noir and a generational detective story. The final section links this series to a “media subculture” of conspiracy theorists active in YouTube videos, podcasts, and social-media threads (Higdon and Lyons 40). This group is a “counterpublic” that espouses left-wing conspiracism (Sienkiewicz and Jaramillo 268) – an ideology otherwise known as “parapolitics” (Jimmy Falun Gong). Studying this subculture is important, because it suggests that conspiracy theory becomes a popular epistemology at a time when disillusionment with politics is at its highest among younger adults (Bennett Inst. 1). When questions are left unanswered from the past, and noir-like endings remain unsatisfying to the generational detective, suspicious media texts emerge in the culture and nourish conspiracy theories for another generation. From the Shadowy Reagan Era to Streaming Detective Story American Conspiracy comprises four episodes. It is disjointed and scattered in presentation, though this tracks with its attention to a convoluted story. As Dan Rather states in an old newscast repurposed for Episode 1 (“The End”), it is a “complex and confusing, still developing case” (00:39:11). It begins in the early 1980s, when a computer company, Inslaw, develops software for the criminal justice system. This PROMIS software could find similarities in criminal cases tried across the country, which would help the government build cases against career criminals. Inslaw soon sold PROMIS to the US Department of Justice (DOJ). Afterwards, however, the DOJ cut off payments, costing Inslaw millions of dollars. Casolaro caught wind of the PROMIS affair and began investigating the story. Episode 2 reveals that the DOJ stole PROMIS in 1982 for the benefit of a Reagan associate named Earl Brian. Allegedly, Brian helped transfer $40 million to Iran in 1980. The funds came with the demand to detain 52 American hostages until after the presidential election, thus compounding a hostage debacle that made incumbent Democrat, Jimmy Carter, appear weak. After Reagan won the 1980 election, Brian was supposedly repaid for his “October Surprise” role by gaining access to PROMIS. The October Surprise is only one arm of the Octopus, but there is not enough space to explain the other seven. In fact, even the documentary ignores most of the Octopus’s anatomy, focussing on three limbs only: the Inslaw case, the October Surprise, and the strange activity that took place on the Cabazon Reservation in Indio, California. The remaining arms of the Octopus are an Australian bank called Nugan Hand, the 1980s Savings and Loans scandal, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), the Iran-Contra affair, and the covert adventures of two CIA agents: Frank Terpil and Edwin P. Wilson. A mysterious figure involved in the intrigue is Michael Riconoscuito, who claims to have tampered with the PROMIS software in the 1980s to turn it into an espionage tool. Riconoscuito speaks of the convoluted story in Episode 3 (“The Game”), saying: “I’ve got a matrix-like analysis [of the case, but] it would take days to go through it” (00:14:35). At another point, an exasperated Hansen says to the camera: “It never ends! It never ends” (00:23:47). As in film noir, Hansen and Casolaro embody the “hard-boiled detectives unravelling labyrinthian mysteries” (Dixon 1). As in conspiracy theory, the resolution is endlessly deferred (Fenster xvii); Hansen is never able to prove that someone murdered Casolaro, and Casolaro was unable to link all the conspirators in his lifetime. Method Netflix categorises American Conspiracy as “True Crime”, which Punnett defines as “nonfiction narratives of criminal events that actually happened” (qtd. in Maher and Cake 97). This may be sensible enough, especially given the genre’s “widespread popularity amongst subscribers of streaming services” (100). I argue that the series is too connotative to be tidily contained this way, however. I believe American Conspiracy addresses a larger question without realising it, which I expose through a “symptomatic” reading of the series (Althusser and Balibar 28). Texts are not only polysemic, but they include unconscious claims and silences that symptomatic readings can identify. A similar approach is Ricouer’s “hermeneutics of suspicion, [which] assumes that the manifest or surface meaning of a text is a veil that masks its true agenda” (Culver and Vuleta 11). To interpret the documentary, I draw on semiotic analysis (Barthes ix; Brown 113; Dunleavy 167). Attributed to such scholars as Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1931) and Roland Barthes (1915-1960), this method works well for the series, because it allows me to single out visual signifiers on the screen. I next determine the “underlying meaning[s]” the signifiers have for the documentary as a whole (Titscher et al. 126). Semiotics can be used in conjunction with the broader method of textual analysis, which is useful for interpreting Hansen’s statements. Textual analysis traces back to such academic traditions as the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in the 1960s (Dworkin 121). The method looks for “underlying ideological and cultural assumptions of a text” (Arya 173), or what Phillipov calls finding “a vocabulary to describe the elusive” (221). This is my general aim when interpreting American Conspiracy as a case study of both documentary noir and generational conflict. The Semiotics of Conspiracy Theory, Young Adulthood, and Media Technology Jameson argued that the conspiracy text was both a detective story and an “unconscious, collective effort at trying to figure out where we are and what … forces confront us” (qtd. in Tait 2). I agree with this assessment and claim that American Conspiracy adds an additional generational layer. The series is an expression of Millennial investigation from an age cohort who grew up in the triple shadow of neoliberalism, the War on Terror, and the 2008 financial crisis. The “problematic” of the text, or that which is answered without the producers’ acknowledgment, is that Millennials wish to know what treacherous forces were afoot before them (Storey 57). American Conspiracy is an unconscious prying open of the adult generations’ floorboards to search for the proverbial bodies. Noir provides a useful lens to explain what is going on. Generational detectives navigate an alienating world due to neoliberal precarity, and they face constant uncertainty in the form of conspiracy theories that never seem to resolve. In other words, noir is spilling over into their real lives (Dixon 153). A prominent signifier in the series is geographic sprawl, which suggests that the conspiracy is as wide as the country. Casolaro lived in Fairfax, Virginia, and he died in West Virginia. The PROMIS affair took place in Washington DC, and Riconosciuto hid evidence in the Pacific Northwest. Casolaro went to New York City to pitch his book, and a related murder took place in San Francisco. The sprawl accords with Jameson, who argues that films such as The Parallax View depict the detective “mapping the … social totality” (Tait 43). He traces this trope back to Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest, “which propels us from one empty hotel room to another across continental North America” (Jameson 122). This is an overlap between conspiracy and noir. As Dixon writes, “noir is a state of paranoia, a zone in which nothing seems stable … and [a] world [that] is a constant battleground” (viii). In Episode 4 (“The Monster”), Hansen questions how he can return to his normal life after peering into this abyssal network of corruption and murder. Jameson likens this phenomenon to a peek below the surface – a conceit that stretches from Dante’s trek through the underworld to Marx’s exposure of “the hidden abode of production” (176). But instead of infiltrating Hell or the “Satanic mills” of industrial England, Hansen steps into a Reagan-era scandal (Linebaugh and Rediker 250). Jameson further states that the “promise of a deeper inside view is the hermeneutic content of the conspiracy thriller” (123). Incidentally, Freud and Marx were graduates of the “school of suspicion”, according to Paul Ricoeur (Felski). This is due to each thinker’s interest in uncovering “self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible … truths” (Felski). Marx exposed the commodity fetish, and Freud the subconscious desire. A textual analysis shows how this applies to American Conspiracy as well. Hansen admits in Episode 4 that the decade-long investigation was transformative, saying: “it changed me. And it changed the way I think about reality … and think about history … . This is the surface, but what’s going on in the shadows” (00:46:54). Hansen is awakening to truths concealed by the parent generation. Young adulthood is another prominent signifier in the documentary. When Hansen first learns about Casolaro in 2013, he is 25 years old. While the director (Treitz) does not say, he appears to be the same age. The two are also younger than the participants in the on-camera interviews. Markers of youth often surround Hansen, including photos from what appears to be college get-togethers, as well as footage of him skateboarding down the street (Atencio et al. 154). A scene in Episode 4 shows a young Hansen explaining the case and repeatedly saying “like” in between sentences – another giveaway of youth (Hill). Relatedly, Hansen has embraced digital media technology in his quest. The opening and closing scenes of Episode 1 depict a conversation through an iPhone. An external hard drive appears on a desk, an iMac computer looms in the background, and hi-tech video cameras and production equipment drift into scenes. The semiotic reading of this technology overlaps with the semiotics of young adulthood. This is because young people have especially embraced digital media in a way the Baby Boomers did not (Prensky 1). As Jenkins et al. claim, young people “have been the lead adopters of mobile, social, and gaming media” (viii). Vogels finds that 93% of Millennials own smartphones, compared to 68% of Boomers and 40% of Silents. Roughly 100% of Millennials use the Internet, and 86% use social media. Additionally, Millennials believe the Internet to be a benefit to society more than any preceding generation. Hansen and Treitz take this youth-coded gadgetry straight into the Casolaro case, thereby linking the concepts of suspicion, youth, and technology in the film. The documentary synthesises new media technologies with film-noir tropes of the 1940s and 50s, with Treitz even citing Hitchcock as an inspiration for his work (McGovern). While Hitchcock may be more of a noir “stylist” than a founding noir director, he worked in the genre in such 1950s classics as Rear Window and Vertigo (Olsen). Hitchcock used “intentionally mechanical” camerawork to bring his vision to life, with the camera circling actors and following them down flights of stairs, among other motions (Olsen). In American Conspiracy, media technology also takes on a conspicuous role: Hansen’s iPhone acts a key to the intelligence underworld; a covert camera shows the filmmakers visiting a home; and a handheld camera follows Hansen through a police station. As the two Millennials set off into the backwaters of Reagan-era scandal, they arrive on doorsteps of elderly couples. They situate greying interviewees before their own cameras. A semiotic reading suggests this is a generational autopsy of the 1980s, the era in which the filmmakers (and other Millennials) were born. Conclusion: The Persistence of Conspiracy In this concluding section, I connect American Conspiracy to a media subculture that uses conspiracy theories to excavate the origins of our political conjuncture. This subculture is sometimes known as the “para-political” left, which shares content on digital platforms and social media. It is loosely confederated, critical of capitalism, and (at times) internally combative. Podcasts in this milieu include American Exception (2021), Death Is Just around the Corner (2018), Ghost Stories for the End of the World (2020), Media Roots Radio (2010), ParaPower Mapping (2023), Programmed to Chill (2021), Subliminal Jihad (2020), and True Anon (2019). In February 2024, Hansen and Treitz appeared on True Anon, one of the few artifacts from the subculture to have attracted scholarly attention (Chase 214). Para-political podcasts share similarities with true-crime content creators. For instance, the conspiratorial hosts interact with fans and followers on social media, as true-crime podcasters do (Boling and Hull 97). True-crime hosts create a “discourse community”, which becomes recognisable to followers who use the same terms and phrases (van Driel 150). Whereas a true-crime fan might understand an in-joke or “specific lexis” (164), para-political enthusiasts might use the term “noided” – a play on the word “paranoid”. Both podcasting genres also present evidence to the audience (Morton 240), which “hails” listeners as members of a jury or investigative panel (Althusser 108). But on the other hand, the para-political subculture, to which Hansen and Treitz are marginally connected, is different. Mostly young to middle-aged men seem to make up its opinion leaders, which might translate to a majority-men listenership. This would clash with the majority-women consumers of true-crime fare (Boling and Hull 106). I make this connection between American Conspiracy and the para-political subculture because both expose aspects of the parent culture. The podcasts discuss topics such as the CIA and the JFK and RFK assassinations. They are similar to past noir authors who, for example, used literature and film to unmask that “bright, guilty place” of Los Angeles in the mid-twentieth century (Davis 18) and evince a point that Kellner makes about the hit TV show, The X-Files, which he sees as an artifact of “generational war” (226). Kellner argues that the cohort of its creator, Chris Carter, has an “unhealed wound” from the Vietnam War, adding that it “keeps festering and generating tales to capture its hideousness and horrors” (216). He goes on to say that The X-Files depicts the “older generation [as] tremendously compromised and arguably corrupt, especially those in the military, political, and corporate bureaucracies” (226). It is up to the younger heroes to restore the moral order. While Chris Carter may no longer be doing this today, the para-political left carries the torch, using conspiracy theories to medicate their own “unhealed wound”. Shareable digital media and conspiracy theories have become fronts in a generational conflict. With different levels of political radicalism, suspicious Millennials negotiate neoliberalism and unresponsive government – a real-life film noir of “doubt and fear and uncertainty” (Dixon 1). They embody the earliest origins of noir, forged in the “depressingly stark 1930s … [when] even the seemingly protected middle classes were facing economic insecurity” (Palmer 389). Like those noir writers, they too expose “capitalism’s unsavoury undercurrents” (390). This media subculture likely embraces conspiracy theory as it does because traditional political processes have left them feeling alienated. Because political and economic problems persist, particularly for young adults in America, the age-old practice of conspiracy theorising will also persist. As Fiske and others have pointed out, marginalisation has long been the crucible for conspiratorial belief (192). Since the wound has not yet healed for the generational detectives, conspiracism will remain an attractive panacea.

Crowdfunding Amidst FinTech Winter: Complement or Substitute?,"This study examines the transformative potential of FinTech, particularly crowdfunding, in the context of traditional financial systems amidst the FinTech market downturn (‘Winter’) of 2022. We address a fundamental question: Does crowdfunding represent a viable alternative to conventional finance, or does it merely function as an extension of existing financial infrastructure? To investigate this relationship empirically, we developed a proprietary crowdfunding index and employed Interconnectedness Index methodology to compare the spillover effects of crowdfunding and traditional financial systems with common economic factors such as interest rates, USD index, economic uncertainty, cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), as well as commodities (gold and oil). Despite crowdfunding’s remarkable growth trajectory over the past decade, our empirical evidence indicates that it has not yet emerged as a viable substitute for conventional financial mechanisms. These findings carry substantial implications for regulatory frameworks, industry stakeholders, and academic discourse, contributing to the broader understanding of FinTech’s disruptive capacity within the financial ecosystem.",2025-03-14,
Trends in Atmospheric Emissions in Central Asian Countries Since 1990 in the Context of Regional Development,"In Central Asian countries (CACs) atmosphere pollution is increasing due to population growth, economic growth, agricultural development, energy consumption and climate change. The countries of region developed climate change adaptation strategies - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At the same time, regional integration, which should be a necessary condition for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the solving of general environmental problems, is not involved. This article shows the importance of a comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) and non-greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere for the entire Central Asian region as a single ecosystem. The energy intensity of national economies structure was chosen as the main factor determining the level of pollution. The analysis shows that over the past 30 years, the main part of the commodity exports (73.6 - 81.4%) of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan has been fossil natural resources. There is a strong economic dependence on coal and other types of fuel, which leads to the atmospheric emissions. The analysis shows that limited financial resources, lack of effective systemic monitoring and control of air quality that meets modern international requirements and standards, leads to absence of tangible changes in practice yet. Over 30 years in CACs, the share of CO2 emissions associated with the fossil fuels combustion has not decreased and amounts to 78%. The key mechanisms for reducing atmospheric emissions are significantly increase investments in the transformation of the economies in the context of regional development, interstate cooperation, the introduction of environmental norms, standards harmonized with world ones, green technologies based on alternative energy, sustainable transport and logistics infrastructure.",2025-03-13,

"Constrained optimization: evaluating possible packages of community health interventions with competing resource requirements in Galmudug, Somalia","Abstract Investment in Community Health Worker (CHW) programs has allowed health systems to reach previously underserved rural and remote populations. As a result, CHWs are often burdened with responsibilities to deliver large packages of services, at times without sufficient human, financial, or health resources. To design a community-level program that saves maternal and newborn lives while operating within resource limitations, we used constrained optimization (a mathematical process for finding the solution to a stated objective while accounting for listed requirements) to construct a model for select villages in Galmudug State, Somalia. After establishing the resource requirements for delivering 25 evidence-based maternal and neonatal interventions, we used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) and optimization techniques to determine the package of care that leads to the most projected lives saved. With a cadre of 1,450 Female Health Workers and a budget of $435,000 for maternal and neonatal health commodities and programming over one year, we calculated that the optimized set of interventions for Galmudug could avert 15% of the 4,132 projected maternal and neonatal deaths in 2024. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to show how the optimal combination of interventions and the number of lives saved change as the resource levels change. The model provides practitioners with a new tool and accompanying approach to evaluate possible packages of community health interventions with competing resource requirements.",2025-03-11,
"Report of the Board of Directors to the Congress of Colombia, February 2025","In 2024, the macroeconomic adjustment process continued, characterized by a sustained reduction in inflation that began in 2023 and a decline in the current account deficit of the balance of payments. This adjustment took place in the context of a contractionary monetary policy, with a gradual reduction in the monetary policy interest rate. GDP grew by 1.7%, driven by investment and consumption, while employment increased by 2.2%. Foreign reserves remained at adequate levels, and Banco de la República recorded a profit of COP 10,041 billion, benefiting from the returns on foreign reserves. Macroeconomic environment The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank estimate that the global economy grew by 3.2% in 2024, a rate similar to that observed in 2023 (3.3%). This occurred in a context of moderating inflation and declining monetary policy interest rates in most countries. Global inflation moderated over the course of 2024. However, inflation rebounded toward the end of the year in some advanced economies, mainly due to rising energy costs. In Latin America, inflation trends were mixed. While some economies experienced sustained price stability, in most cases, inflation remained above the targets set by their respective central banks. Monetary policy interest rates in most Latin American economies continued to decline, reflecting a moderation in inflation and inflation expectations. However, some countries in the region recently raised interest rates in response to renewed inflationary pressures. Oil production increased in 2024, leading to a 3% decrease in oil prices, with Brent crude averaging around USD 80 per barrel. However, geopolitical tensions prevented a more pronounced decline. The U.S. dollar appreciated against most currencies, driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would implement more gradual policy rate cuts. In 2025, global economic growth is projected to be similar to that of 2024, supported by declining inflation, wage recovery, sustained employment growth, and a less restrictive monetary policy stance. However, geopolitical tensions and U.S. trade policies introduce uncertainty. More gradual reductions in the Fed’s interest rate are expected, with the possibility of pauses if inflationary pressures resurface. In Latin America, central banks are expected to continue cutting interest rates, although monetary policy may remain contractionary where inflation has not yet reached target levels. Domestic economic activity Colombia’s GDP grew by 1.7% in 2024, reflecting a moderate recovery compared to the previous year. This occurred in an environment of lower interest rates, improved domestic demand, and an increase in remittances and exports. Private consumption and fixed capital investment—particularly in infrastructure projects such as the Bogotá metro—contributed to economic growth. However, investment in housing declined. Agricultural and services sectors led economic growth, while mining and manufacturing contracted. The loan portfolio experienced low nominal growth, though some segments showed signs of recovery toward the end of the year. For 2025, economic activity is expected to continue recovering, approaching its productive capacity and aligning with the convergence of inflation toward its target. Employment Employment grew by 2.2% in 2024, resulting in the creation of 508,000 jobs. This expansion was driven by rural areas, where employment increased by 3.2%, surpassing the 1.4% growth in urban areas. The commerce, accommodation, manufacturing, public administration, health, and education sectors were the primary contributors to job creation. Wage employment grew by 2.7%, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, while non-wage employment increased by 1.8%, leading to a decline in informality to 55.6%. The national unemployment rate fell by 0.6 percentage points, reaching 9.7%, with a more pronounced reduction in rural areas. For 2025, the unemployment rate is expected to remain stable, supported by a positive economic outlook. Inflation and Monetary Policy Headline inflation in Colombia fell significantly from 9.3% in 2023 to 5.2% in 2024, primarily due to a restrictive monetary policy that moderated domestic demand and contributed to a reduction in the current account deficit. Core inflation (excluding food and regulated products) declined from 8.4% to 5.2%, reflecting the effectiveness of contractionary monetary policy. Inflation of goods dropped sharply, from 7.1% to 0.6%, due in part to the resolution of logistical disruptions and the appreciation of the peso. In contrast, services inflation declined more moderately, from 9% to 7%, influenced by indexation to past inflation and the increase in the minimum wage. Prices of food decreased from 5.0% to 3.3%, driven by lower pressures on processed food prices, benefiting from reduced costs of imported raw materials and a favorable exchange rate. Prices of regulated items dropped to 7.3%, following smaller adjustments in gasoline prices (after the required increases in 2023) and lower electricity and public service tariff increases, except for gas prices, which continued to rise. Inflation is expected to continue converging toward the 3% target in 2025, with headline inflation projected to close the year at around 4.1%, continuing its downward path into 2026. However, new risks have emerged, including a recent rise in producer costs, a significant increase in the minimum wage, and a rebound in inflation expectations. Balance of payments Colombia’s current account deficit narrowed to 1.7% of GDP between January and September 2024, down from 2.5% in the same period in 2023. This improvement was driven by higher remittance inflows, an improved services trade balance, and lower factor income outflows. Remittances reached a record USD 11,848 million, with the United States and Spain as the main sources of these inflows. A decline in the profits of foreign direct investment (FDI) companies, particularly in the oil and coal sectors, also contributed to reducing external imbalances. The trade deficit widened due to a greater imbalance in the trade of goods within a context of lower commodity prices. However, this was partially offset by strong agricultural and industrial exports. Additionally, the good performance of service exports, supported by higher international tourist arrivals, helped contain a larger trade imbalance. The financial account recorded net capital inflows equivalent to 1.1% of GDP, lower than the 2.5% recorded in 2023, primarily due to a decline in foreign direct investment in mining, transportation, and oil. This was partially offset by growth in financial and business services investment. The current account deficit is estimated to have closed 2024 at 1.8% of GDP, with a projected widening to 2.5% in 2025, in line with higher expected economic growth and stronger domestic demand. Public finances According to preliminary figures from the 2025 Financial Plan (PF-25) presented by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP), Colombia’s General Government deficit reached 4.8% of GDP in 2024, marking a 2.1 percentage-point increase compared to 2023. This deterioration was mainly driven by a worsening in the balances of the Central National Government (GNC) (2.6 pp) and the Social Security subsector (0.4 pp), partially offset by a 0.8 pp improvement in Regional and Local Government balances. The reduction in the deficit position of the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund (FEPC for its acronym in Spanish) was notable, following gasoline price adjustments, which closed the gap between the reference price and local market prices. However, fiscal pressures persist due to ongoing subsidies for ACPM (diesel fuel). The total and primary deficits of the Central Government stood at 6.8% and 2.4% of GDP, respectively, driven by a decline in tax revenue—particularly from income and external taxes—alongside increased government spending. The net debt of the Central Government increased to 60% of GDP, exceeding previous forecasts. For 2025, a total and primary deficit of 5.1% and 0.2% of GDP is projected, with tax revenue expected to grow by 22.6%. Compliance with the fiscal rule and the stabilization of public finances will be critical in 2025, given the potential impact of fiscal slippage on the country’s risk premiums. Failure to meet fiscal targets could raise interest rates for both the Government and the broader economy. Maintaining credibility in fiscal policy will be key to preventing macroeconomic adjustments from exerting additional pressure on interest rates. International Reserves As of December 31, 2024, Colombia’s net international reserves stood at USD 62,481 million, reflecting an increase of USD 2,873 million during the year. This growth was primarily driven by returns on reserves, which reached 3.65%, benefiting from higher global interest rates, and Banco de la República's reserve accumulation program, which added USD 1,479.4 million to reserves. According to the IMF’s reserve adequacy methodology, Colombia maintains a reserve ratio of 1.29. This falls within the adequate range (1.0 – 1.5), indicating that Colombia’s reserves are sufficient to withstand extreme external shocks and balance of payments risks. Profits obtained by Banco de la República The Bank's profits reached a record COP 10,041 billion in 2024, resulting from revenues of COP 13,948 billion and expenses of COP 3,907 billion. Profits increased by COP 815 billion compared to 2023, primarily due to lower expenses, although partially offset by a decline in revenues. For 2025, profits are projected at COP 10,512 billion, supported by the high expected profitability of foreign reserves. However, this projection is subject to uncertainty related to reserve performance and monetary base growth.",2025-03-10,
Bitcoin Volatility Forecasting Based on Time Series Decomposition and Deep Learning Model,"In recent years, various digital currencies have emerged, among which Bitcoin has been widely accepted as an alternative to sovereign currencies for commodity trading. However, the dramatic volatility of bitcoin prices can pose a risk to global financial markets. In this paper, we firstly construct a more comprehensive forecasting index system from seven aspects, and then construct a VMD-GRU model. This model uses the variational modal decomposition (VMD) to decompose the time series into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and use gated recurrent unit (GRU) to forecast different IMFs. This paper also compares the forecast results with classical machine learning models and deep learning models, and the results show that the forecast accuracy of the VMD-GRU model is more than 16% better than other models.",2025-03-07,
Speculation and Scientific Method: Thomas Harriot’s Virginia IPO,"Abstract This article proposes that Thomas Harriot’s Briefe and True Report of 1588 is the first initial public offering (IPO) in history and that understanding it as such provides new insight into how plantation capitalism and scientific method were conceptualized in a mutually constitutive Anglo-American discourse. First, the author traces how the practical exigencies posed by the anomalous form of English New World colonization that Walter Ralegh pursued, commodity plantation by private enterprise, provoked a conceptual and discursive shift in how knowledge was defined and instrumentalized. Next, she reads Harriot’s Report to show that the IPO itself constitutes an episteme. To rationalize an enormously speculative venture, Harriot isolates and presents verifiable, reproducible data that will allow prospective investors to gauge the likelihood of financial return—he assumes a recognizable empirical method. But because the enterprise Harriot promotes is predicated on territorial dispossession of Indigenous people, the author next shows that he conceived of instrumentalized knowledge in his formative text not only as a tool but also as a weapon. She closes with a brief consideration of how Francis Bacon, himself deeply involved in Virginia plantations by 1620, renders Harriot’s intervention into philosophy, in his famous pronouncement in the New Organon that “knowledge and power . . . really come to the same thing.”",2025-03-07,
A Theoretical Review for Assessing the Determinants and Challenges of Agri-Startups With Reference to Appropriate Technology in India,"This chapter highlights the theoretical review for assessing the determinants and challenges of agri-startups in India as per previous literature. The overview of 100 agri-startups promoted by incubators is also emphasized in this chapter. Thereupon it explores the current challenges and development of Agri-startups in India. Finally, it separates the available agricultural technologies as per their usages and practicability. It appealed that appropriate technology, technological advancement, and innovation are beneficial to increase the development of agri-startups. The agri-startups and agri-business are facing multiple issues like low digital adoption rate, poor innovation, financial inaccessibility, low venture fund, and inappropriate marketing and high price variation of agricultural commodities in India. Farmers should also collaborate with agri-tech industries, research organizations, and private investors to increase agri-startups in India.",2025-03-07,
Maximum Trimmed Likelihood Estimation for Discrete Multivariate Vasicek Processes,"The multivariate Vasicek model is commonly used to capture mean-reverting dynamics typical for short rates, asset price stochastic log-volatilities, etc. Reparametrizing the discretized problem as a VAR(1) model, the parameters are oftentimes estimated using the multivariate least squares (MLS) method, which can be susceptible to outliers. To account for potential model violations, a maximum trimmed likelihood estimation (MTLE) approach is utilized to derive a system of nonlinear estimating equations, and an iterative procedure is developed to solve the latter. In addition to robustness, our new technique allows for reliable recovery of the long-term mean, unlike existing methodologies. A set of simulation studies across multiple dimensions, sample sizes and robustness configurations are performed. MTLE outcomes are compared to those of multivariate least trimmed squares (MLTS), MLE and MLS. Empirical results suggest that MTLE not only maintains good relative efficiency for uncontaminated data but significantly improves overall estimation quality in the presence of data irregularities. Additionally, real data examples containing daily log-volatilities of six common assets (commodities and currencies) and US/Euro short rates are also analyzed. The results indicate that MTLE provides an attractive instrument for interest rate forecasting, stochastic volatility modeling, risk management and other applications requiring statistical robustness in complex economic and financial environments.",2025-03-06,
Time-Varying Market Efficiency: A Focus on Crude Oil and Commodity Dynamics,"This study investigated market efficiency across 20 major commodity assets, including crude oil, utilizing fractal analysis. Additionally, a rolling window approach was employed to capture the time-varying nature of efficiency in these markets. A Granger causality test was applied to assess the influence of crude oil on other commodities. Key findings revealed significant inefficiencies in RBOB(Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenated Blending) Gasoline, Palladium, and Brent Crude Oil, largely driven by geopolitical risks that exacerbated supply–demand imbalances. By contrast, Copper, Kansas Wheat, and Soybeans exhibited greater efficiency because of their stable market dynamics. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the time-varying nature of efficiency, with short-term volatility causing price fluctuations. Geopolitical events such as the Russia–Ukraine War exposed some commodities to shocks, while others remained resilient. Brent Crude Oil was a key driver of market inefficiency. Our findings align with Fractal Fractional (FF) concepts. The MF-DFA method revealed self-similarity in market prices, while inefficient markets exhibited long-memory effects, challenging the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Additionally, rolling window analysis captured evolving market efficiency, influenced by external shocks, reinforcing the relevance of fractal fractional models in financial analysis. Furthermore, these findings can help traders, policymakers, and researchers, by highlighting Brent Crude Oil as a key market indicator and emphasizing the need for risk management and regulatory measures.",2025-03-06,

ADVANCING VOLATILITY FORECASTING: A GARCH-BASED APPROACH FOR FINANCIAL MARKET PREDICTIONS,"The main reasons for modeling and predicting volatility with GARCH models are the capturing of time-varying volatility in financial time series like returns on stocks, foreign currency prices, and commodity prices, and their prediction. There are periods of high volatility as well as low volatility which are not constant across different time periods in a financial market. Such dynamic behaviour can be quantified using GARCH models by accounting for the fact that large price movements are typically followed by further large movements of either direction, while small movements follow small ones. In this regard, GARCH models are critical in the risk management, option pricing, portfolio optimization, and financial decision-making contexts. They help practitioners and researchers to make better predictions for future market conditions, appraise possible risks, and design strategies to hedge adverse movements in the market more efficiently.",2025-03-05,
Challenges and opportunities when assessing exposure of financial investments to ecosystem regime shifts,"Financial investments will be affected by ecological regime shifts through the loss of natural resources underpinning dependencies of most economic sectors. We suggest one possible pathway to link industry and products to the likelihood of ecological regime shifts. The challenges and opportunities are discussed at each step, including datasets, methods and metrics. To this end, we identify recent large-scale, state-of-the-art literature that can link land-based company activities to regime shifts. The estimation of investment exposure to regime shifts is possible, but higher resolution in company trade data as well as spatially-explicit datasets of commodity production are needed to improve estimations. This will require coordinated effort from the scientific community, businesses, and the policy sector.",2025-03-05,
Trends in Atmospheric Emissions in Central Asian Countries Since 1990 in the Context of Regional Development,"In Central Asian countries (CACs) atmosphere pollution is increasing due to population growth, economic growth, agricultural development, energy consumption and climate change. The countries of region developed climate change adaptation strategies - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At the same time, regional integration, which should be a necessary condition for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the solving of general environmental problems, is not involved. This article shows the importance of a comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) and non-greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere for the entire Central Asian region as a single ecosystem. The energy intensity of national economies structure was chosen as the main factor determining the level of pollution. The analysis shows that over the past 30 years, the main part of the commodity exports (73.6 - 81.4%) of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan has been fossil natural resources. There is a strong economic dependence on coal and other types of fuel, which leads to the atmospheric emissions. The analysis shows that limited financial resources, lack of effective systemic monitoring and control of air quality that meets modern international requirements and standards, leads to absence of tangible changes in practice yet. Over 30 years in CACs, the share of CO2 emissions associated with the fossil fuels combustion has not decreased and amounts to 78%. The key mechanisms for reducing atmospheric emissions are significantly increase investments in the transformation of the economies in the context of regional development, interstate cooperation, the introduction of environmental norms, standards harmonized with world ones, green technologies based on alternative energy, sustainable transport and logistics infrastructure.",2025-03-04,
An international resource-based currency. The history of an idea shared by economists of different schools,"The fragmentation of international financial systems, the reshaping of the global economy, and the scramble for resources, stand acutely the question of international payments and money. Modern technologies make possible to organize international currency based on commodities/resources, within a certain group of countries, a regional bloc (BRICS, Africa, Gulf region, etc.), and significantly reduce the transaction costs of maintaining the system. The spread of this idea leads us to return to its intellectual history. In this paper, we outline the main point of the debates in the past, including the positions of the leading economists of different schools who have supported the idea of resource based international currency, such as Jevons, Fisher, Hayek, Friedman, Keynes, Tinbergen, Kaldor, Cooper, Yeager, several French politicians and scholars (such as the PM Pierre Mendes France, Jean de Larentaye, Gabriel Ardant), etc. Special attention is paid to the unknown names in the discussions, and indeed, the fathers of the idea — to Benjamin and Frank Graham, and the Dutchman Jan Goudriaan. An attempt is made to explain this form of consensus on international monetary substantialism.",2025-03-02,
"Factors influencing farmers’ decision to delay selling coffee bean: A study in Dak Ha district, Kon Tum province, Vietnam","Abstract Coffee is a major export commodity for Vietnam, consistently ranking among the country’s top exports. However, price volatility, largely driven by the surge in supply during harvest seasons, complicates income estimation for farmers and hinders investment decisions in coffee production. This paper examines the determinants influencing farmers’ decisions to postpone the sale of their coffee beans in Dak Ha district, Kon Tum province, Vietnam. A total of 122 farmers were interviewed in April 2024 through a structured questionnaire, selected via a convenience sampling method. Binary logistic regression was employed to estimate the factors affecting the decision to delay sales. Descriptive statistics indicate that 40.2% of farmers choose to delay selling their coffee beans. The financial benefits of postponing sales are tied to the price differential between the harvest and sale periods. However, farmers face challenges such as insufficient production capital and financial constraints for household expenditures during the postponement period. Furthermore, the study identifies several key factors influencing these decisions, including the number of dependents in the household, coffee production volume, contract agreements, and storage facilities. These findings underscore the complex interplay of economic, social, and logistical factors that shape farmers’ sales strategies in the coffee sector.",2025-03-01,
Features of forced execution of agrarian notes,"The article is devoted to the analysis of legal regulation and practical aspects of enforcing agrarian notes as a new financial instrument introduced to support the financing of agricultural production. An agrarian note is defined as a non-issuable security that ensures the debtor’s unconditional obligation to deliver agricultural products or pay monetary funds to the creditor in accordance with the terms specified in the document. The article provides a detailed examination of the legal nature of agrarian notes, their differences from agrarian receipts, and outlines the advantages of implementing this instrument into Ukraine’s financial system. Particular attention is paid to analyzing the novelties introduced by the Law of Ukraine «On Agrarian Notes», which comes into effect on January 1, 2025, and their impact on ensuring effective enforcement proceedings. The mechanisms of compulsory enforcement of agrarian notes are explored, including execution based on court decisions, decisions of international commercial arbitration, arbitral tribunals, or special extracts from the Agrarian Notes Register. The role of collateral as a primary means of securing obligations is highlighted, including innovative approaches such as the use of livestock or animal-derived products as collateral. Issues related to the enforcement of claims on agricultural products as the subject of collateral are analyzed, alongside the potential for using digital technologies to enhance transparency and efficiency in these procedures. The article also evaluates regulatory restrictions concerning the impossibility of enforcing claims on agricultural land owned by the debtor. A special emphasis is placed on examining the differences between financial and commodity agrarian notes, focusing on their enforcement procedures and legal implications for the parties involved. Problematic aspects of executing notarial writs on grain storage facilities and other contentious issues arising in the implementation of this instrument are investigated. The author concludes that further legislative improvements are necessary to enhance the effectiveness of agrarian note enforcement and ensure consistency in the legal regulation of this instrument with other normative acts governing enforcement proceedings. The proposals outlined in the article aim to create favorable conditions for attracting investments in agriculture and developing innovative financial mechanisms.",2025-03-01,
An Adaptive Sharpe Ratio-Based Temporal Fusion Transformer for Financial Forecasting,"Financial time series forecasting plays a critical role in investment decision-making, risk management, and portfolio optimization. Traditional forecasting models, including statistical approaches and deep learning-based architectures, often focus on maximizing predictive accuracy but fail to incorporate dynamic risk-adjusted performance metrics. The Sharpe ratio, a widely used measure of risk-adjusted return, is typically applied post-forecasting, limiting its potential to guide predictive models during training. To address this limitation, this study proposes an adaptive Sharpe ratio-based temporal fusion transformer (AS-TFT) that integrates risk-aware forecasting mechanisms to optimize financial predictions while considering return volatility. Experimental evaluations on stock indices, cryptocurrency prices, and commodity markets demonstrate that the AS-TFT outperforms conventional forecasting methods in terms of both predictive accuracy and portfolio returns. The results highlight the importance of integrating risk-adjusted financial performance metrics within deep learning-based forecasting architectures, offering a practical and scalable solution for financial decision-making.",2025-03-01,
Corporate Biodiversity and Water Impact and Risk: Seven Key Principles for Leveraging Insights From Satellite Remote Sensing,"Abstract Amid unprecedented biodiversity loss and water scarcity, calls for corporate responsibility are becoming louder and have led to emerging non‐financial disclosure frameworks with demanding data needs. While the role of satellite remote sensing (RS) is highly anticipated to address data needs and boost transparency, critical thought on what is feasible and how to strategically integrate its insights for ambitious corporate biodiversity and water disclosure is lagging behind. To address this, we propose applying a systems perspective to represent the complex, multi‐scale interactions between biodiversity, water systems, and corporate operations, and to guide how to integrate RS contributions to analyze the full spectrum of impacts and risks—ranging from direct and concurrent to cascading, cumulative, and emergent. We highlight seven guiding (non‐exhaustive) principles for leveraging satellite RS data to assess corporate biodiversity and water impacts and risks. This process requires an effective system boundary (1) set spatially, temporally, and process‐wise. Within which, biodiversity and water's multi‐dimensionality (2) needs to be addressed to monitor the spatio‐temporal dynamics (3) that characterize ecosystem responses. To attribute risk and impact of detected changes, interactions need to be defined by causality (4) and directionality (5), and ultimately consider compound impacts (6) across commodities, supply chains and portfolios, as well as cross‐system interactions (7), for example, between climate change, water and biodiversity. We review each of these principles and related challenges individually, providing a system theory definition, relevant RS capabilities, and research directions. Addressing these seven principles will be crucial to harness satellite RS's potential for comprehensive biodiversity and water disclosure for strong corporate accountability.",2025-03-01,
"Modeling the relationship among the stock market, gold price, oil price and exchange rate: A VECM and VDA approach","Abstract Globalization and liberalization have heightened the volatility and complexity of financial markets, prompting investors to diversify their portfolios across different asset classes. This study investigates the dynamic interrelationships among the Indian stock market benchmark index (Nifty 50), gold prices, oil prices (Brent and WTI), and the USD/INR exchange rate, using high-frequency daily data from January 2009 to March 2023. By employing a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and Variance Decomposition Analysis (VDA), the study explores both the short-term and long-term dynamics between these asset classes. The results reveal that a long-term equilibrium exists among the variables, with significant cointegration, indicating that investors may not benefit from diversifying their portfolios across these assets. The VECM analysis further shows that the stock market is influenced by changes in gold prices, exchange rates, and oil prices, with long-run causality running from these variables to the Nifty 50. Variance decomposition highlights the growing impact of gold, exchange rates, and oil prices on stock market fluctuations over time. These findings provide crucial insights for investors, portfolio managers, and policy-makers, suggesting that external shocks in commodity prices and exchange rates can significantly affect stock market performance. The study concludes that understanding these dynamic linkages is essential for managing investment risks and formulating effective monetary and fiscal policies.",2025-03-01,
Combating The Crime of Illicit Speculation in Accordance with The Provisions of Law no 21-15,"The crime of Illicit speculation is one of the serious offenses that threaten the economy of Algeria and affect the interests of consumers, who are unable to purchase their needs in accordance with their purchasing power, due to price manipulation and the storage of goods and commodities, in order to create disturbances within the markets, by traders who aim to achieve profits. Faced with the inadequacy of the provisions of the Penal Code in confronting this crime when the Algerian legislator regulated the crime of Illicit speculation under the provisions of the Penal Code through articles 172,173,174 of Law No. 90-15amended and supplemented by Ordinance No. 156-66he offence of illicit speculation crime Any person who, directly or through an intermediary, artificially raises or reduces the price of goods, goods or paperwork public or private securities.

Warehouse Receipt Guarantee Fund As Protection For Holders Or Recipients Of Warehouse Receipt Guarantee Rights,"Introduction: The agricultural sector is the backbone of the Indonesian economy. However, farmers still face various challenges, including limited access to finance, fluctuating commodity prices, and the dominance of middlemen in the supply chain. These conditions hinder the improvement of farmers' productivity and welfare. The warehouse receipt system works by providing farmers with proof of ownership of their crops in the form of warehouse receipts that can be used as collateral to obtain loans from financial institutions, giving farmers flexibility in selling their crops. However, the warehouse receipt system still faces a number of challenges, including the risk of loss due to failure of the warehouse manager. To address this, the government has established the Warehouse Receipt Guarantee Corporation, which aims to protect farmers' rights and increase confidence in the system.Purposes of the Research: The purpose of this study is to examine how the warehouse receipt guarantee institution as a protection for warehouse receipt holders or recipients of collateral rights on warehouse receipts.Methods of the Research: This research is conducted in normative juridical, using literature data as secondary data to examine the rules and norms in law.Findings of the Research: The warehouse receipt guarantee institution provides protection and legal certainty to warehouse receipt holders and recipients of collateral rights from the failure of warehouse managers to carry out their duties which can result in physical damage to goods due to external factors such as natural disasters or internal factors such as negligence. This Warehouse Receipt Guarantee Agency will function as a guarantor like insurance if there are Warehouse Managers who experience bankruptcy. To protect the rights of warehouse receipt holders, Law Number 9 Year 2011 authorizes the Guarantee Institution to take action if the warehouse manager fails to perform his duties. The Guarantee Institution is authorized to make policies, handle problems, and even file for bankruptcy if necessary.",2025-02-28,
Energy vs. Precious Metals Funds Performance During Commodity Markets Volatility—Evidence from Poland,"Events of recent years, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, have caused significant fluctuations in financial markets, including energy and precious metals markets. Many investors see commodity investments as a way to diversify portfolio risk. The article’s main aim was to evaluate the performance of Polish commodity funds and analyze how external factors influenced their investment results from 2020 to 2023. Using popular investment fund performance metrics, it was determined that precious metals funds could not be considered effective during the 2020–2023 period, whereas the opposite conclusion applied to energy commodity funds. Additionally, mixed linear regression models showed that the average performance of precious metals funds was significantly positively influenced by the price of gold. Meanwhile, the performance of the average energy commodity fund was significantly positively impacted by the CRB Commodity Index value. The conducted analysis demonstrates that mixed linear regression models can be successfully applied in evaluating the external factors influencing the efficiency of commodity funds, taking into account their capital allocation policies. The obtained results can be utilized by current and potential participants of commodity funds, investors seeking portfolio diversification opportunities, and commodity fund managers to maximize investment performance.",2025-02-27,
Forecasting agricultural drought: the Australian Agriculture Drought Indicators,"Abstract. Drought is a recurrent and significant driver of stress on agricultural enterprises in Australia. Historically, rainfall indices have been used to identify drought and inform government responses. However, rainfall indicators overlook important factors such as drought propagation and commodity prices. To address these shortcomings, AADI (Australian Agriculture Drought Indicators) was recently developed to monitor and forecast drought for upcoming seasons using biophysical and agro-economic models, including crop yields, pasture growth, and farm profit at ~ 5 km2 resolution. Here, we evaluate the skill of drought indicator forecasts driven by the ACCESS-S2 dynamical global climate model over a hindcast period from 1990–2018. Analysis of the AADI hindcasts finds that antecedent landscape conditions significantly enhance predictive skill for crop yields, pasture growth, and farm profit across a financial year. As lead time shortens from 12 to 3 months, forecast confidence increases: median farm profit indicator skill rises from 43 % at 12 months to 67 % and 73 % at 6 and 3 months, respectively, whilst median farm profit biases remain below 2 % across all lead times, with high reliability indicating a well-calibrated ensemble, making the forecasts highly suitable for risk management and decision-making. Forecasts for wheat, sorghum, and pasture are also skilful and reliable in ensemble spread, although residual biases can occur (e.g., up to 20 % for sorghum), which suggests further system refinements are needed. Analysis of historical events in both dry and wet conditions demonstrated the AADI system’s ability to identify drought-impacted areas with increased confidence up to 6 months earlier than rainfall deficits.",2025-02-27,
"The integration of industry and finance, related party transactions and corporate default risks","In the process of China's economic transformation and financial reform, the combination of industry and finance has become increasingly prominent and an important force in promoting economic development. However, the accompanying risks cannot be ignored. This paper analyzes the impact mechanism of the combination of industry and finance of entity enterprises on enterprise default risk and the mechanism role of related transactions. It constructs panel data of Chinese listed entity companies for empirical testing. The research findings are as follows: (1) The combination of industry and finance increases the default risk of enterprises. With the influx of industrial capital into the financial field, although it promotes the diversification of enterprise operations, it also brings potential risks such as regulatory arbitrage and related transactions, leading to frequent enterprise defaults. (2) The mechanism test shows that the combination of industry and finance leads to an increase in related transactions between the entity parent company and the financial subsidiary, which in turn increases the default risk of the entity parent company. (3) Further research finds that different types of related transactions have different impacts on default risk. Compared with commodity transactions, capital-related transactions have a significant positive correlation with enterprise defaults.",2025-02-26,
Indonesian Gold Price Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach Using Random Forest Regressor,"This study applies the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to predict the price of Indonesian gold, using economic factors such as the Indonesia Composite Index (IHSG), silver prices (Perak), IDR/USD exchange rate, and crude oil prices (Minyak_Mentah). The dataset, spanning from 2015 to 2020 with 1,333 data points, is used for training and testing the model. The R-squared value achieved by the model is 0.9804, indicating that approximately 98% of the variance in gold prices is explained by the selected variables. The results show that the IDR/USD exchange rate has the highest correlation with gold prices (0.634892), followed by silver prices (0.546647), IHSG (0.224411), and crude oil prices (-0.027445), highlighting the significant role of currency and economic factors in gold price fluctuations. While the Random Forest model provided accurate predictions, the study acknowledges limitations, particularly the limited number of commodities considered. Further research should include additional variables and compare other machine learning algorithms, such as Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks, to improve prediction accuracy. The findings emphasize the value of machine learning in financial forecasting, offering a useful tool for investors and market analysts in predicting gold price trends.",2025-02-25,

Optimization of Energy Finance Risk Compliance Early Warning System Based on Machine Learning,"The energy finance sector is characterized by its complexity and volatility, driven by fluctuating commodity prices, regulatory changes and evolving market dynamics. Energy companies face financial, regulatory and operational risks, relying on historical data and static risk assessment frameworks that may not accurately reflect real-time market changes. This research aims to develop an energy finance risk compliance early warning system, leveraging a machine learning approach to enhance the early detection of compliance risks, enabling proactive decision-making and improving organizational resilience. Initially, data were collected from various sources, including historical financial records, market trends and regulatory frameworks. These data are essential for developing an early warning system that aims to enhance compliance risk detection in the energy sector. The collected data are preprocessed using cleaning and normalization and prepared for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using statistical methods such as correlation analysis and regression analysis to identify patterns and relationships between variables. The study proposes a novel Revenue Optimizer with a weighted Support Vector Machine (RO-WSVM) model to enhance risk detection and ensure regulatory compliance in energy finance. Optimizing revenue while adhering to compliance standards provides proactive insights for effective risk management and decision-making. The result demonstrates that the application of the proposed RO-WSVM model works successfully and this is because RO-WSVM has higher accuracy (90%), error value (0.1%) and less time taken to process the data than any other model (6[Formula: see text]s). The study highlights that the innovative approach RO-WSVM enhances the prediction model in the finance risk compliance early warning of energy finance.",2025-02-24,
"Navigating financial interconnectivity: analyzing oil, exchange rates and US market influences on Asia-Pacific equities using the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive connectedness approach","Purpose The study analyzes return spillovers among key financial markets, including equity indices (NIFTY50, NIKKEI225, KOSPI, ASX200, Shanghai-Composite and Hang-Seng), exchange rates (USD-INR, USD-YEN, USD-WON, USD-AUD and USD-RNMB) and Brent crude oil prices (Brent) in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the NASDAQ index from the US market. Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) connectedness approach to analyze the return spillovers in the Asia-Pacific region covering the period from March 2, 2005 to February 29, 2024. Findings The findings reveal that NASDAQ and NIFTY50R are significant transmitters of financial shocks, exerting a strong influence on other markets. In contrast, the Shanghai Composite Index and the South Korean Won act as net receivers, indicating their vulnerability to external influences. The interconnectedness between Brent crude oil prices and regional financial markets underscores the impact of global commodity price fluctuations on the financial stability of energy-dependent economies. Practical implications The study shows heightened interconnectedness during global financial crises, suggesting that market shocks can propagate more intensely across interconnected systems during such periods. These insights contribute to a better understanding of financial spillovers and highlight the need for effective risk management and policy coordination in the Asia-Pacific region.

"Causality Analysis of COVID-19 Induced Crashes in Stock and Commodity
  Markets: A Topological Perspective","The paper presents a comprehensive causality analysis of the US stock and commodity markets during the COVID-19 crash. The dynamics of different sectors are also compared. We use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on multidimensional time-series to identify crashes in stock and commodity markets. The Wasserstein Distance WD shows distinct spikes signaling the crash for both stock and commodity markets. We then compare the persistence diagrams of stock and commodity markets using the WD metric. A significant spike in the $WD$ between stock and commodity markets is observed during the crisis, suggesting significant topological differences between the markets. Similar spikes are observed between the sectors of the US market as well. Spikes obtained may be due to either a difference in the magnitude of crashes in the two markets (or sectors), or from the temporal lag between the two markets suggesting information flow. We study the Granger-causality between stock and commodity markets and also between different sectors. The results show a bidirectional Granger-causality between commodity and stock during the crash period, demonstrating the greater interdependence of financial markets during the crash. However, the overall analysis shows that the causal direction is from stock to commodity. A pairwise Granger-causal analysis between US sectors is also conducted. There is a significant increase in the interdependence between the sectors during the crash period. TDA combined with Granger-causality effectively analyzes the interdependence and sensitivity of different markets and sectors.",2025-02-20,
Bridging Borders: International business strategies for harmonizing sustainability in the oil and gas industry,"The ecological traits of the oil and gas industry are not homogeneous with the different regulatory frameworks, different expectations from stakeholders and technological differences in various areas. This review examines international business strategies addressed to these challenges and proposes mechanisms to facilitate international collaboration and sustainable development. Technology transfer, stakeholder engagement, and standardised sustainability metrics are key strategies identified for better accountability of best practices. The study highlights the critical importance of public-private partnerships and financial instruments like green bonds in overcoming the challenges of de-carbonizing our economy. Furthermore, it examines the extent to which renewable energy integration into operational strategies brings about synergy with global sustainability goals, especially the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research analyzes 16 case studies from different regional contexts to provide actionable insights about policy alignment, innovation promotion, and the creation of frameworks for multi-stakeholder collaboration. To make global sustainability efforts uniform and reflect the regulatory space discrepancies, the proposed strategic framework advocates for resource allocation equity, advocates the use of new technology, and harnesses the existing technology. With a focus on providing a helpful resource for policymakers, industry practitioners, and other stakeholders in their work to balance a progressive environmental stewardship approach with healthy economic growth and ecological preservation, this work is an invaluable commodity.",2025-02-18,
The strategic implications of financial derivatives in hedging corporate exposure to global economic volatility,"In an era of increasing global economic volatility, financial derivatives have become essential tools for corporations seeking to hedge against market uncertainties and safeguard financial stability. As businesses face risks from currency fluctuations, interest rate variations, and commodity price instability, the strategic deployment of derivatives—such as options, futures, forwards, and swaps—has emerged as a critical component of modern risk management frameworks. This paper explores the strategic implications of financial derivatives in mitigating corporate exposure to economic shocks, analyzing their role in enhancing financial predictability, optimizing capital allocation, and maintaining corporate solvency during turbulent market conditions. A comprehensive evaluation of derivative instruments highlights their effectiveness in hedging against systemic risks, particularly in industries highly sensitive to macroeconomic factors, such as energy, manufacturing, and financial services. However, the misuse or mismanagement of derivatives can expose firms to counterparty risks, liquidity concerns, and regulatory challenges, necessitating robust governance and risk assessment mechanisms. This study further examines corporate case studies and empirical data to assess how firms successfully integrate derivatives into their financial strategies, ensuring sustainable risk-adjusted returns. By bridging theoretical insights with real-world applications, this paper offers a strategic framework for businesses to leverage derivatives effectively while minimizing speculative exposure. It also underscores the importance of regulatory compliance, transparency, and corporate governance in ensuring that derivatives serve as risk mitigation tools rather than speculative instruments. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on corporate financial resilience, offering actionable insights for financial managers, policymakers, and investors navigating the complexities of global economic instability.",2025-02-16,
Analysis of technology adoption and government policy in improving the financial performance of SMEs in the Indonesia agricultural sector,"Agriculture micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have an important function but face problems in improving financial performance, including low net income of agricultural commodities per season, low yields per hectare, and low added value of processed agricultural products. The study aimed to analyze the effects of technology-based acceleration programs, digital literacy, and agricultural technology on financial sector performance in MSMEs within the agricultural sector in South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. The analysis method employed SEM-PLS on survey data collected from 160 respondents proportionally representing 13 regencies and four cities in South Sumatra Province. The independent variables consisted of the intensity of participation in technology-based acceleration programs, including mentoring, training, incubation, agricultural product development, and entrepreneurship.

Optimizing the Value Chain for Perishable Agricultural Commodities: A Strategic Approach for Jordan,"Efficient supply chain management for perishable agricultural commodities is essential to mitigate post-harvest losses, enhance profitability, and ensure food security. This study focuses on optimizing the supply chain for perishables in Jordan by addressing challenges in transportation, storage, and stakeholder practices. Data from 367 stakeholders, including farmers, transporters, and retailers, provided insights into the dynamics of the supply chain. Descriptive, inferential, and simulation-based methods were employed to evaluate optimization strategies. Descriptive statistics revealed a reduction in post-harvest losses from 17.38% pre-intervention to 15.16% post-intervention, while regression analysis identified transportation conditions, technology adoption, and environmental factors as critical predictors of losses. Simulation models demonstrated the potential for loss reductions of up to 20% under high-improvement scenarios. Financial analysis showed a total saving of $11,149.45, reflecting a 12.83% improvement in profitability. Transportation improvements and technology adoption emerged as the most impactful interventions, significantly reducing losses and enhancing supply chain performance. Comparative analyses validated the significance of these reductions, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed strategies. This study highlights the transformative potential of targeted interventions in reducing losses, improving financial outcomes, and promoting sustainable agricultural systems. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on supply chain optimization and offer actionable solutions for addressing inefficiencies in the management of perishable commodities, ensuring better profitability and food security.",2025-02-13,
Impact of Public Interest on Agricultural CommodityPrices,"<title>Abstract</title> As financial markets grow more complex and sophisticated, the use of diverse data sources has become essential for accurate market analysis and prediction. This study leverages Google Trends data, representing public search interest, and combines it with a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to explore its impact on futures prices for major agricultural commodities. By applying the model to commodities such as corn, wheat, cocoa, and coffee, we analyze how fluctuations in public interest influence price volatility. The results confirm that periods of heightened search frequency for specific words often correspond to changes in futures price behavior, indicating that public sentiment plays a role in market dynamics. This study demonstrates that integrating social data, like Google Trends, into financial forecasting frameworks can enhance predictive accuracy and market insights, analyzing that the relationship between investors’ sentiment and commodity prices in the financial market quantitatively.",2025-02-12,
"Swedish Copper, Spanish Hulls: Hans Jacob Gahn, a Global Arms Race, and Consuls’ Economic Impact (1780–1784)","Interregional and global economic connections continued to grow in the eighteenth century, but we know less about consuls’ impact on commodity chains that were stretched thin across large distances. Using a microhistorical approach, we look at the activities of a Swedish consul in Cadiz, Hans Jacob Gahn, who supplied large amounts of copper sheets to the Spanish navy. It was Gahn’s position as an official representative, not merely his networks in Spain and Sweden, that was crucial for winning and executing the contract: his consular post enabled him to leverage his social, political, and financial capital to drastically alter trade flows for the years he held the contract. As contractors, consuls had a significant economic function for both their sending and receiving states.",2025-02-12,

Despite their countless invaluable applications, many in society are calling for restriction or elimination of their production and use, as their synthesis and challenges in disposal negatively impact our environment. For instance, while plastics help save energy by reducing the weight of cars and planes, their production is energy intensive and creates more than a gigaton of carbon dioxide annually. Likewise, the durability of plastics is lauded in many applications but becomes a drawback when they contribute to persistent environmental pollution. Plastics are essential in the products that protect us, such as masks and safety glasses, yet they also generate pollution and toxins that endanger our health. Although plastics are affordable and convenient for single-use applications, they quickly turn into large quantities of waste that must be managed. In essence, plastics are indispensable yet problematic─we cannot live without them, yet living with them is also a serious concern. It is now evident that our reliance on plastics has reached a turning point, and continuing with the status quo is no longer a viable option.The polymer community is actively striving to create more sustainable plastics─materials that are valuable in use yet do not pose a threat to the planet and human health. To date, the focus has primarily been on discovering new materials that are biodegradable or chemically recyclable, and increasing attention is now being given to innovative methods for reusing and recycling existing commodity plastics through upcycling and mechanical recycling. These efforts aim to preserve the benefits of plastics while minimizing their environmental impact.In this special issue of Chemical Reviews, leading researchers report progress in some of these fundamental areas and share their latest results in this exciting area of polymer science. Regarding improving the sustainability of synthesis, two reviews focus on the use of renewable feedstocks. Carbon dioxide is an ideal C1 feedstock for synthesizing sustainable materials because it is renewable, abundant, and inexpensive. At the same time, it brings little thermodynamic driving force, requiring the use of reactive comonomers. Nozaki and co-workers review the growing literature on the synthesis of monomers from carbon dioxide and conjugated dienes such as butadiene, which allows the synthesis of new carbon dioxide-derived copolymers. Sulfur is one of the top ten most abundant elements on earth, making it an ideal element to incorporate into large scale polymers. Sulfur-containing polymers often exhibit enhanced thermal and mechanical properties and exhibit high refractive indices. Ren and co-workers review polymers derived from sulfur-containing monomers such as dithiols, carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, cyclic thioanhydrides, episulfides, and elemental sulfur.Strategies for addressing the end-of-life issues of plastics can be divided into three main categories: 1) biodegradable polymers; 2) chemical recycling of polymers; and 3) mechanical recycling of polymers. For polymers that inadvertently accumulate in the environment, biodegradability is perhaps the best approach to avoid persistence in the environment and limit microplastics formation. Chen and co-workers review the biodegradability of current commercial polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid), poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate)s, poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(butylene succinate), and poly(butylene-adipate terephthalate), along with their chemical and mechanical recycling. Hakkarainen and co-workers review the molecular design of new polyester backbones to improve biodegradability under a wide range of environmental conditions and enhance circularity. Huber and co-workers highlight the properties and industrial applications of commercial biodegradable plastics and outline how biomass-derived monomers can create new types of biodegradable plastics while also providing a critical assessment of the criteria that must be met for materials to be considered truly biodegradable. Two reviews provide valuable perspectives on the chemical recycling of polyolefins. A review by Mecking and co-workers focuses not only on the valorization of polyethylene but also on novel methods of forming functional polyethylene-type materials from natural seed oils, ethylene, and comonomers. Scott and co-workers detail four catalytic upcycling strategies for polyolefins: hydrogenolysis, (hydro)cracking, tandem processes involving metathesis, and selective oxidation. Shaver and Clark comprehensively overview the depolymerization of five commercial polymers: poly(ethylene terephthalate), polycarbonates, polyamides, aliphatic polyesters, and polyurethanes. Wang and co-workers discuss the key advances in olefin-metathesis-based chemical recycling technologies, along with the application of olefin metathesis to the valorization of commercial materials. Zhang and co-workers provide an overview of recent advancements in using dynamic covalent chemistry to impart recyclability in covalent networks. Eagan and co-workers provide the only review on additives to enable mechanical recycling, including design parameters of a polymeric compatibilizer, the testing of blends, the synthetic methods of producing economically viable additives, and surveys of the literature of compatibilized blends of HDPE, LLDPE, LDPE, and iPP.Together, these reviews cover many of the long-standing and emerging areas of sustainable plastics. Although the reviews do not comprise exhaustive coverage of the entire field, we believe they do an excellent job of providing valuable insights into the field.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorGeoffrey W.

Evaluation of Performance of a Person using Virtual Stock Market,"This project's goal was to use research and trading simulations to acquire a fundamental understanding of the stock market. Using suitable investment and technical analysis methodologies along with online simulation tools, investment theory was put into practice. During the simulation, stocks were traded using several tactics. A number of trading techniques' outcomes were analysed and ranked based on profitability. There was also a discussion of each strategy's efficacy. It is obvious that one of the most popular topics these days is the stock market, but what is it really? Sometimes, it needs to be clarified what is intended. The stock market is where? Or is there another possibility? It is an entirely abstract idea for many people. A lot of individuals believe that the stock market and Wall Street are identical to one another. However, Wall Street is the hub of trade and the birthplace of the largest financial market in the world. In actuality, the phrase “stock market” refers to the idea of a system that makes it possible to trade derivatives, other securities, and firm shares. Derivatives are traded on many exchanges, and commodities are exchanged on commodity markets. Most consumers need the resources or financial know-how to trade on stock exchanges. This study aimed to improve people's capacity for learning and their fearlessness. A web-based virtual stock trading system (VST) with integrated financial indicator analysis was created to mimic the stock market. It is anticipated that when students study with objective financial analysis, their mental states will be unaffected by the news, and students who follow market movements can become logical investors.",2025-02-11,
Conclusion,"Abstract When information was lacking, delays were caused and financial damage was threatened. To be successful in early modern business, merchants needed knowledge of commodities, shipping, exchange rates, and local markets; they required education in business etiquette; and they relied on personal information such as recommendations and character testimonies. All of this information, gleaned from a variety of sources, shaped merchants’ decision-making processes. The short concluding chapter to this book underscores my central themes: arguing for the specificity of business information and critiquing the role of the ‘print revolution’ in business.",2025-02-10,
Agricultural Product Price Prediction Based on the Quadratic Decomposition of CEEMDAN-VMD,"Focusing on agricultural futures price forecasting, a prediction method based on quadratic decomposition is proposed in this paper in response to the non-stationarity, unstructured nature, and nonlinearity of agricultural price-time series data. Then drawing on the successes of deep learning in other financial domains, the quadratic decomposition of CEEMDAN-VMD that effectively addresses the non-stationarity of agricultural price-time series is introduced. And by constructing the CEEMDAN-SE-VMD-LSTM model, the paper performs an in-depth decomposition and refined processing of daily agricultural price data, successfully capturing the subtle characteristics of price fluctuations to achieve higher precision in forecasting. Moreover, the results indicates that the CEEMDAN-VMD model outperforms the comparative models in terms of forecasting accuracy for the three types of agricultural commodities.",2025-02-10,
Speculative labour: The financialized imagination of creative work and the assetization of digital art through non-fungible tokens (NFTs),"This article investigates – based on semi-structured interviews and conversations on cryptoart forums – how digital artists experience the blockchain-enabled assetization of their work through non-fungible tokens, including the transformation of digital artworks (which previously had negligible if any economic value) into assets capable of increasing in price value over time and generating future income from resale provisions. We show how this assetization of digital artworks has kindled artists’ financialized imagination and incentivized them to perform speculative labour – that is, to speculate on the potential capture of future financial proceeds from present-day underpaid or uncompensated activities, while mobilizing fictional expectations of imagined rentiership futures. We suggest that the commodification thesis, which has traditionally explained the future orientation of creative work as tied to commodity exchange, may be insufficient to account for artists’ speculative, asset-based imaginations of the future under financialized capitalism. Therefore, it may be beneficial to complement it with an assetization lens.",2025-02-08,

The study aims to shed light on these businesses' stability, performance, and financial health in an unstable economy. Drawing upon a dataset spanning multiple years, various financial ratios are scrutinized, including liquidity ratios, profitability indicators, leverage ratios, and efficiency measures. This paper analyses the comparative financial performance of Indian companies like Jindal Steel, Coal India, Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, and Bharat Forge during 2020-2023. Various ratios have been used to evaluate the financial health of certain companies. These include the following: leverage, profitability, activity, liquidity, and market value. The result demonstrates that Coal India has the strongest current ratio, indicating strong short-term financial strength. From 2020 through 2023, Hindalco Industries generated more earnings per share of their shareholder’s investment than others. However, the profitability of Coal India was much better in 2020-23 comparto all other companies. Key findings reveal the sector's resilience in fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes. Moreover, the study identifies trends in financial performance across different segments of the metals and mining industry, shedding light on variations in profitability, efficiency, and risk management practices.",2025-02-07,
Elevating larval source management as a key strategy for controlling malaria and other vector-borne diseases in Africa,"Larval source management (LSM) has a long history of advocacy and successes but is rarely adopted where funds are limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on malaria prevention recommend the use of LSM as a supplementary intervention to the core vector control methods (insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying), arguing that its feasibility in many settings can be limited by larval habitats being numerous, transient, and difficult to find or treat. Another key argument is that there is insufficient high-quality evidence for its effectiveness to support wide-scale implementation. However, the stagnation of progress towards malaria elimination demands that we consider additional options to the current emphasis on insecticidal commodities targeting adult mosquitoes inside homes. This letter is the result of a global, crossdisciplinary collaboration comprising: (a) detailed online expert discussions, (b) a narrative review of countries that have eliminated local malaria transmission, and (c) a mathematical modeling exercise using two different approaches. Together, these efforts culminated in seven key recommendations for elevating larval source management as a strategy for controlling malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases in Africa (Box 1). LSM encompasses the use of larvicide (a commodity) as well as various environmental sanitation measures. Together, these efforts lead to the long-term reduction of mosquito populations, which benefits the entire community by controlling both disease vector and nuisance mosquitoes. In this paper, we argue that the heavy reliance on large-scale cluster-randomized controlled trials (CRTs) to generate evidence on epidemiological endpoints restricts the recommendation of approaches to only those interventions that can be measured by functional units and deliver relatively uniform impact and, therefore, are more likely to receive financial support for conducting these trials. The explicit impacts of LSM may be better captured by using alternative evaluation approaches, especially high-quality operational data and a recognition of locally distinct outcomes and tailored strategies. LSM contributions are also evidenced by the widespread use of LSM strategies in nearly all countries that have successfully achieved malaria elimination. Two modelling approaches demonstrate that a multifaceted strategy, which incorporates LSM as a central intervention alongside other vector control methods, can effectively mitigate key biological threats such as insecticide resistance and outdoor biting, leading to substantial reductions in malaria cases in representative African settings. This argument is extended to show that the available evidence is sufficient to establish the link between LSM approaches and reduced disease transmission of mosquito-borne illnesses. What is needed now is a significant boost in the financial resources and public health administration structures necessary to train, employ and deploy local-level workforces tasked with suppressing mosquito populations in scientifically driven and ecologically sensitive ways. In conclusion, having WHO guidelines that recognize LSM as a key intervention to be delivered in multiple contextualized forms would open the door to increased flexibility for funding and aid countries in implementing the strategies that they deem appropriate. Financially supporting the scale-up of LSM with high-quality operations monitoring for vector control in combination with other core tools can facilitate better health. The global health community should reconsider how evidence and funding are used to support LSM initiatives.",2025-02-07,
Commodity Price Crash Risk and Crash Risk Contagion,"ABSTRACT In this study, we propose measures for the risk of commodity price crash. Building on the recent phenomenon of financialization of commodities, we advocate the use of down‐to‐up volatility (DUVOL) and a negative coefficient of skewness (NCSKEW) using 1‐min and daily data, respectively. We find that the crash risk is the highest for natural gas, sugar, and coffee and remains low to moderate for most precious metals. Subsequently, we explore the commodity‐specific drivers of crash risk upon controlling for macro‐economic variations. We find that speculation and hedging pressure exacerbate the crash risk of most commodities, whereas basis risk alleviates the crash risk of commodities. We document that crash risk is priced in the cross‐section of commodity returns. We also find that the crash risk spillovers are asymmetric, remaining low at 33% at the median and peaking at approximately 88% during the extremities.",2025-02-07,
The dependency structure of international commodity and stock markets after the Russia-Ukraine war,"In recent years, the international community has witnessed many crisis events, and the Russia-Ukraine war, which broke out on 24th February 2022, has increased international policy uncertainty and impacted the current world commodity and financial markets. Thus, we try to capture how the Russia-Ukraine war has affected the correlation structure of international commodity and stock markets. We study six groups of commodity daily returns and one group of stock daily returns and select the sample from 24th February 2022 to 1st June 2022 as the sample during the Russia-Ukraine war; in addition, we select the sample from 1st December 2019 to 31st December 2020 as the sample during COVID-19 control group, and the sample from 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2017 as the non-extreme event control group, to explore the correlation structure of international commodity and stock markets before the war, and to compare and uncover the impact of the uncertain event of the Russia-Ukraine war on the commodity and stock markets. In this paper, the marginal density function of each series is constructed using the ARMA-GARCH-std method, and the R-Vine copula model is built based on the marginal density function to analyze the correlation relationship between each market. From the Tree1 of the Vine copula, it is found that crude oil becomes the core connecting each commodity market and the stock market during the Russia-Ukraine war. The price fluctuations of crude oil may be contagious to agricultural and precious metal markets in the same direction, while the stock market price fluctuations are inversely correlated with commodity markets. Comparison with the selected control group sample reveals that the Russia-Ukraine war increases the correlation between the markets and enhances the possibility of risk transmission. The core of the correlation structure shifts from agricultural commodities and precious metals to crude oil after the Russia-Ukraine war.",2025-02-06,
Developing a data-driven approach to optimizing pharmacy inventory management,"The stock of products, commodities, or other financial resources that are kept or set aside for future production or to satisfy future demand is known as inventory. For example, inventory can include raw materials that are awaiting use in the creation of items, finished goods that are awaiting shipping from the factory, wholesaler, or retailer, and semi-finished or in-process goods that are temporarily held throughout the production process. Equipment, furnishings, fittings, etc. are also included in inventory. Direct and indirect inventories are two categories under which the term inventory can be separated. Items that directly contribute to the manufacturing process and are a necessary component of final goods are included in direct inventories. Raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished commodities are the three categories into which direct inventories can be divided. Items that are required for manufacturing but do not end up in the final product, such as lubricants, grease, oil, gasoline, office supplies, maintenance supplies, etc., are included in indirect inventories. Although there are many reasons why inventories are kept, they generally serve the following fundamental purposes.",2025-02-06,
Multifractal analysis of Bitcoin price dynamics,"This research employs Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) to investigate multifractal properties in financial variables, including Bitcoin prices and economic indicators. Spanning 2019–2022, the analysis reveals multifractal scaling not only in Bitcoin prices, but also in economic indicators such as inflation rates and energy commodity prices. The non-linear singularity spectra unveil the multifaceted nature of scaling properties. Temporal analysis exposes intriguing trends in multifractality with implications for market efficiency. Furthermore, correlation analysis unveils connections among multifractal properties. For instance, a positive correlation between oil prices and Bitcoin suggests similar market forces. The log-log plot of fluctuation function Fq versus lag size demonstrates a power-law relationship, characteristic of multifractal systems. The empirical data’s alignment in log-log space suggests self-similarity in the Bitcoin time series, supporting multifractality. The calculated Hurst exponents values suggest varying degrees of multifractality across the years, with 2021 exhibiting the highest degree and 2022 the lowest. Furthermore, an asymmetry index (0.5767) deviating from 0.5 indicates that the multifractal nature of the Bitcoin market is not symmetric. This research enhances risk assessment and portfolio optimization in finance. It challenges the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), emphasizing the significance of MFDFA in comprehending financial market and economic factor’s relationships.",2025-02-03,
A Study on Factor Affecting Investment Decision among Working Women with Special Reference to Kamrej City,"Indian women are now currently engaging in all spheres of society, including but not limited to the classroom, the political arena, the media, the scientific community, technological sphere. Women's participation in investing their surplus funds has increased in recent years however, their success in doing so still depends on factors like their risk tolerance, the sway they have with their social circle, and how difficult it is for them to learn about and gain access to cutting-edge financial tools. The purpose of investment is to gain a profitable returns by investing money .A variety of investment avenues are available to individuals fixed deposit, insurance policies, government securities, corporate bonds, Shares and mutual fund, real estates, commodities, chit funds, post office schemes, investment in gold and silver.

Examining the influence of age and gender on risk tolerance and investment preferences of retail investors in Ahmedabad city,"The purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between gender and age in Ahmedabad City retail investors' risk tolerance and investing strategies. Combining quantitative and qualitative research, a mixed-methods approach was used to get complete insights on investing behaviour. Structured questionnaires were used to gather data from 500 retail investors. Significant associations were examined using statistical methods such logistic regression, chi-square tests, and ordinal regression. Investors in their twenties and thirties seemed to be more likely to take risks than those in their forties and fifties, suggesting a strong correlation between age and risk tolerance. Yet, there was no correlation between risk tolerance and investors aged 55 and above, which may indicate a change in focus when it comes to money. On top of that, there was a marked gender gap in the investing preferences of male and female investors; the former favoured commodities, cryptocurrencies, and individual stocks, while the latter favoured bonds and mutual funds. This research adds to our knowledge of retail investors' habits and may help policymakers and financial planners better target certain demographics with their investing strategy.",2025-02-01,
Pre‐Crisis Conditions and Financial Crisis Duration,"ABSTRACT This paper examines how pre‐crisis conditions affect the duration of different types of financial crises using a data sample of 311 financial crises in 89 countries over the period 1985–2019. Results from our parametric survival analysis show that the duration of any type of financial crisis is longer for countries having higher levels of public debt prior to financial crises, whereas it is shorter for countries characterised by higher pre‐crisis levels of (i) current account balance, (ii) international reserves, (iii) GDP growth and (iv) institutional quality. Similarly, while pegged exchange rate regimes, productivity shocks and negative commodity price shocks are associated with a longer duration of financial crises, majority governments help countries emerge faster from crises. Moreover, pre‐crisis expansion of fiscal and monetary policies helps to shorten financial crises. We also find a positive effect of pre‐crisis fiscal balance on the probability of crisis ending, and it is noteworthy that this effect is strengthened under majority governments and a stronger institutional environment. Our empirical findings offer some important policy implications.",2025-01-31,
The Role and Effectiveness of Insurance and Hedging in Reducing the Risk of Financing Decisions,"Purpose: This study examines the role and effectiveness of combining insurance and hedging as complementary strategies for managing financing risk in volatile economic environments. By investigating how these two risk management tools work together, the study aims to provide insights into how companies can optimize their financial stability through integrated risk mitigation. Research Design and Methodology: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyze recent research on insurance and hedging within financial risk management frameworks. The study evaluates empirical and theoretical sources to explore the synergy between these strategies and their applicability across different risk scenarios. Findings and Discussion: The findings reveal that insurance protects companies from direct operational risks, such as asset damage and unexpected losses, while hedging mitigates market volatility risks, including interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The combined use of these tools offers a dual-layered approach, providing comprehensive protection against diverse financial risks. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of regulatory support in facilitating access to these instruments, strengthening corporate resilience and stakeholder confidence. Implications: This research contributes to theory and practice by enhancing understanding of dual-instrument risk management. For managers, the findings serve as a guide for selecting appropriate risk mitigation strategies and balancing cost-efficiency and stability. For policymakers, the study underscores the need for a supportive regulatory environment to implement these strategies effectively.

ANALISIS PENGEMBANGAN DESA PERHUTANAN SOSIAL BERBASIS KOMODITI KOPI MELALUI SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD APPROACH: STUDI KASUS DESA KEKUYANG KECAMATAN KETOL KABUPATEN ACEH TENGAH,"The Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA) is very relevant in managing coffee commodities in Central Aceh through the Social Forestry program that allows communities to manage forests sustainably. This study used in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), and field observations to understand the factors that influence the sustainability of community livelihoods. SLA assesses five main assets, namely natural, human, physical, financial, and social. Although human and physical assets have potential, there is an urgent need to strengthen access to social and financial assets. Limited education, skills, and less solid social networks can hinder community economic development. Although infrastructure and natural resources are supportive, dependence on financial access and cooperation between community members is still a major challenge. To improve community welfare and coffee sustainability, there needs to be increased training and more practical counseling, as well as access to capital through microfinance institutions. Building stronger social networks, with collaboration from external parties such as government and non-governmental organizations, is important to strengthen community solidarity. These steps are expected to increase the economic and social resilience of the community while maintaining environmental sustainability.",2025-01-31,
Evaluation of the impact of Monetary Policy on Macroeconomic Stability in Indonesia,"This study aims to evaluate the effect of monetary policy on macroeconomic stability in Indonesia in the period 2018-2023. Monetary policies implemented by Bank Indonesia, such as changes in benchmark interest rates and controlling the money supply, play an important role in maintaining inflation, exchange rates, and economic growth. Using time series-based quantitative methods, this study analyzed secondary data from Bank Indonesia, the Central Bureau of Statistics, and related international sources. The results showed that monetary policy is effective in controlling inflation and maintaining exchange rate stability, although external challenges such as fluctuations in global commodity prices continue to affect Indonesia's economic performance. Additionally, the study highlights the role of global financial market volatility and geopolitical tensions, which can limit the effectiveness of domestic monetary policies. Despite these challenges, Bank Indonesia's adaptive strategies, including macroprudential measures and policy rate adjustments, have contributed significantly to mitigating negative external shocks. This study provides recommendations for increased coordination between monetary and fiscal policies as well as monetary policy flexibility in facing the challenges of a dynamic global economy. Strengthening institutional frameworks and enhancing transparency in policy communication are also suggested to improve investor confidence and ensure sustainable economic growth.",2025-01-31,
Ad hoc hedging on the grain market in Ukraine,"Introduction. In today's environment of price instability in global commodity markets and fluctuating exchange rates, grain companies are being forced to look for new, non-standard methods of hedging financial transactions in order to respond quickly to current economic changes. The purpose of the paper is to study the features of price, currency and external risks of the grain business, as well as to identify the main characteristics and to justify possibilities of using ad hoc hedging on the grain market in Ukraine. Results. It was emphasized that the effective use of ad hoc hedging reduces uncertainty and risk for producers, traders and exporters, helping to increase the competitiveness of the grain market and ensure Ukraine's economic stability in the face of global instability. The study presents a SWOT-analysis of ad hoc hedging on the grain market in Ukraine, particularly as its strengths and weaknesses, as the opportunities and threats to development. It was highlighted that grain companies have limited access to futures or options due to underdeveloped derivatives market in Ukraine and the lack of functioning agricultural stock market. Therefore, grain companies use financial instruments such as forward contracts or manual balancing of cash flows by combining different types of loans or deposits. Conclusions. It was determined that ad hoc hedging is an appropriate and effective risk management method for small and medium-sized grain companies that do not have access to complex financial instruments and do not need to use them. In addition, it was concluded that ad hoc hedging is not a planned risk management method and does not have a single type of financial instrument for its use.",2025-01-30,
The introduction of innovative technologies in the logistics of synthetic rubber production,"The chapter describes the characteristics of rubber production in world and Russian practice. There is a growing demand for rubber worldwide due to the development of the production of rubber products, in particular, tires for the automotive industry, sports shoes, the needs of healthcare and the production of medical equipment, and the development of the construction industry. Synthetic rubber has become a serious alternative to natural rubber as a material with greater durability and higher productivity in its production. An assessment of the Russian market for the production of synthetic rubber in primary forms is given. It is noted that this market is highly concentrated with obvious signs of monopolization. The sales leader in this market is PJSC Nizhnekamskneftekhim, whose share in 2023 amounted to more than 75%. An assessment of the trends in the development of the production activities of this organization for the period 2010–2023 was carried out, conclusions were drawn about the general trend of sales growth with deviations during the pandemic and in modern conditions of sanctions pressure on the economy of the Russian Federation. There is a decrease in the financial stability of the organization, which, however, has maintained its profitability and return on sales above the industry average. The business process of material and technical support of PJSC Nizhnekamskneftekhim is considered. It is noted that the procurement service employees spend most of their working time applying for low-value goods. It is proposed to solve this problem by developing a logistics module within the framework of the implemented Unified Corporate Template, which allows approving procurement documents in electronic form, as well as by introducing the MarketPlace online store as an innovative technology for purchasing low-value goods. The research used general scientific (analysis, synthesis, analogy, generalization), as well as private (observation, comparison, measurement and description) methods. The methodology of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia for assessing economic concentration in commodity markets is used. The object of the study was the type of economic activity – the production of synthetic rubber in primary forms (OKVED code: 20.17).",2025-01-29,

"Price factors in the corn market: technical, fundamental and seasonal aspects","The article explores the key price factors influencing the market value formation of corn, focusing on fundamental, technical, and seasonal aspects. A detailed analysis of supply and demand, export-import operations, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory restrictions has been conducted as critical components of fundamental price formation. Special attention is paid to the impact of production levels, external economic trends, agricultural policies, and changing climate conditions, which shape the overall context of price formation in the corn market. A significant part of the study is dedicated to technical analysis, including the use of moving averages, support and resistance levels, and market indicators (RSI, MACD) to identify entry and exit points in the market. The correlation between corn prices and other financial assets is also examined, helping to understand potential market movements. The article also examines the seasonal dynamics of corn prices, considering historical patterns and the influence of weather conditions on yields. The cyclical nature of the corn market, which is observed throughout the year, allows for price trend predictions, which is crucial for farmers, traders, and analysts working in the agricultural market. The findings confirm that an integrated approach to corn market analysis — combining fundamental, technical, and seasonal approaches — significantly enhances the effectiveness of risk management in the agricultural commodity market. Practical recommendations are provided on how to apply the results to optimize hedging strategies, forecast price fluctuations, and make effective trading decisions. These strategies help minimize potential losses and ensure stability in the corn market, providing better decision-making tools for stakeholders in the agricultural industry.

ФУНКЦІОНУВАННЯ РИНКІВ ВИРОБНИЧИХ РЕСУРСІВ,"The article is devoted to the issue of the functioning of markets for production resources. The essence of the market as a complex and multifaceted phenomenon is revealed, which is a set of relations associated with the purchase and sale of goods and services. Market relations are regulated by the ratio of demand and supply, as well as the method of interaction between producers and consumers, which is based on the price component. The market is an intermediate link between production and consumption and the sphere of entrepreneurial activity. The possibilities of enterprises to achieve economic goals are resource-limited in physical, economic and legal aspects. A market system is a set of interconnected markets that cover various areas of human activity. The commodity market functions through the interaction of producers, traders, and consumers through the determination of the price of raw materials that underpin the global economy. A resource used to produce a certain amount of economic goods for profit is capital, which exists in various forms: material (physical capital) and monetary (financial capital). The demand for capital, as for any factor of production, depends on its marginal profitability. Land as a factor of production differs from capital in that it does not have the ability to reproduce. The legal basis for the creation of a land market was laid by the adoption of the new Land Code in Ukraine. The labor market is a specific commodity market, one of the most complex, as it encompasses not only the goods offered, but also a whole complex of social and labor relations, the quality of which will determine the efficiency of using the goods themselves. The course of processes in the labor market determines the level of wages. The demand of an enterprise for a productive resource is a derived demand and depends on the consumer's demand for its final product. Such productive resources as land, labor, and capital are productive and interdependent. The supply of resources in the market changes under the influence of price and non-price factors. In the modern world, the use of more progressive and expensive resources, such as innovative entrepreneurial abilities, digital resources, is becoming more relevant, which causes an increase in the role of intellectual capital in production activities. Ukrainian digital markets are developing extremely rapidly and have great potential to ensure the growth of the country's economy and competition, including at the international level.",2025-01-29,
Basel III and South African Banking: Assessing the Effects,"This special issue of the South African Journal of Economics (SAJE) showcases pioneering research on the impact of Basel III regulatory reforms in South Africa. These reforms, developed in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 financial crisis, were crafted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to make banks less likely to collapse under the pressure of the next financial storm and prevent systemic crises that could jeopardise the global economy. At its core, Basel III represents a comprehensive overhaul of the international regulatory landscape that seeks to address the catastrophic market failures exposed by the global financial crisis, introducing more stringent capital and liquidity requirements while bolstering bank supervision and risk management protocols. Besides strengthening bank-specific risk profiles and funding sources, the new framework also introduced an innovative set of macroprudential rules that regulate banks' capital, assets and liquidity on the broad economy's cycle and banks' interconnectedness. The South African experience with the biggest financial turmoil in the history of modern capitalism was markedly different from that of many advanced economies. Its banking sector remained largely unaffected by the direct exposure to toxic assets like mortgage-backed securities. South African banks, including the big five (Standard Bank, Absa, FirstRand, Nedbank and Capitec), were not heavily involved in high-risk derivatives or subprime mortgage lending; thus, they did not suffer the same scale of losses as their global counterparts in the United States and Europe. This stability was partly due to the conservative banking practices that were in place, as well as strict regulatory oversight by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). Nevertheless, the country was not immune to the global downturn, particularly through trade and investment channels, resulting in a sharp credit contraction, a drop in equity prices and currency value, which further led to a reduction in investment and slower economic growth. Against this backdrop, South Africa engaged actively with international regulatory bodies, including the Financial Stability Board and the G20, to align national reforms with Basel III standards. Setting a benchmark for other nations on the African continent, Basel III regulations were gradually phased in over a 6-year transition period starting in January 2013, although with some specific modifications to better suit local market conditions. The SARB adopted a nuanced strategy, focusing exclusively on bank-based measures. While imposing capital requirements more stringent than the global recommendations, it maintained flexibility in other areas. For instance, the countercyclical capital buffer has remained at zero, reflecting subdued credit growth, and banks were granted leeway in meeting liquidity requirements through a broader range of qualifying assets. This balanced approach allowed South Africa to uphold the spirit of Basel III while adapting to its unique economic landscape. Notably, the SARB demonstrated agility during the COVID-19 pandemic, temporarily relaxing certain prudential measures to support financial stability and economic resilience. Understanding the effect of bank regulation requires the academic community to pose and answer a series of key questions: To what extent have Basel III reforms enhanced the overall stability of the global financial system, especially during periods of financial stress (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic, commodity price volatility and geopolitical tensions)? Have the capital and liquidity requirements under Basel III impacted the profitability of banks? And does this effect depend on bank characteristics? How has Basel III affected competition in the banking sector, especially between large, systemically important banks and smaller, niche or non-bank institutions? Have the Basel III reforms led to changes in financial intermediation and business models? How was the credit market shaped by the new set of rules? Did the latter alter the distribution of lending and financial inclusion? How does Basel III impact economic growth? Are there any trade-offs between financial stability and economic growth, particularly regarding access to credit and investment flows? The list of questions is extensive and continues to expand. However, empirical research examining the effects of Basel III and prudential regulation has emerged only recently, primarily focusing on high-income Western economies. In South Africa, despite the extent of regulatory coverage and the size of the financial sector, a consistent attempt to identify how the regulatory changes stemmed from the Basel agreements have affected the banking sector and, through it, the real economy was missing until today. The objective of this special issue is to fill this gap and provide the reader with the first systematic overview on the achievements and challenges emerged out of the latest decades of prudential regulation in South Africa. The papers featured in this special issue represent the culmination of a collaborative research initiative supported by the SARB. This institutional backing enabled researchers to access important data and convene for a series of workshops. The latter were a fertile environment for intellectual exchange, allowing researchers to refine their methodologies and sharpen their analyses. This support has not only enhanced the quality and depth of the research presented but also strengthened the link between academic inquiry and practical policy formulation. This introductory essay is followed by a selection of original research papers written by experts in the field of banking, financial markets and monetary policy. Although the invited contributions take distinct angles and adopt a variety of alternative methodological approaches, taken together, they synthetise our current knowledge of South Africa's banking sector and, particularly, the intended and unintended consequences of regulatory changes. A key analytical feature of the empirical studies collected in this volume is the single country focus. Single-country studies allow researchers to delve deeply into the specific institutions and dynamics of one economy, often obscured in cross-country comparisons. This consistency allows not only for more precise analysis of economic phenomena in each context but also for access to more detailed and comparable data. Notably, a great deal of the research published herein was possible because of the exceptional granularity of publicly available banking sector data, collected by the SARB over a 30-year period, which would be challenging to obtain for multiple countries. Perhaps most importantly, findings from single-country studies can be directly applicable to policymaking within that country. Besides producing a new array of empirical evidence, this volume's contribution is methodological too. An interesting example is given by those papers concerned with identifying the effect of a given independent variable or policy shock. The paper by Sibande and Milne, for example, builds on existing scholarship that distinguishes capital changes to isolate the policy-induced ones from those attributed to changes in portfolio risk. Instead, both the paper by Merrino, Lesame and Chondrogiannis (2024) and by Sibande et al. (2024) borrow a relatively recent technique developed in the literature for monetary policy studies and identify policy shocks through the narrative method. In addition, virtually all papers are preoccupied with tackling issues of reverse causality between dependent and independent variables, typical in this strand of literature, and therefore engage with several robustness checks and econometric exercises to improve the reliability of the estimates. Let us now turn attention to the research contributions of this special issue. The first part of this collection of articles focuses on the lending implications of tighter bank regulation. In 'The impact of Basel III implementation on bank lending in South Africa', Xolani Sibande and Alistair Milne examine whether minimum capital requirements affect the volume of bank lending. Their paper estimates panel fixed effects and local projections using monthly balance sheet data in the period 2023–2019 for the four largest South African banks—which, given the sector's high concentration, account for over 90% of banks' total assets. The authors further distinguish between types of borrower and loans but find a significant effect—small and negative—only on secured credit for non-financial firms. One reason for lending not to be impacted by minimum equity, the paper supposes, is that large banks operate with large buffers in any case. Neryvia Pillay and Konstantin Makrelov investigate whether bank's capital holdings above minimum requirements—usually raised in response to growing economic and financial risks—affect credit supply. By gaining access to a unique, non-publicly available database of banks' balance sheets, the authors of this study derive a measure of excess capital for each bank in the sample and then show that it significantly reduces bank lending, especially for smaller banks. Pillay and Makrelov's result is markedly different from Sibande and Milne's: Does it imply that the bank capital–lending negative relationship is driven by voluntary capital buffers and small banks drive? Serena Merrino, Keagile Lesame and Ilias Chondrogiannis propose an alternative perspective to evaluate the policy effectiveness, which focuses on the distribution, rather than the volume, of lending. By employing yet another methodological approach and an extremely rich set of data—namely, firm-level tax administrative data and households' borrowing by income bracket—this paper finds that tighter regulation reduced household debt, especially if poor, to the benefit of firms, especially if large. Their findings reveal a mixed policy effectiveness: If the policy-induced reduction in consumer loans is beneficial to financial stability, the authors also point at suboptimal ways in which finance is being reallocated across borrowing firms. The other paper in the series with a focus on corporate finance was produced by Tesfaye Lemma, Michael Machokoto and Tendai Gwatidzo. This research analyses data from 432 non-financial firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2011–2015. It uses a difference-in-differences methodology to compare 'constrained' vs. 'unconstrained' firms before and after Basel III implementation; the authors find that constrained firms (i.e., younger and smaller) reduced their debt exposure and maturity relatively more, echoing the results of the previous study. In the next article, Sibande and co-authors go a step further into the assessment of an alleged stability-inclusion policy trade-off. Their approach is based on identifying the effect of both macroprudential and financially inclusive policy actions on lending rates and volumes for different customer segments, exploiting the disaggregation level of bank balance sheets. Their model reveals that financial inclusion initiatives do not offset, but they rather overlap, macroprudential measures: In other words, regulatory changes that aim at improving financial access for marginal customers are instead increasing the cost and lowering the volume of unsecured loans. Tendai Gwatidzo and Witness Simbanegawi also examine financial inclusion, but their focus lies on the role that competition plays in expanding the outreach of financial service providers. They adopt a pseudo-panel method that relies, among others, on survey data from the World Bank and document that the increased degree of bank competition observed in South Africa over the period 2011–2017 adversely affected financial inclusion. They conclude that in South Africa, larger banks are better positioned for investing into monitoring and information collection that reduce asymmetries, enabling them to develop tailored products for marginal market segments. The last part of this issue consists of two contributions that explore the dynamics of bank performance in South Africa. Tendai Gwatidzo's paper examines how bank profitability has been influenced by the post-crisis regulatory wave. His results depend on the measure: Notably, he identifies enhanced market discipline and activity restrictions (e.g., investment banking) as beneficial to bank performance. Finally, the concluding article—authored by John O. S. Wilson, Linh Nguyen, Anna Sobiech and Lechedzani Kgari—builds a taxonomy of South African banks' business models using clustering algorithms based on balance sheet composition and analyse the evolution of the sector from 1993 to 2022. The research finds that bank business models in South Africa exhibit relative stability over time. Although the paper does not provide explicit conclusions about the overall impact on financial stability, these findings suggest that the evolution of bank business models in South Africa has likely contributed to a relatively stable financial system. The moderate pace of change, diversity of models and stability of many banks' strategies all point towards a banking sector that adapts to changing conditions without frequent drastic shifts that could threaten stability. South Africa's timely and full compliance to Basel's reforms has granted the research community sufficient time to collate information and produce new evidence on the banking sector and regulatory overhaul, as well as its unforeseen consequences and heterogeneous effects. By doing so, the research herein also offers practical and targeted insights for policymakers that take explicit account of the nation's economic objectives and the trade-off between the costs of financial instability and the costs of undesired effects. While acknowledging the importance of evidence-based assessments of the current policy calibration, it is also crucial to recognise that informed decision-making processes can only be supported through a constant pursuit of up-to-date analysis. The ever-changing nature of the financial landscape urges continuous research efforts to navigate market developments safely. During the time this body of research was produced, for example, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank prompted the US Federal Reserve's endgame proposal for more draconian bank capitalisation and, thus, reignited the dissent over the optimal level of regulation. In South Africa, further research advancements are currently constrained by limitations in microeconomic data availability. We believe that two areas need particular attention: non-bank financial institutions, which are growing in size and scope, and borrowers, whose heterogeneous features offer a rich pool of information to study market dynamics. A crucial step towards addressing this gap would be the development of a centralised credit registry, which would provide researchers with detailed, loan-level information, enabling more nuanced analyses of lending patterns, risk profiles, and the transmission of shocks—as realised in many countries already, such as Spain and Italy but also Colombia and Brazil. One last thought. By releasing this special issue, our intention is not only to shed light on the functioning of South Africa's banking sector under Basel III but also to spur further dialogue between the academic community, policymakers and civil society. It is only by continuous discussion and questioning that we can prepare for the arduous task of designing a regulatory environment fit for the future. The evolution of the South African economy, and the well-being of its people, depends on the ways financial agents will shape and adapt to the challenges of the future: The green transition, the physical risk of weather extremes, the disruptions and losses caused by wars and geopolitical tensions are only some of the possible forces that will impact our lives. We hope therefore to provide an opportunity to reflect broadly on the role that financial institutions and regulators can play in preserving economic prosperity and social cohesion despite an uncertain future.

"Trends and Reversion in Financial Markets on Time Scales from Minutes to
  Decades","We empirically analyze the reversion of financial market trends with time horizons ranging from minutes to decades. The analysis covers equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities and combines 14 years of futures tick data, 30 years of daily futures prices, 330 years of monthly asset prices, and yearly financial data since medieval times. Across asset classes, we find that markets are in a trending regime on time scales that range from a few hours to a few years, while they are in a reversion regime on shorter and longer time scales. In the trending regime, weak trends tend to persist, which can be explained by herding behavior of investors. However, in this regime trends tend to revert before they become strong enough to be statistically significant, which can be interpreted as a return of asset prices to their intrinsic value. In the reversion regime, we find the opposite pattern: weak trends tend to revert, while those trends that become statistically significant tend to persist. Our results provide a set of empirical tests of theoretical models of financial markets. We interpret them in the light of a recently proposed lattice gas model, where the lattice represents the social network of traders, the gas molecules represent the shares of financial assets, and efficient markets correspond to the critical point. If this model is accurate, the lattice gas must be near this critical point on time scales from 1 hour to a few days, with a correlation time of a few years.",2025-01-28,
ChatGPT and Commodity Return,"ABSTRACT This paper investigates the ability of a ChatGPT‐based indicator to forecast excess returns of the commodity futures index. Using ChatGPT to extract information from over 2.5 million articles from nine international newspapers, we demonstrate that our constructed commodity news ratio index significantly predicts future commodity returns, both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample. Furthermore, it outperforms traditional textual analysis methods, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Bag‐of‐Words (BoW), while indicating economic significance within an asset allocation framework. The results highlight the critical role of ChatGPT in forecasting commodity market dynamics and provide valuable insights for both financial market participants and researchers.",2025-01-27,
"An Analysis of the Interdependence Between Peanut and Other Agricultural
  Commodities in China's Futures Market","This study analyzes historical data from five agricultural commodities in the Chinese futures market to explore the correlation, cointegration, and Granger causality between Peanut futures and related futures. Multivariate linear regression models are constructed for prices and logarithmic returns, while dynamic relationships are examined using VAR and DCC-EGARCH models. The results reveal a significant dynamic linkage between Peanut and Soybean Oil futures through DCC-EGARCH, whereas the VAR model suggests limited influence from other futures. Additionally, the application of MLP, CNN, and LSTM neural networks for price prediction highlights the critical role of time step configurations in forecasting accuracy. These findings provide valuable insights into the interconnectedness of agricultural futures markets and the efficacy of advanced modeling techniques in financial analysis.",2025-01-27,
The system of criteria and indicators for assessing the efficiency of large-scale agricultural production placement (national and regional levels),"One of the reasons for the low efficiency of large-scale agroindustrial enterprise development is the imperfection of the system of land use and location of agricultural organizations. In modern socio-economic conditions, excessive concentration of land resources at some enterprises that do not have sufficient production potential for their use, and lack of land at others that lack their own fodder land, leads to significant losses for the national economy, deterioration of financial performance of large-commodity agroindustrial enterprises. This study presents a balanced system of criteria and indicators for assessing the efficiency of large-scale agricultural production location (national and regional levels). Four zones of production efficiency are singled out, the optimal sizes of large-scale crop production are established, and a mechanism for identifying inefficiently used land plots of insolvent large agricultural enterprises is proposed. The relevance and novelty of this system lies in the development of tools to assess the efficiency of large-scale agroindustrial enterprise location within the framework of multi-structure agricultural production, taking into account the current organizational and economic conditions.",2025-01-27,
Subverting speculative urbanism: Cityscape in <i>New York 2140</i>,"This article is divided into two parts. The first part foregrounds the logic of contemporary financial capitalism, emphasising the increasing role of ‘speculative urbanism’ in urban transformation. While the literature on the ‘financialisation of the city’ often highlights the commodity as the paradigmatic social form in urban settings, I argue that this perspective no longer fully captures the dynamics of contemporary capitalism. The second part contends that urban studies can significantly benefit from engaging with speculative fiction. Through its imaginative and projective capacities, speculative fiction mirrors empirical social and technological trends, while also illuminating the logical and structural relationship between speculative financialisation and urbanisation. Analysing Kim Stanley Robinson’s New York 2140, the article demonstrates how the novel helps us understand the devastation caused by financial capital, while also presenting a city where people engage in horizontal forms of resistance against speculative urbanism. Ultimately, the article proposes that for urban studies to develop a pertinent theory of futures in the 21st century, it must engage deeply with the mechanisms of speculative financial capitalism and incorporate the critical potential of speculative fiction to analyse and understand speculation as a key aspect of financial capitalism, while uncovering suppressed contradictions and potentialities.",2025-01-24,
Oil Shocks and the Financial Markets: A Review,"ABSTRACT Leading to enormous effects on the global financial markets, oil shocks have received full attention from academic literature. The objective of this survey is to organize and consolidate existing theoretical and empirical research on oil shocks and financial markets, with the goal of uncovering potential areas for future investigation. The paper begins with a brief overview of oil shocks against a historical background, and makes a summarized survey of the existing literature regarding oil shocks. Then this paper discusses the underlying sources of the oil shocks and then turns to make a review of the connections between oil shocks and the economy, the stock market, and the commodity market. The paper concludes with recommendations for subsequent research endeavors, and hopes to facilitate further research in the many strands of the oil shocks‐related literature.",2025-01-23,
Оценка стоимости публичных акционерных обществ сырьевого сектора в условиях санкционного давления,"В данной статье приводятся результаты оценки стоимости публичных акционерных обществ сырьевого сектора на основе финансовой отчетности с января 2019 года по декабрь 2022 года. Актуальность работы обусловлена резким изменением экономической ситуации с момента начала специальной военной операции, вызванного беспрецедентным усилением санкционного давления со стороны недружественных стран и связанным с этим изменением ситуации на отечественном фондовом рынке. В работе оценка справедливой стоимости компаний проводится методом дисконтированного денежного потока. В качестве денежного потока используется свободный денежный поток фирмы. За ставку дисконтирования берётся средневзвешенная стоимость капитала, для оценки стоимости привлечения собственного капитала применяется модель ценообразования капитальных активов, для оценки стоимости заемного капитала используется синтетический рейтинг. Для оценки роста компании применяются драйверы роста: ставка реинвестирования и доходность капитала компании. В результате проведенной оценки была обнаружена недооценка стоимости отечественных компаний сырьевого сектора на начало 2023 года. Итоги исследования позволяют сделать вывод об устойчивости компаний указанного сектора экономики к антироссийском санкциям на конец исследуемого периода и пессимистичности ожиданий отечественного фондового рынка относительно будущей доходности исследуемых компаний. This article presents the results of a valuation of public joint-stock companies in the commodities sector based on financial statements from January 2019 to December 2022. The relevance of this work stems from the sharp change in the economic situation since the start of the special military operation, caused by unprecedented sanctions pressure from unfriendly countries and the related changes in the domestic stock market. The fair value of the companies is assessed using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) is used as the cash flow. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used as the discount rate. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is used to estimate the cost of equity, and a synthetic rating is used to estimate the cost of debt. Company growth is estimated using growth drivers: the reinvestment rate and the company's return on capital. The valuation revealed an undervaluation of domestic commodity sector companies at the beginning of 2023. The results of the study suggest the resilience of companies in this sector of the economy to anti-Russian sanctions at the end of the period under review and the pessimistic expectations of the domestic stock market regarding the future profitability of the companies studied.",2025-01-23,
"Re-examining money, debt and Islamic banking in the USA","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to challenge the view that there is nothing wrong with fiat money, debt and interest or Islamic banking, by re-examining the monetary performance of the USD, analyzing US economic projections of debt at interest and evaluating the contribution of Islamic banking within a financial system that does not recognize the Shari’ah. Design/methodology/approach This paper constructs gold and commodity price indices from 1792 to 2023 to re-examining the performance of the USD over the long-term; through library, document and content research, analyzes the impact of debt and interest on the US economy and re-examines whether US institutions are offering genuine Islamic financial alternatives. Findings US$1.00 in 1792 is now worth less than US$0.01 in 2023. The monetary balance sheet of the USD is now 97% backed by debt. Within the next 10 years, the USA will be unable to service its debt. There has been no progress in Islamic banking in the USA, with all products involving risk-free debt transactions priced at interest. Research limitations/implications By adopting a monetary theory of value, the devaluation of the USD resulted in increased prices due to the debt-based fiat standard and an exponential increase in public debt and interest. Practical implications The USD and the US economy are unsustainable in the long term, and US Islamic banks should transform into Islamic investment managers. Social implications Muslims should create and preserve wealth through genuine Islamic intermediation based on Islamic partnerships and Islamic social finance. Originality/value The US fiat standard is debt organized into currency, which is exponentially increasing and confiscating wealth through inflation and transferring it via interest to the banking system. US Islamic banking products replicate the practices of conventional banks.",2025-01-23,
Identifying Abnormal Financial Transactions in E-Commerce: A Financial Statement Fraud Detection Model Using Op-BGRU and Modified Cheetah Optimization,"Innovative cybersecurity developments are required to counteract growing cyber dangers caused by the exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in entrepreneurial settings. This paper presents a method for detecting financial hazards in e-business commodity transactions using DL and CAD models; the goal is to investigate the detection of anomalous financial commodities in e-business. Because of issues with agencies, information asymmetry exists in all aspects of financial status, information, and reports; this poses a significant risk to the long-term viability of business operations and the efficiency of financial markets. This study takes a look at the financial and non-financial statistics of companies listed on the TWSE/TEPx from 2001 to 2019. Out of the 153 companies that were sampled, 51 reported financial statement fraud and 102 did not. To start, the dataset is cleaned up by doing normalization pre-processing. Financial fraud detection models are constructed by first selecting the most important features using the Modified Cheetah Optimizer. Then, the classifying process is carried out using the Optimized Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Op-BGRU) model. From what to can tell from the data, the suggested model performs better than the baseline RNN model across the board. This strategy will help in the fight against cybercrime and is a big step in the right direction toward arming entrepreneurs with the resources they need to thrive in the modern digital world. A safe, creative, and informed startup setting is what you get when you use sustainable IoT security measures.

International Price Shocks and Financial Soundness: The Impact of Government Policies – A Systematic Review,"This chapter further investigates whether a surge in international commodity resources serves as a “godsend” or a “misfortune” for the financial markets of various nations. By using a systematic review approach, we focus on examining the relationship among three factors: (1) the growth of a country’s financial market in response to (2) an international price shock and (3) the government’s role in mitigating these shocks. Our analysis reveals that, even when accounting for institutional quality and the financial system’s capacity, an increase in resource windfall generally improves the overall health of financial markets, though it also introduces certain short-term vulnerabilities. Notably, we evaluate the role of macroprudential policies in response to these shocks and discover that strategies, such as cautious loan restrictions, financial liberalization, and capital preservation, effectively mitigate short-term risks during significant price changes, regardless of whether these changes are favorable or unfavorable. In summary, our findings, which remain robust across multiple tests, align more closely with the “new trade” theory rather than the notion of a “resource curse.”",2025-01-22,
The impact of Islamic finance on global asset and liability management practices,"Islamic finance, based on Sharia principles that prohibit interest (riba), excessive uncertainty (Gharar), and unethical investments, offers an alternative approach to asset and liability management (ALM) that has gained increasing attention in the global financial system. This review explores the impact of Islamic finance on global ALM practices, focusing on how its unique principles shape financial strategies, risk management, and liquidity structures. In contrast to conventional finance, which relies heavily on interest-bearing instruments, Islamic finance emphasizes asset-backed financing, profit-sharing, and risk-sharing mechanisms. The review discusses how Islamic financial institutions manage their assets and liabilities using Sharia-compliant products such as Murabaha (cost-plus financing), Mudarabah (profit-sharing), Musharakah (joint venture), and Sukuk (Islamic bonds). These products align with the principles of risk-sharing and ethical investment, leading to distinct ALM strategies that emphasize the importance of tangible assets and real economic activity. Unlike conventional derivatives that are often used for hedging, Islamic finance promotes alternative risk management techniques such as Tawarruq (commodity-based hedging) and Wa’ad (unilateral promises), which avoid speculation and excessive uncertainty. The review also examines how Islamic finance contributes to diversification in global ALM practices, especially in markets with significant Islamic investor bases, such as the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The growing adoption of Islamic financial instruments by conventional financial institutions further demonstrates the integration of Islamic principles into mainstream ALM practices. Islamic finance has a transformative effect on global ALM practices by providing ethical, asset-backed alternatives that promote stability, transparency, and sustainability. Its integration into the global financial system not only expands the range of financial products available but also introduces a more inclusive, risk-sharing approach to managing assets and liabilities.

"Geopolitical Shocks and Market Resilience: Evidence from Commodity, Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Gold Markets","Amid heightened geopolitical risk (GPR) shocks this study empirically investigates the dynamic interconnectedness among key commodities—namely crude oil, natural gas, and gold markets—to evaluate their potential resilience to unfolding crises, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Middle Eastern supply chain disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing global economic recession. Utilizing a comprehensive daily dataset spanning January 2, 2008, to November 30, 2024, this research examines a significant time period that encompasses multiple global and regional financial crises. For empirical validation, the study employs the advanced econometric framework of TVP-VAR modeling. The findings reveal that commodity indices and gold primarily function as transmitters of volatility and spillovers, while the crude oil and natural gas—serves as the principal recipient of external shocks. The results from net—spillover estimation highlight that GPR, especially those arising from the United States and Russian Federations exert a more pronounced influence on the interconnectedness of commodity markets compared to GPR at global-level. This study observed that net volatility spillovers varies across underlined markets where GPR-Russ found to negatively influence net spillovers in the energy sector, while exerting a positive effect on gold markets. The study provides practical market—based insights for policymakers, investors, and stakeholders seeking to navigate periods of uncertainty where this study underscores the critical role of global and regional GPR in shaping the interconnected dynamics of global commodity markets.",2025-01-20,
"""Winter is Coming"": Analysis of Crowdfunding's Future as FinTech Struggles","This study examines the transformative potential of FinTech, particularly crowdfunding, in the context of traditional financial systems, even amid the current FinTech market downturn (&amp;#039;Winter&amp;#039;). We address a fundamental question: Does crowdfunding represent a viable alternative to conventional finance, or does it merely function as an extension of existing financial infrastructure? To investigate this relationship empirically, we developed a proprietary crowdfunding index and employed Diebold and Yilmaz (2012; 2014)&amp;#039;s Interconnectedness Index methodology to compare the spillover effects of crowdfunding and traditional financial systems with common economic factors such as interest rates, USD index, economic uncertainty, cryptocurrency (Bitcoin,) as well as commodities (gold and oil). Despite crowdfunding&amp;#039;s remarkable growth trajectory over the past decade, our empirical evidence indicates that it has not yet emerged as a viable substitute for conventional financial mechanisms. These findings carry substantial implications for regulatory frameworks, industry stakeholders, and academic discourse, contributing to the broader understanding of FinTech&amp;#039;s disruptive capacity within the financial ecosystem.",2025-01-20,
Challenges and Future Scope in Onion and Other Root Crop De-Topping Machines and Its Performance: A Review,"Onion is one of the important vegetable and spice commodity crop which has yearlong demand but seasonal in production. Onion de-topping (i.e., separation of matured leaves from bulbs) is the important post-harvest operation in onion production which conducted after curing process of onion bulbs. In India onion de-topping done mostly manually in farms using sickle, khurpi and knife. Manually onion de-topping of onion bulbs is time consuming and labour-intensive operation. Availability of labours are difficult in peak harvesting season of onion; therefore, farmers may incur financial and crop loss. Mechanical onion de-topping done using onion harvesters during digging operation of onion bulbs. There are many onion de-topping machines are available for onion bulbs with different mechanism. The different onion de-topping machine were studied in terms of their mechanism, construction, working principles, performance and efficiency. The comparison of performance of the machines with manual onion de-topping was studied over the cutting capacity, efficiency, damage percentage, saving of labour cost and time. This paper reviews such onion de-topping harvesters and de-topping machines. It highlights the mechanism used for de-topping in these machines with their performance in terms of de-topping capacity and de-topping efficiency. It also tries to highlight the necessity of requirement of de-topping machines and current status of adoption of such machines by farmers in India. It was observed that number of onion de-topping machines are available though it is difficult to adopt by the farmers specially medium and low land holding farmers because of cost concern. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the machine which should be low cost, efficient and labour saving for such farmers. Using such an onion de-topping machines will help to save their labour cost, operational time, drudgery of labour and increase efficiency of labour. Also adopting such technologies can encourage the farmers to increase the production of such crop.",2025-01-18,
Beyond the Buzz: A Measured Look at Bitcoin’s Viability as Money,"This paper examines Bitcoin’s viability as money through the lens of its risk profile, with a particular focus on its store of value function. We employ a suite of wavelet techniques, including Wavelet Transform (WT), Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC), Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC), and Partial Wavelet Coherence (PWC), to decompose the risk structure of Bitcoin and analyze its relationship with various systematic risk factors. Our dataset spans from 13 August 2015 to 29 June 2024, and includes Bitcoin, major commodities, global and US equities, Shari’ah-compliant equities, Ethereum, and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). We find that Bitcoin’s risk profile is increasingly aligned with traditional financial assets, indicating growing market integration. While Bitcoin exhibits high volatility, a significant portion of this volatility can be attributed to systematic rather than idiosyncratic factors. This suggests that Bitcoin’s risk may be more diversifiable than previously thought. Our findings have important implications for monetary policy and financial regulation, challenging the notion that Bitcoin’s volatility precludes its use as money and suggesting that regulatory approaches should consider Bitcoin’s evolving risk characteristics and increasing integration with broader financial markets.",2025-01-17,
AgentOptimiser for Prompting Large Language Models In Finance,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks [2], but depending on use case, they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort to perfect or find optimal prompting given the task. Building on suggestions from EvoPrompt that seek to explore the search space of LLM prompting using Genetic Algorithms [9], we introduce AgentOptimiser, which leverages a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. We empower the agents to optimise prompting by passing a Q-table-like structure that manages state, enabling the LLM to track accuracy measures and corresponding historical prompting. We then seek to enable the model to explore the prompt and temperature space. We find that the AgentOptimiser-optimised GPT-4 variant outperforms other fine-tuned transformer models and vanilla few-shot GPT-4 performance on our commodity news-specific test set. We outline additional opportunities to continue and improve this work. The inclusion of the temperature parameterisation increases the optimisation search space; by introducing a generational fitness function, we increase our model's performance. We outline areas of future research to explore additional metaheuristic approaches that could be explored to better manage the exploration-exploitation trade-off to guide LLM agent task-specific optimisation in financial engineering.",2025-01-17,
Dynamic linkages and spillover effects of biodiversity risk in socially responsible investment and commodity markets,"This study employs a novel biodiversity risk measure, developed through textual analysis, to examine how biodiversity risk affects socially responsible investment (SRI) and commodity markets. Biodiversity-related financial risks, arising from ecosystem degradation, represent an emerging and underexplored dimension of market risk, particularly for investors seeking sustainability-aligned portfolios. Our analysis reveals that both SRI equity and commodity indices consistently exhibit negative time-varying correlations with biodiversity risk, with correlations as low as -0.62 for the FTSE4Good US 100 and -0.53 for the FTSE4Good Global 100. Similarly, commodities like silver, gold, crude oil, and wheat also show negative correlations with biodiversity risk. These findings indicate that neither asset class serves as a reliable hedge against biodiversity-related shocks. Furthermore, biodiversity risk has a significant long-term spillover effect on SRI equity and commodity market returns. As biodiversity risk increases, it strengthens the connectedness between these markets, thereby amplifying the transmission of risk across them. These findings highlight the need for new risk management strategies and regulatory frameworks that account for biodiversity risk, opening new research pathways in finance and environmental sustainability.",2025-01-17,
"A Positive, Pro‐Active Vision for Rehumanizing Higher Education","My (Laura's) vision for this monograph was born of despair. Like many in academia, I have been watching higher education become a shadow of its former self through ruthless budget cuts, gutting of humanities departments, and attacks on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Not a quitter by nature, I have tried to do my small part to fight these negative forces. Working harder has been an effective strategy for me in many things, but it did not seem to help with this particular problem. Maybe it was inevitable, then, that I would turn to two of the most positive people I know for help in moving from despair to hope. Pete Mather has been my friend and colleague for over a decade and always has a knack for starting with what is working and building from there. Samba Bah has been my Graduate Assistant for a year and a half and possesses a gift for eschewing isolation in favor of community. Together, the three of us crafted a vision rooted in love for what higher education was, is, and can be when centered on human development. We sought and found an incredible array of contributing authors whose voices provide uplift through creative ideas and concrete strategies. I open this monograph with a bit about the personal and academic experiences that formed my thinking on the idea of rehumanizing higher education, then introduce my fellow authors whose words offer direction for getting there. I entered college broken. My mom had died recently. I had no siblings. At 18, I felt alone. Lacking guidance, I only chose Ohio University because I had a friend who was going there. By the time we actually moved to campus, we were no longer friends in that mysterious way teenage girl relationships could end without any real reason. I did not have what you would call a strong support network when I embarked on my college journey. And yet I wielded a secret weapon that I only recently realized I had. It is not what you would expect. It is not character. I lacked both Carol Dwecks (2006) growth mindset and Angela Duckworths (2013) grit. I had some privilege, being White and middle class, but plenty of students with these advantages still give up when they feel alienated. The reason I did not give up is because I had won the time lottery, though I did not realize it until much later in life. When I say I won the time lottery, I mean I arrived on campus in 1991. I got to be in college back when faculty and staff had time for students, even at large, public, non-selective institutions such as the one I attended. My first campus job was in a dining hall, where most of my shifts involved pulling hard plastic dishes out of the Hobart. I stood on a thick rubber mat where I learned how to hold the hotter-than-hell dishes just long enough to neither burn myself nor drop them. I learned that skill on my own. I learned more interesting things from Maggie, the student worker supervisor. Maggie would frequently come back to the kitchen and talk to the other students and me about our lives, asking us the regular questions about classes and so forth while we stacked dishes and sorted silverware. She talked to us about her life, too, regular stuff like dating and money. Having no smartphone to which to attend, Maggie made eye contact with us when we conversed. She did not worry about the emails piling up because, like I said, it was 1991. My exchanges with Maggie taught me how to express myself in the workplace, striking a balance between stilted professionalism and oversharing. Also, Maggie's interest in us created that sense of belonging so crucial to student success (Strayhorn 2018). I benefited from even more adult investment in my next campus job working in residence life. My various supervisors met with student staff individually for 1–2 h every week, teaching and mentoring us with incredible care. I did not have this experience as consistently with faculty, but I did frequently encounter professors who made an effort to get to know me. Over 4 years, these experiences of being known and seen made me better. I left college mostly healed and no longer alone, a success story for me and a positive for my university's retention and graduation numbers. Now a professor at this same institution, I teach a helping skills course in our program in which I have many occasions to share these stories with my students. I have only recently begun to notice the incredulous look most students give when I talk about all the adult attention I received as a student. It is not that faculty and staff today do not want to pay attention to students; in fact, I suspect most of us would rather have a meaningful conversation with a student than attend a meeting, answer an email, or do one of the other countless tasks that get in the way of this essential work. We are simply busier now than people were in 1991. By ""busier,"" I mean neither ""harder working,"" nor ""more productive."" I sense people worked just as hard back then and were maybe even more productive depending on the metric one uses. I posit now we are just busier spiraling between endless meetings and emails and demands for enrollment numbers on various spreadsheets. If these things resulted in a robust and sustainable higher education system held in esteem by the public it was charged to serve, maybe we would have to accept this situation and admonish those who oppose it as resistant to change. But, as we know, it is not working and that should create a window of opportunity to challenge the dehumanizing consumerist status quo ethos of higher education. Public support for higher education continues to decrease when we treat students like commodities. Yet the conventional wisdom is that we should cling to this failed vision; in fact, anyone who opposes it is cast as a starry-eyed dreamer. When I suggest that enrolling more students while cutting faculty positions might diminish our whole purpose for being here, I am met with eye rolls. ""More butts in seats, less hearts and minds, please,"" is essentially what I hear. Nearly every piece of research—my own and the large body of what can be broadly categorized as the student success literature—points to caring faculty and staff as the single most significant factor in retention and graduation (Astin 1993; Harrison and Mathuews 2022; Rendón and Muñoz 2011; Tinto 1975). Yet what are we told to spend our time on? Meetings, emails, and spreadsheets. The party line is that meetings, emails, and spreadsheets lead to that all-important goal of efficiency. But what if we have reached a point where all this efficiency is standing in the way of effectiveness? One of Martin Luther King's less quoted insights captures his prophetic concern about this point. Working for the Morehouse College student newspaper, The Maroon Tiger, an 18-year-old Martin Luther King Junior wrote, ""Education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society."" I argue that contemporary students are victims of this efficiency menace. For all the claims that young people today are pampered snowflakes, they receive shockingly little real attention. I am not saying students lack resources; in fact, there are many more campus offices and support personnel now than when I was a student. But unless the people in these offices have the time and bandwidth needed to provide substantive and sustained care, they can miss the mark when it comes to providing what educational psychologist, Nel Noddings, called an ethic of care. We establish funds, or institutions, or agencies in order to provide the caretaking we judge to be necessary. The original impulse is often the one associated with caring. It arises in individuals. But as groups of individuals discuss the perceived needs of another individual or group, the imperative changes from ""I must do something"" to ""Something must be done."" This change is accompanied by a shift from the nonrational and subjective to the rational and objective. What should be done? Who should do it? Why should the persons named do it? This sort of thinking is not in itself a mistake; it is needed. But it has buried within it the seed of major error. The danger is that caring, which is essentially nonrational in that it requires a constitutive engrossment and displacement of motivation, may gradually or abruptly be transformed into abstract problem solving. There is, then, a shift of focus from the cared-for to the ""problem"" (p.25). I'm afraid that the transformation to which Noddings refers is happening on today's college campuses where efficiency has eclipsed effectiveness. We are letting the ""butts in seats"" mentality drive too much of what we do. The mere suggestion that other priorities have a place in higher education too often elicits protests about practicality. We must stop letting the naysayers shut down assertions that fostering caring relationships is worthy of human and financial resource investment. As Peter Felton and Leo Lambert showed in their book, Relationship Rich Education: How Human Connections Drive Success in College, meaningful relationships are crucial for student success. They turn the practicality question on its head, arguing, ""Even when budgets are tights, tensions, are high, and calendars are full, higher education's guiding question should not be Can we afford to prioritize relationship rich education? but rather Can we afford not to prioritize it?"" (p.5). Felton and Lambert's (2020) words challenge us to move beyond the false dichotomy between what is right and what is pragmatic. Re-centering human interaction is both the ethical and practical path forward if we are to find a way out of what ails contemporary higher education. Continuing to double down on the same depersonalized, bureaucratic, managerial systems that created the problem makes no sense if we truly want to chart a better course. The first step is to refuse the taken-for-granted assumptions behind the ""higher education should be run like a business"" ethos. Again, if that philosophy worked, we might be stuck with it. Since it is not working, however, we should feel free to operate from different assumptions. This paradigm shift requires moving from an oppositional stance to one that articulates more clearly what we are for. In the following section, I posit a starting point for this process of moving from defensiveness to a spirit of pro-activeness. Moving from a ""butts in seats"" to an ""ethic of care"" sensibility will require both ideological and systemic recalibrations. We can start by rejecting the false dichotomy that care and practical concerns are at odds. We can also push back on the busy work that inhibits our ability to practice an ethic of care with students. I acknowledge there is a power element to that last assertation, one I am privileged to enjoy as a tenured faculty member. And we absolutely must advocate for the kind of systemic change needed to inculcate relationship-rich education. But as we also know, systemic change takes a long time and there are students in front of us right now. So even small pushbacks to the ""butts in seats"" mentality are important in turning our eyes from our screens to our students. Within the philosophy of Romanticism, the purpose of life is to free yourself from the confines of civilization. Find yourself in freedom and exploration. Passion, intuition, direct perception, and experience are privileged over reductionistic reason. Life is about the search for awe, or what the Romantics called the sublime. (Keltner 2023, p.122) What might be the features of a Rehumanizing Revolution in Higher Education? While an exhaustive list is beyond the scope of this piece, I propose a few potential starting points. Like the Romantic Era thinkers, we find ourselves at a moment when technological developments both enchant and diminish us. When the Industrial Revolution began, individuals who worked as crafts- or trades-people found themselves transported to factories where they operated as cogs in machines (Shafritz, Ott, and Jang 2015). Similarly, we find ourselves displaced by machines that are not simply neutral tools, but that change us in ways that are potentially dehumanizing (Foer 2017). For example, Turkle (2016) documented care work being carried out by artificial intelligence (AI) in nursing homes where companion robots stand in for human visitors. She rightly points out that there is a difference between using robots for functions like medicine distribution and outsourcing the love and care that should belong firmly in the human realm. The tech-positive narrative encourages us to dismiss stories like this, arguing that we enjoy technology's many benefits and would not want to throw the proverbial baby out with the bath water. In Digital Minimalism, Newport (2019) articulated a much-needed position showing that it is possible to simultaneously incorporate technology that serves our human values while rejecting that which sucks down our time, energy, and/or humanity. We believe rehumanizing education demands thought leadership in the spirit of Newport's assertion; this is why many of the pieces in this volume tackle some of the most pressing issues in this vein. In Newport's (2016) previous book, Deep Work, he made the case that the need for time and space to do one's best work is more important now that we no longer compete with local talent pools. Given the rise of remote work and AI, the pressure to cultivate one's unique talents is higher than ever as hiring entities have many more human and machine options than ever before. Working at the frontiers of one's abilities demands concentration and focus, states that are impossible to achieve when constantly digitally distracted. Again, tech enthusiasts jump on this kind of assertion by rattling off lists of widely enjoyed technological advances in an effort to cast critics as hypocrites for using computers instead of typewriters or stone tablets. I argue that rehumanizing education necessitates exposing these kinds of false dichotomies and engaging in thoughtful analyses of technology's contributions and excesses. Instead of asking the same tired questions about whether we would prefer to write on typewriters, what if we asked questions about how some restraint around the rollout of social media might have preempted some if its uglier side effects? Humanistic higher education leaders can and should play a leadership role in raising these questions about AI's effects in our world today. Thought leadership around AI's dehumanizing consequences is particularly important in light of its power to exacerbate and further systematize existing injustices. From facial recognition technology that confuses Black faces with apes to language detection software that disproportionately ascribes violent meaning to Arabic speech, the seemingly neutral algorithms that increasingly dominate our lives turn out to be incredibly biased (Gebru 2020). The obvious argument is that humans are also biased, but we can mitigate one another's biases in ways beyond the capacity of soulless machines. Eubanks (2018) provided a powerful analysis of this issue in her study of social services entities' transition from human case workers to automated systems. The machines could not account for nuance, make judgment calls, or provide personalized help in their cold and rigid calculations, resulting in people losing desperately needed assistance and being re-traumatized in the process. Not only did automated systems denigrate the clients they were charged to serve, they added another layer of administrative minutia. Automation failed so spectacularly to live up to the promise of efficiency that many agencies quietly returned to human case workers. The perfect machines could not deliver the services handled by the imperfect people not because they lacked efficiency, but because they lacked the ability to adjust across contexts, a talent asserts as uniquely human (Epstein 2021). My point is not that higher education ought to eschew AI; my point is that we should not let it eclipse our fundamental reason for being cultivators of human capacity. I would think the development of human capacity would be an uncontroversial ideal, but there are those who envision a future where people live like pampered pets while outsourcing their work to robots (Gibbs 2015). When I first read this idea, it reminded me of an experience I had as a child at Sea World. As I gazed at the majestic whales in their tank, I wondered whether this could really be a satisfying life for them. I asked one of the employees, who assured me that the whales were happy. I remember him being friendly and kind, making the effort to stoop down and look me in the eye as he said something along the lines of, ""Whales in the wild can only dream about this kind of food security. And look at all the other animals who can just relax and not worry about being eaten by predators. They're all living the life here at Sea World!"" I wanted to believe him. And yet some small part of me knew even then that he was wrong. I could not have articulated it at the time, but I had a sense that being fully alive was bigger than comfort. I had a sense that hunting is part of what makes a whale a whale and not a household pet or inanimate object. I think a similar parallel can be drawn between human beings and work. By ""work,"" I do not necessarily mean paid labor. By ""work,"" I mean the human flourishing that results from stretching one's heart and mind. Paradoxically, it is this kind of phenomenon that Somers (2023) wrote about in a piece lamenting how much he missed coding now that this work has been outsourced to AI. Somers experienced coding not simply as a means to an end but as something more akin to a craft that could be carried out with eloquence. This sense of intrinsic motivation is something to which a rehumanized higher education should re-connect after decades of pandering to the idea of universities as simple workforce development machines. This notion has been criticized as romantic and impractical, but, again, the current climate might provide an opportunity to show that it is crude vocationalism that may actually be the impractical idea. In their piece titled, Teaching in an Age of Militant Apathy in Higher Education, McMurtrie (2023) makes a compelling case that today's students do not buy into the idea of college as simply a place to train them for a place in a system they see as broken. Gen Z wants and is frankly demanding an education that speaks to them as whole human beings who need financial security, for sure, but also mental health, meaning, justice, and a sustainable environment. After years of struggling to articulate the value of the humanities in a higher education system hyper-focused on pre-professional majors, I argue the time has come for all of us to uplift the humanities as a necessary part of any meaningful postsecondary education. I confess I still cling to the old faith that culture is vastly more important than politics or some pre-professional training in algorithms and software systems. I'm convinced that consuming culture furnishes your mind with emotional knowledge and wisdom; it helps you take a richer and more meaningful view of your own experiences; it helps you understand, at least a bit, the depths of what's going on in the people right around you… We're overpoliticized while growing increasingly undermoralized, underspiritualized, undercultured. (Brooks 2024, para 5) Wherever we fall on the political spectrum, many are expressing a longing for a more elevated way of being in the community. I would not locate my own politics very close to Brooks', yet his words resonate because they evoke something deeper than memes and soundbites. Of course, memes and soundbites are popular because they are quick at a time when speed is too often valued at the expense of all else. The McDonalds drive-thru may be my fastest path to lunch, but is the food I find there worth ingesting? Might it be worth that extra 5 min to pack a lunch that offers nutrients rather than empty calories? These are the questions I argue higher education should be asking at this moment when the public is questioning its value. Scholars frequently express concern about the de-emphasis on critical thinking in higher education, a sentiment with which I agree. For example, developing an informed position, acknowledging different points of view, and assessing the credibility of courses are important skills for functioning as informed citizens in a democracy. The diminished state of discourse in our society demonstrates the costs of under-resourced, inequitable educations systems too driven by vocationalism. Hence critical thinking should be taken more seriously as an integral part of higher education. And yet critical thinking is not the only value we should inculcate in both our college students and structures. Fitzpatrick (2021) asserts that higher education needs what she calls, generous thinking to complement critical thinking. She opens the book with an example of teaching a text to which students reacted by poking holes rather than really engaging with and responding to the work. She calls for generous thinking, defined as ""a mode of engagement that emphasizes listening over speaking, community over individualism, and collaborating over competition"" (p.4). She goes on to assert that critical thinking without generous thinking creates ""a politics that makes inevitable the critical, the negative, the rejection of everything that has gone before"" (p.25). Such a world becomes a bunch of individuals vying for attention through snark and putdowns rather than the beloved community Martin Luther King, Pope Francis, and many other spiritual leaders offer as a positive vision. I wrote this work in an election year when the discourse is often dominated by pro-Trump and anti-Trump sentiment. This framing allows the pro-Trump contingent to control the narrative, putting opponents on the defensive. of what they are for. Yardley (2016) wrote a compelling piece in this vein, framing President Trump and Pope Francis as the world's most powerful leaders embodying truly different values at their core. I found the work fresh and heartening for its positioning of at least two ways of being that are not merely oppositional, but truly their own paths in their own right. I do not agree with everything Pope Francis espouses, but his message of love and compassion resonates and offers a goal to run toward after years of feeling the need to run away. This pro-active vision embodies our hope for this volume, a place where authors move beyond re-hashing problems to envisioning ways to rehumanize higher education, an institution that has its share of problems, but which we ultimately honor with the ideas offered in this monograph.",2025-01-15,
"Matthew C.Canfield, Translating Food Sovereignty: Cultivating Justice in an Age of Transnational Governance, Stanford University Press, 2022, 280 pp, hb US/CAN $105.00, pb US/CAN $26.00","The past few years have presented significant challenges for food and food systems, prompting more lawyers to view food not merely as a health risk requiring regulation and rather as central to the organisation of societies and key to climate action. Matt Canfield's book Translating Food Sovereignty contributes to this ongoing transition of food away from semi-invisibility in the legal horizon and provides lawyers with multiple opportunities to educate themselves on the spaces, notions, and people that constitute transnational food governance. The book's main contribution is twofold. First, we are invited to familiarise ourselves with a vocabulary and conversations imported from food systems studies, sociology, and political economy. Canfield provides us with enough explanations and genealogical accounts to understand concepts that are new to the legal arena but are often deployed in food and agrarian studies. Second, we are offered the opportunity to 'use' food to engage in a systemic reflection of global governance as a 'legally constitutive site of struggle' (10) of opposing visions and aspirations. A central point of friction, and a core element of the book, is the notion of food sovereignty. This is mostly because of the role it has assumed in the rhetoric and praxis of resistance that Indigenous Peoples and civil society organisations are leveraging against the universalisation of a food system that is based on the premises of profit maximisation, financial returns, and hyper-productivism. Canfield presents the notion through its history and the multiple declarations that defined the term since the end of the twentieth century, culminating with the definition adopted by the 2007 Nyéléni International Forum on Food Sovereignty, which is today the most utilised. Then, more than 500 people from 80 countries recognised the Western and modernist origin of the notion of sovereignty and decided to subvert it and redefine it according to a people-based, rather than a state-based, vision. Food sovereignty was thus coined as 'the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems' (48). Its bottom-up and non-institutionalised genealogy is key to understanding its role in ongoing struggles and the importance it may play in legal analysis too, particularly the way in which it complexifies the usual debate about international law and human rights law 'as part of the problem' or 'as part of the solution'. To elucidate the idea of transnational food governance as a 'legally constitutive site of struggle' in which resistance can originate and consolidate, Canfield provides concrete examples, drawing on the research that he conducted among the US and Canadian food sovereignty movements across different geographies. He introduces us to four 'arenas of governance – from local food policy councils to global value chains to transnational networks – through which [food sovereignty movements] articulate holistic social justice claims that are no longer constrained by liberal legalism' (188). The four main chapters of the book offer the reader the chance to dive into the political and legal tensions that characterise these four arenas, from the micro to the macro: the Puget Sound Regional Food Policy Council, the food workers' pickets in Skagit County, the Africa-US Food Sovereignty Strategy Summit, and the Civil Society and Indigenous People Mechanism of the Committee on World Food Security at the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. For each of them, Canfield presents the actors, challenges, and processes, showing in particular the way in which the concept of food sovereignty is translated and operationalised. As expected, these policy arenas – and the networks that operate across them – are far from homogeneous and monolithic. Food sovereignty offers a joint political platform to farmers, workers, movements and Indigenous Peoples to go beyond individualised and fragmented understanding of food as a commodity. It promotes a systemic approach to food systems as inherently political and intertwined with human and ecological processes. In all its translations, food sovereignty requires moving beyond a superficial understanding of food systems as a matter of individual experiences and circulations of goods and requires asking questions of justice, agency and recognition. Law and governance play a significant role in each of these arenas, both as tactical instruments to promote food sovereignty and as obstacles to its achievement. Each example that Canfield draws on offers a unique reflection on the relationship between law, food systems, and food sovereignty. By engaging with the Puget Sound Regional Food Policy Council, Canfield challenges the notion of local food arenas as inherently collaborative spaces, emphasising the intense tensions that can arise when governance is decentralised and different groups advance their own interpretations and visions. In the case of Familias Unidas por la Justicia (FJU) workers, he addresses ongoing discussions on private governance and corporate codes of conduct, highlighting the importance of broad political and cross-chain mobilisation, while also exposing the limitations of 'voluntary' actions. Through the example of the Africa-US Food Sovereignty Strategy Summit and the collective struggle against the commercialisation of the genetically modified 'super banana', Canfield reminds legal scholars of the role that law plays in upholding the privatisation of genetic material. He underscores how legal monopolies often conflict with the principles of self-determination and the rights of peasants, rendering them incompatible with food sovereignty. Finally, the Committee on World Food Security is used by the author to challenge the distinction between global and local governance levels. Canfield provides accounts of 'food sovereignty activists engag[ing] in translocal translation, bringing local knowledge and experiences to the global level, and creating new understandings and strategies for governance back home' (152). Because food is a site of struggle, readers are also warned that translation efforts and the redefinition of transnational governance structures are not an exclusive prerogative of peasants and grassroots organisations. Along with the 'transnational governance from below' of peasants and their allies, Translating Food Sovereignty also introduces 'transnational governance from above' as the increasing effort of some (corporate, financial, and state) actors and international organisations to promote narratives, laws, and policies supporting their vision of the future of food, in contrast with the spirit and goals of food sovereignty. This is happening, for example, with the push towards multistakeholderism to replace multilateralism, data-based governance as (false) solutions to food insecurity, and the appropriation of the notion of food sovereignty by the French and Italian governments to rebrand their agricultural ministries without any real engagement with the structural reforms implied in the peasants' translation of the term. Given the increased participation of lawyers in arenas of food struggle, knowledge of these 'traps' becomes essential. But this is not all that lawyers can learn from the book. At a time when famine, starvation, and the fragilities of the global food system are increasingly discussed in law schools and legal journals, Translating Food Sovereignty uses food to offer a broader reflection on the limits of liberal legalism as 'an ideology of law premised on individual rather than collective rights [that] has constantly served as a stumbling block for generations of social movements seeking egalitarian social change' (4). For Canfield, food and the decision-making processes over food systems are not mere legal objects of analysis, but a 'symbolic and material battleground over neoliberalism' (9), and examining this allows readers to familiarise themselves with the innovative ways in which people are occupying transnational spaces and platforms to engage with law and transnational governance from below, appropriating their tools and vocabulary and developing counter-hegemonic practices and interpretations of the international legal order. By expanding from food systems to the tentacular processes of neoliberalism, Translating Food Sovereignty shows how food sovereignty is not just about producing food but rather about achieving an all-encompassing vision that subverts the patterns of colonialism and racialised capitalism. Peasants' and food workers' control over food systems is thus about building a future that combines human rights, dignity, and self-determination, and does so through food as essential to life. Therefore, it would not be enough to 'translate food sovereignty' into laws and legal structures that remedy starvation, famine, and exceptional violations of human rights. Rather, such a process would require following Susan Marks's suggestion in her seminal 'Human Rights and Root Causes' ((2011) 74 MLR 57) to identify the structural causes of contemporary food misery and challenge structures and systems that reproduce dependency, marginalisation, and socio-ecological oppression. Given the timing and geographical focus of the book, it could not deal with the way in which food sovereignty has recently been adopted by peasants, Indigenous people and food sovereignty activists to challenge what the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, Starvation and the right to food, with an emphasis on the Palestinian people's food sovereignty (United Nations Thematic Report A/79/171, 17 July 2024) at https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/thematic-reports/a79171-starvation-and-right-food-emphasis-palestinian-peoples-food (last visited 16 December 2024) and the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition, Conflict-induced acute food crises: potential policy responses in light of current emergencies (Committee on World Food Security, HLPE Issues Paper, July 2024) at https://www.fao.org/docs/devhlpelibraries/default-document-library/hlpe-fsn-issues-papers_conflicts-and-fsn.pdf?sfvrsn=823378b6_4 [https://perma.cc/DZZ5-A77K] have defined as the weaponisation of food against the Palestinian people, the people of Sudan and other people who are living under illegal or prolonged occupations, wars and conflicts. This happened at the local level, where Indigenous people from all over the world marched and stood in solidarity with the Palestinians, but also at the Committee on World Food Security, where the struggle for food sovereignty described by Canfield has been intertwined with the fight for self-determination and the right to food of peoples under occupation and oppression. Once more, bottom-up organisation, networks and the vocabulary of rights are tactically appropriated and mobilised to achieve the long-term goal of a just food system and a just society. At a time when liberal legalism is showing evident cracks, Canfield's Translating Food Sovereignty challenges socio-legal scholars and practitioners to take food systems as a window into a broader field of counterhegemonic movements and actors that are mobilising law, policy, and governance to respond and move beyond neoliberalism and liberal legality. Through this lens, transnational food governance becomes a powerful heuristic that reveals the flaws and potential within the international legal order and urges action and participation rather than assuming that a just and sustainable future will happen. But it is not all. Transcending the food arena, Canfield's account of the hegemonic and counterhegemonic practices of translation can guide socio-legal scholars in uncovering other epistemic and normative frictions that lie beneath the mechanisms of racialised and financialised capitalism. Translating Food Sovereignty is thus about food, but mostly about how people are exercising their agency, appropriating and mobilising law, and redefining local and global governance processes rather than waiting to be saved by a system that seldom worked for them.",2025-01-15,
Evidence of Financial Market Synergies. A Combined Statistical and Machine Learning Research Approach,"The research investigates how geopolitical conflicts influence global commodities and financial markets, aiming to identify effects on oil companies' economic and financial indicators within the context of financial market synergies. An integrated approach is implemented in the study, combining traditional statistical methods with advanced machine learning techniques. The results of the investigation were analyzed at two distinct levels: (1) that of the evolution of global commodity prices during the conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, and (2) that of the financial performance of 250 companies in the oil industry, summarized in seven key indicators. Eloquent findings indicate that both conflicts have triggered significant changes in commodity prices, with strong investor reactions to safe haven assets such as gold and silver. In addition, there are clear manifestations of behavior reflecting supply-side concerns, as energy prices have risen considerably. Correlation analysis has shown a significant link between upward oil price movements and changes in some financial indicators (such as EBITDA) as well as asset increases. By integrating traditional statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques, the ability of GARCH-ML hybrid models to accurately predict stock index volatility in the context of geopolitical tensions is highlighted. The research results highlight the benefits of the holistic approach in analyzing the complex interconnections between commodity markets, financial markets and company performance.",2025-01-15,
The Determinants of Marginal Convenience Yield in Agricultural Commodity Markets,"Abstract We report a significant downward trend in the convenience yield for holding physical inventory in agricultural commodity futures markets, attributing this negative trend to speculative demand shocks, which in turn, leads in decreasing agricultural convenience yields. Moreover, agricultural convenience yields appear negative on average during the recent financialization (of commodities) period. We additionally show that the response of agricultural convenience yields to commodity price uncertainty and supply shocks is much less pronounced in magnitude and persistence compared to that of hedging demand shocks. Overall, our analysis verifies the Keynesian theory of normal backwardation by showing a long‐lasting positive response of agricultural convenience yields to a hedging demand shock, thereby leaving the hedging demand as the most significant factor explaining the less frequently observed backwardations in agricultural futures markets.",2025-01-14,
"Benefits, challenges, and best practices of collaborative partnerships among health supply chain stakeholders in Rwanda: a cross-sectional study","Strong partnerships, community engagement, and multisectoral collaboration in the health supply chain are synergistic pillars towards achieving universal health coverage. In Rwanda, the health supply chain involves the collaboration of various stakeholders, including distributors, manufacturers, wholesalers, and customers. However, since the eruption and ending of COVID-19, there has not been any study to assess stakeholders' perspectives on the status of the benefits, challenges, and best practices of collaborative partnerships among health supply chain stakeholders in Rwanda. Therefore, this research was conducted to fill that gap in order to devise ways for improved visibility, coordination, and efficiency of the health supply chain management system in Rwanda. This quantitative cross-sectional study, collected data from 11th April to 18th May 2024. It involved 103 respondents from 54 institutions engaged in the management of the health commodities supply chain in Rwanda. These were the Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Center, Rwanda Food and Drugs Authority, Rwanda Medical Supply Ltd, other Central Medical Stores namely Bureau des Formations Médicales Agréées du Rwanda (BUFMAR) and Medical and Allied Service Solutions (MEDIASOL); private wholesale pharmacies, non-government organizations, and Health Facilities (hospitals). A sample size of 103 respondents was determined by the Yamane formula, and purposive sampling was used to select the respondents to complete a self-administered questionnaire specifically developed for this study. The outcome measures were perceived benefits, challenges, and strategies to overcome challenges of collaborative partnerships among health supply chain stakeholders in Rwanda. Availability of health commodities ranked at 98.0%, infrastructure/accessibility of health services (86.4%), and cost-effectiveness (84.5%) were the most mentioned benefits. Most stated challenges included insufficient financial resources from stakeholders (84.5%), shortage of skilled staff (77.7%), and limited dialogue or lack of information sharing (69.9%). Most respondents agreed that collaborative partnerships can be improved by political will (96.1%), supply performance measurement (92.2%), improved financing policies (84.5%), fostering trust and transparency building (78.6%), and a well-structured health supply chain (72.5%). Establishing and strengthening stakeholder collaborations are essential for improved performance. Staff capacity strengthening and mutual information sharing will reduce risks, and improve forecasting, leading to cost-effectiveness and customer satisfaction.",2025-01-14,
Decoding systemic risks across commodities and emerging market stock markets,"Abstract This study explores correlations and risk spillovers, essential concepts for financial risk management, among commodities (crude oil, gold, and a global commodities index) and emerging stock markets. Using the Asymmetric Dynamic Conditional Correlation–Conditional Value-at-Risk (ADCC-CoVaR) model and a bootstrapped Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, we analyze the period from December 30, 2005, to February 28, 2024, examining correlations, downside and upside risk spillovers, and highlighting the effects of major events such as the global financial crisis of 2008, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war. The results show heightened correlations during crises and significant risk spillovers across market pairs, with downside risks often outweighing upside risks. Gold displays minimal risk spillover, highlighting its unique role as a haven asset. We find that spillovers between gold, global commodities, and stocks increased during the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while those involving crude oil remained stable. These findings provide valuable guidance for portfolio managers in navigating volatile markets.",2025-01-14,
Financial and legal regulation of virtual currency circulation,"Virtual currencies have become an important part of the modern financial system, influencing economic processes and financial transactions. They include cryptocurrencies and electronic money used for fast and secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, operate on the basis of decentralized systems and blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and anonymity of payments. At the same time, electronic money is backed by government or financial institutions and is pegged to fiat currencies, which ensures its stability. The main problem that arises when using virtual currencies is the lack of clear legal regulation, which creates a number of risks for states and users. Today, government agencies need to define the legal status of cryptocurrencies and develop appropriate legislation to regulate their circulation, taxation, and the operation of crypto exchanges. This will help to protect consumer rights and prevent financial crimes such as money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing. Virtual currencies open up new opportunities for global markets by lowering transaction costs and reducing the need for financial intermediaries. However, their anonymity and lack of proper regulation pose significant challenges to public financial systems that seek to ensure economic stability and financial transparency. Virtual currencies are creating a new model of commodity-money relations, which simultaneously brings new opportunities for businesses and citizens and challenges for government agencies. They reduce transaction costs, allow for quick payments, and facilitate access to international markets. However, the lack of clear regulations and oversight leads to risks that threaten economic stability and consumer rights. The development of an effective regulatory framework is essential to mitigate these risks and to the development of virtual currencies in the future. This article analyzes the key issues of legal regulation of virtual currencies, as well as the prospects for their development based on current legislation.",2025-01-14,
"Dynamic Connectedness across Equity, Currency, and Commodity Markets in South Asia: A Time- Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive Approach","This study examines the dynamic return spillovers among major South Asian financial markets, including equity indices from India (NIFTY50R), Pakistan (KSER), and Sri Lanka (SLASPIR), as well as key global commodities such as Brent crude oil (BrentR) and gold (GoldR), and the relevant exchange rates (USDINR, USDPKR, and USDLKR). Using the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive (TVP- VAR) connectedness approach, the analysis covers the period from March 2, 2005, to February 29, 2024, providing insights into how financial shocks propagate across these interconnected markets over nearly two decades. The findings reveal that the Indian equity market (NIFTY50R) and the Indian Rupee exchange rate (USDINR) serve as significant transmitters of shocks within the South Asian region, influencing other regional markets. Conversely, the Sri Lankan (SLASPIR) and Pakistani (KSER) equity indices are identified as net receivers of shocks, indicating their vulnerability to external financial disturbances. The study also highlights the pivotal role of Brent crude oil prices (BrentR) in driving spillovers, particularly affecting the Indian financial markets. The study's findings have significant implications for understanding the complexities of market interconnectedness in South Asia, particularly in the context of global economic integration.",2025-01-13,
COMPARISON OF SARIMA AND SARIMAX METHODS FOR FORECASTING HARVESTED DRY GRAIN PRICES IN INDONESIA,"Harvested dry grain (HDG) is a vital commodity for rice availability and plays a strategic role in Indonesia’s agricultural economy. Farmers typically sell HDG to rice millers post-harvest, yet disparities between farm-level selling prices and consumer-level purchase prices. This price gap can lead to financial losses for farmers, highlighting the need for accurate forecasting can lead to potential losses for farmers. SARIMA models are effective in capturing seasonality and trends but often fail to incorporate external factors influencing the dependent variable, resulting in less accurate forecasts when such factors have significant impacts. SARIMAX models, however, can include exogenous variables like the government purchase price (GPP), which supports farmer income by establishing a price floor for HDG and directly influencing farm-level price dynamics. This study aims to compare the SARIMA and SARIMAX models in forecasting HDG prices at the farm level in Indonesia, using GPP as an exogenous variable. The dataset, obtained from Statistics Indonesia, covers January 2008 to March 2024, and the forecasting accuracy is measured using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The findings indicate that the best model is the SARIMAX model (1,1,1)(0,1,2)12, achieving a MAPE of 10.919%. The forecasted results show that HDG prices in 2024 are expected to remain stable, with only a gradual increase throughout the year.",2025-01-13,
"Does the crisis period affect the properties of various financial assets: evidence from G7, BRIC, GCC countries","This paper investigates the role of various financial assets as diversifiers, hedges, and safe havens using the dynamic conditional correlation-GARCH and quantile regression models, for the period from August, 10 2015 to June, 5 2024 for the case of G7, BRIC, and GCC countries. Results show that gold's robust safe-haven status, alongside commodities like oil, gas, and wheat, which exhibit varying degrees of resilience in turbulent market conditions. Our findings identify the G7 and BRIC indices as strong safe havens, contrasting with the clean energy index, which shows limited safe-haven properties during crises. This research provides critical insights into asset behavior under extreme market volatility, offering practical implications for investment strategies and risk management by highlight the strategic decisions for asset allocation during uncertain financial periods.",2025-01-12,

Empowering Global Supply Chains Through Blockchain-Based Platforms: New Evidence from the Coffee Industry,"Global supply chains, especially in commodity trading, are plagued by fragmentation, lack of transparency, and trust deficits among participants. These issues lead to inefficiencies, increased costs, and an over-reliance on intermediaries. The present Communication describes a blockchain-based platform that leverages Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to address these challenges in supply chain management. Developed in collaboration with coffee industry stakeholders, our approach proposes a platform with an integrated marketplace for seller discovery, enables precise order definition with detailed terms and conditions, and actively guides both buyers and sellers throughout the shipping process, managing financial guarantees and ensuring a secure transaction flow. The platform is compatible with both traditional banking infrastructure and modern crypto-based systems, enabling seamless financial transactions. In cases where disputes arise, we empower users to easily collect all communications and documents to present to legal authorities, expediting the resolution process. The platform is implemented using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for secure, on-chain storage and application hosting, and is integrated with the Ethereum blockchain to leverage its extensive decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, significant liquidity, and robust stablecoin infrastructure, thereby facilitating secure financial transactions. Moreover, we introduce an SSI-based authentication and authorization framework that spans across the entire platform, including both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), enabling unified role-based access control through verifiable credentials. A value-added of the present Communication, the framework is demonstrated by means of a detailed case study in the coffee industry, highlighting the technical challenges addressed during implementation. While quantitative efficiency metrics will be established through upcoming real-world testing with industry partners, the platform’s design aims to streamline operations by reducing intermediary dependencies and automating key processes. Finally, the Communication provides insights into its adaptability to other industries facing comparable supply chain challenges, presenting an approach focused on enhancing trust and reducing reliance on intermediaries.",2025-01-10,
Using Futures Prices and Analysts’ Forecasts to Estimate Agricultural Commodity Risk Premiums,"This paper presents a novel 5-factor model for agricultural commodity risk premiums, an approach not explored in previous research. The model is applied to the specific cases of corn, soybeans, and wheat. Calibration is achieved using a Kalman filter and maximum likelihood, with data from futures markets and analysts’ forecasts. Risk premiums are computed by comparing expected and futures prices. The model considers that risk premiums are not solely determined by contract maturity but also by the marketing crop years. These crop years, in turn, are influenced by the respective harvest periods, a crucial factor in the agricultural commodity market. Results show that risk premiums vary across commodities, with some exhibiting positive and others negative values. While maturity affects risk premiums’ size, sign, and shape, the crop year plays a critical role, especially in the case of wheat. As speculators in the financial markets demand a positive risk premium, its sign provides insights into whether they are buyers or sellers of futures for each crop year, maturity, and commodity. This research offers valuable insights into grain price behavior, highlighting their similarities and differences. These findings have significant practical implications for market participants seeking to refine their trading and risk management strategies and for future research on the industry structure for each crop. Moreover, this enhanced understanding of risk premiums can be directly applied in the finance and agricultural industries, improving decision-making processes.",2025-01-10,
"The future of hybrid cloud: Trends, technologies, and predictions","The future of hybrid cloud is poised for significant transformation, driven by emerging trends and technologies that enable greater agility, scalability, and innovation. This abstract explores key developments shaping the future, such as the increasing adoption of edge computing, AI-powered automation, and the rise of multi-cloud environments. It also highlights advancements in security, interoperability, and data management that will address the complexities of hybrid cloud architectures. Predictions for the future include more seamless integration between public and private clouds, enhanced cost optimization strategies, and a shift toward more sustainable, efficient cloud solutions. These trends promise to redefine the hybrid cloud landscape. Keywords Hybrid Cloud, Future of Hybrid Cloud, Cloud Trends, Cloud Technologies, Multi-Cloud, Edge Computing, AI Automation, Cloud Security, Cloud Interoperability, Data Management, Cloud Integration, Cost Optimization, Sustainable Cloud Solutions, Cloud Predictions, Cloud Scalability, Cloud Innovation, Hybrid Cloud Architecture. 11.1. Introduction Hybrid cloud computing involves employing two public clouds or private and public clouds situated separately. Hybrid cloud combines the strengths of both private and public clouds. Moreover, the combination of hybrid cloud with traditional model resulting in distributed cloud will mean an emergence of a new concept that may also demonstrate its position in future Internet services. In the past, systems of service-oriented architecture (SOA) adopted the technology of Web service to realize the connection between the systems overall through the Web service. Essentially, the hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment comprising public and private cloud services, which work together because of an interoperability mechanism. Nevertheless, it is still difficult for many works that require cloud-distributed services to measure cloud resources and evaluate which cloud can provide better services (Nampalli et al., 2024). For that reason, there is a need to excel in developing a new theoretical model that utilizes the same parameters for quantifying and predicting services between clouds in a hybrid cloud. There is also the need for a model that can hide complex technology namely middleware to enlarge the range of cloud users. Several trends behind stage various types of cloud computing along with the prospects of hybrid cloud in the next couple of years are addressed. It is worth stating that the hybrid cloud paradigm with SOA will be a breakthrough for establishing future cloud Internet services. Hybrid cloud computing combines the strengths of both private and public clouds, offering a flexible and scalable infrastructure that leverages the advantages of each. By integrating hybrid cloud with traditional models, resulting in a distributed cloud, a new concept is emerging that could shape the future of Internet services. Historically, systems built on service-oriented architecture (SOA) used web services to connect various systems, allowing for seamless communication across diverse platforms. Similarly, hybrid cloud environments bring together public and private clouds through interoperability mechanisms, enabling seamless interaction between them. However, a key challenge remains in measuring cloud resources and determining which cloud can provide the best services for specific workloads. To address this, there is a need for the development of a new theoretical model that can quantify and predict services across hybrid clouds using consistent parameters. This model should simplify complex technologies, such as middleware, to make cloud services more accessible to a broader range of users. As cloud computing continues to evolve, the hybrid cloud paradigm, when combined with SOA, is poised to be a transformative force in the establishment of future cloud-based Internet services. 11.2. Understanding Hybrid Cloud Computing Cloud computing refers to the delivery of scalable, network-based services whose logical architecture is based on the proliferation of devices and the creation of distributed systems. As cloud computing is being used in more and varied fields, both cloud computing providers and clients are interested in accomplishing the best results. So, the main goal of Improved Cloud Computing Architecture is to find and optimize a cost-effective architecture in cloud computing according to its service requirements. The hybrid cloud model, which is more important and new among the examined cloud systems, has many differences compared to the other models (Danda, et al., 2024). The enterprises, which have workload characteristics, are silent for starting to use cloud systems. It is seen that companies prefer the syntheses that are selected for their workload characteristics as a return to using both private or public clouds. Another important reason for the use of hybrid clouds is the need for better control. It should not be forgotten that the hybrid cloud model will be more reinforced by the improvement of regulatory proposals. The aim of the paper is to describe the improved cloud computing architecture that can show how virtual resources can automatically adapt to available resources, new service requests and their performance degradation or improvement. Fig 11.1: The Future of Cloud Computing and Predictions Equation 1: Hybrid Cloud Sustainability Metrics 11.2.1. Definition and Concept Hybrid clouds have grown in popularity and their use will become even more widespread in the near future. A hybrid cloud architecture contrasts with full public cloud services in that it keeps a crossbreed of private cloud delivered services and public cloud provider services. That will be becoming a general trend among SMEs that cannot afford a high investment in the cloud infrastructure. The Post-Snowden internet targets privacy. Companies start to move to physical forms of cyber security after revelations on wide scale snooping by intelligence services were revealed (Shakir, 2024). In Germany, for example, data sovereignty is one of the arguments that drives electronic data storage sales in order to keep data locally. In turn towards privacy, hybrid clouds will offer a solution for customers who want to take their services away from cloud service providers. US-based service providers will find it hard to acquire new non-US customers as concerns on privacy remain. 11.2.2. Benefits and Challenges The need to move around bits and control things was an overwhelming reason individuals and businesses pushed Oracle to rethink their design. One researcher's experiment found that the average distance a device traveled to reach a new destination was akin to a vehicle driving around the earth at the equator for 12 years. Public and profitable clouds attempt to solve this problem by providing a finite number of destinations for all computational resources. Public cloud infrastructure providers have acquired, built, and distributed edge caching/data transfer appliances near their points of peerage in order to increase and bridge the networking performance and scripting language barriers. The hybrid cloud model democratizes this concept by placing essentially ""cloud-enabled"" edge appliances in a wider distribution outside of the public cloud networks themselves (Vankayalapati et al., 2021). This allows for the formation of a global network of relatively independently managed and operated ""Oracle Machines"" that can solve the networking performance issues on a global scale. In this scenario, bits can easily move between clouds, clients can configure virtually any destination for their computational resources, and significant power will be shifted from service providers back to cloud clients and their developers. Fig: Cloud Computing Trends to stay beyond 2022 11.3. Current Trends in Hybrid Cloud Adoption There has been a significant increase in hybrid cloud adoption in the past few years. With enterprises rapidly expanding their cloud-based applications and services, there is growing interest and a need for comprehensive solutions to easily model and automate these applications, and to manage and orchestrate them across their data center, private, and public clouds. Hybrid and multi-clouds are increasingly seen in the industry as a way to replace the traditional backup and disaster recovery systems. Innovations in enterprise application development are now possible through platforms such as Cloudify. Cloudify gives the consumer the flexibility to write his own G-CPD (Generic-Cloudify Provider Definition) and plugin. G-CPD can be defined for any cloud provider. It should describe how attributes chosen by the consumer must be transformed in a request for the specific cloud provider. The generation of the request must also take care of transforming regions, availability zones, data centers and possibly also zones of the provider. Cloudify can be used also as a development environment where blueprints can be developed and tested in the local testbed and then moved in the cloud. There is also a command that automatically creates a zip artifact from a blueprint file. The portability is guaranteed. By 2018, 451 Research found that companies around the world were spending 28% of their external budget on cloud services. By 2019, market estimates are that the worldwide public cloud services supplies will reach up to $206 Billion, up from $111 Billion in 2016, and the infrastructure spending will reach $50 Billion. Cloud computing has now become the new normal rather than emerging, and soon, with its growing importance and demand, it is going to be a commodity which everyone will have to move to (Kothapalli et al., 2021). Hence, the demand for easy resource management and control will also grow and the hybrid cloud will play a vital role in this. Oracle has recently integrated a new ""bring your own license"" strategy that will allow the customers to shift the existing licenses and have them accepted on the Oracle public cloud. On another side, IBM showed a significant improvement on the cloud profit, and Microsoft Azure is previewing the arrival of the Microsoft Azure Stack. 11.4. Key Technologies Shaping the Future of Hybrid Cloud Cloud computing service models of IaaS and PaaS, hybrid cloud computing, and the current situation of container technology are surveyed to make future predictions about hybrid cloud and container technology. Hybrid cloud may continue to grow due to dominance of large enterprises, which have legacy systems due to advantages of scale of hybrid cloud and are necessary for the first step in cloud-native. Cloud will become a private cloud or hybrid cloud, and high-performance computing, which is limited by public cloud, will be led by private cloud. Service models of cloud computing are based on SAAS, but in the future, IaaS currently in the leading position will be overtaken by PaaS. PaaS simplifies development of applications by providing a development environment and middleware, and goods management will center around web services. Fig 11.2: The Future of Cloud Computing In A Changing Digital Landscape This survey reports about cloud computing, which is a recent technology trend in IT business. It has rapidly spread in the industry (Kothapalli et al., 2022). This is because of cost reduction and efficiency improvement in IT resources. Cloud computing service has several distinct service types or models. Some fundamental service models will be discussed. Equation 2: Cloud-Specific Technologies Impact on Hybrid Cloud 11.4.1. Containers and Microservices Containers and microservices are quickly becoming the foundation for the new cloud-native application platform. Both allow developers to architect, build, deploy, and manage applications in a more consistent and simplified way regardless of the target environment. Docker containers and Kubernetes are becoming the de facto standard for building, deploying, and managing (containerized) workloads on-premises and, in public clouds, creating a clear path for the hybrid cloud approach. Different studies highlight the trend towards Docker containers and Kubernetes. The most notable are the Docker Ecosystem and the CNCF landscape covering Kubernetes, CNIs, CD tools, etc. 11.4.2. Software-Defined Networking The public and hybrid clouds are expected to continue their growth trend, fuelled by the expansion of data centers and cloud services provided beyond the borders of industries. From the public cloud services end, numerous actors will introduce endeavors integrating computing, storage, communication, or even specialty services such as GIS as automated services, accelerating the pace of service proliferation and technological innovation. Whatever platform is chosen, the ability for systems and services to be portable seems an almost ubiquitous requirement for the 3rd platform. Hybrid and multi-clouds are developing to support this, with a slew of different but interoperable technologies (Subhash et al., 2022). For network providers in data centers—how the new idea of software defined network (SDN) will impact equipment choices and the design and provisioning of the network is assessed. Currently, the network plays an important role in many applications that are deployed in clouds. This is particularly true for latency-sensitive or high-throughput applications. Often, when we consider cloud applications, the focus tends to be on computing and data storage resources, with the underlying assumption that the network will be able to deal appropriately with the requirement. an assumption that will not always be justified. This leads to the conclusion that SDN deployments will tend to be most useful in applications where the network matters most; in particular, applications that are sensitive to network delay or throughput. Fig: Hybrid Cloud and Multi-Cloud the Future of Enterprise 11.5. Predictions for the Future of Hybrid Cloud Over the past few years, hybrid cloud has evolved and become a significant option for businesses. Knowing and understanding the challenges of hybrid cloud computing will allow for their follow-up in terms of research endeavors. So far, the existing challenges and trends in hybrid cloud computing are explored and a conceptual model is also proposed to illustrate the many aspects and further understanding of this recent research development. Hybrid cloud is the natural choice of the many cloud users as it offers the benefits of both public and private clouds (Sondinti et al., 2023). This smart model is a composition of two or more cloud deployment types. It has similar characteristics of public and private clouds. A small business can put the gem of data on the private cloud. While other data and applications could be distributed to the other cloud providers. pointed out that trade is going faster than ever because of competition. Though, companies have migration options such as cloud. Fig Trends Shaping the Future of Cloud Computing Hybrid Cloud 11.5.1. Security and Compliance Enhancements Public, private and hybrid Cloud computing for deploying, managing, and improving applications is a key trend for delivering products, services and computing infrastructures. Due to the flexibility of Cloud computing, businesses switch traditional IT infrastructure to Cloud systems. At the same time, Cloud vendors extend their offers with more and more hybrid models of IT infrastructure, which contains physical, virtual, and Cloud components. Nevertheless, the hybrid solutions bring new challenges such as Security, Automation, and SLA Assurance. 11.5.2. Edge Computing Integration More devices are being connected to the cloud and to other devices than ever before. As a result, there is a growing need for low latency for many devices and users. Typically most devices are connected to the internet through a local network router which, in turn, connects back to the cloud. In this setup, there are many intermediate network switches as well as lengthy connections to a remote site which can all introduce delay, collectively known as latency. To improve how applications are served at low latency ""edge computing"" is proposed where the computing capacities are moved to the edge of the network, closer to where data is produced and consumed (Vankayalapati et al., 2023). It is a new notion where the Cloud provides resources to the components associated with the devices. However, hosting servers and services in every network node would lead to unsustainable costs. 11.6. Conclusion The trend and technology suggest that the hybrid cloud is the future of cloud computing and would enhance the way globally things are done. IT experts and businessmen are starting to make a shift for the hybrid cloud due to its unique characteristic, it provides the best of the two worlds, since it combines security and control from the private cloud, and flexibility and cost savings of the public cloud. The form of hybrid cloud that would have the most potential for the future is the one that has the ability to offer workload portability, resource usage tracking, compliance monitoring, workload mobility, and a federated self-service interface across different clouds. Because of this, several technologies to improve the use case of hybrid cloud have been developed by a cloud vendor over the past few years, one of which is a hybrid cloud service broker. A cloud service broker is defined as a cloud technology delivery intermediary that facilitates cloud adoption and consumption by acting as a common point of control, integration, and security for computing services delivered across multiple cloud service offerings. While an intermediary is defined as a third-party service provider that offers intermediation or aggregation services to create a value-added user experience for one or more cloud forms. 11.6.1. Future Trends The cloud computing model shifted from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to a platform-based approach: Platform as a Service (PaaS). Like IaaS, PaaS offers essential infrastructure for hosting applications. At the same time, it allows building and managing applications with a much higher level of abstraction. In contrast to this and in contrast to pure software products, PaaS is not just code that can be bought and deployed. PaaS as a product, is more of an API, an API plus DOC which tells you how you can interact with a stack in order to get allocations of execution, storage, networking, etc. Such an abstraction provides the much-needed usability potential of PaaS (Maguluri et al., 2022). By outlining interface properties, Cloudify aims to be more of a PaaS. Though a tool, the fact that metadata is defined as a global, unchangeable state common to all nodes, limits the scope for how deployment is engineered. With respect to iClouds, an evaluation finds that frequently requested functionalities are missing from the iClouds platform. In situations that do not allow the use of dependencies, placement of scripts, executable instructions and support for checks on target machines require tools with complex scripting capabilities. Cloudify's IaaS interaction model allows deployment on any resource, while on iClouds implementation is fixed to one or more statically selected targets through node groups and zone affinity.

Architectural foundations of hybrid cloud solutions,"Hybrid cloud solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure, offering a strategic blend of public and private cloud environments to meet diverse business needs. The architectural foundations of hybrid cloud systems are built on principles of interoperability, scalability, security, and flexibility, enabling seamless integration and management of workloads across heterogeneous platforms. This abstract examines the core components of hybrid cloud architecture, including network connectivity, data integration, workload orchestration, and governance frameworks. It highlights the role of emerging technologies such as containerization, microservices, and AI-driven automation in enhancing hybrid cloud functionality. Additionally, it explores the challenges of designing hybrid cloud systems, such as ensuring compatibility and maintaining consistent performance, while providing best practices for successful deployment. By understanding these architectural principles, organizations can unlock the full potential of hybrid cloud solutions to drive innovation, reduce costs, and achieve operational excellence.

Introduction Hybrid cloud solutions are now an important tool in the modern computing toolbox. An increasing number of organizations want to combine resources and workloads from both on-premises and cloud environments, but find it difficult to understand how best to architect, configure and operate a hybrid environment. This is to be expected. The reason that on-premises and cloud resources are convergent is that it has been the intention of both the cloud vendors and the on-premises vendors to converge them. Years in the making, the cloud-on-premises convergence represents a convergence of business interests; the cloud vendors are striving to grow the cloud revenue while the on-premises vendors are striving to protect it (Syed, 2023). This convergence lies at the very heart of what defines a hybrid cloud solution – how the on-premises and cloud resources work together. For an effective and long-term solution to this, it is necessary to first understand the fundamental architectural components of how a cloud/on-premises environment works. There is no one 'hybrid cloud,' but there are core aspects of hybrid cloud architecture that are consistent across multiple of the wide variety of contexts in which hybrid clouds may be deployed. An effective architectural foundation that defines and explains these core aspects is key to unlocking the potential of a successful long term hybrid cloud solution. Background on cloud technology and its evolution from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to more complex offerings will be provided. The usage of cloud computing is shown to have evolved, or matured, with the demands of organizations into more value adding models such as Platform- and Software-as-a-Service. With this genesis, it comes as little surprise that businesses now require more nuanced and mature cloud solutions, such as hybrid clouds, that best meet their diverse organizational needs. This analysis also notes that hybrid clouds are now the most broadly adopted execution model of cloud resources. This marks a maturation of cloud usage that has seen growing realization by organizations that the benefits of cloud compute may need to be balanced with a certain degree of control; a space in the middle ground that hybrid clouds aptly fill. The architectural aspects of hybrid clouds will be discussed with a particular focus on how the core components of on-premises, cloud, and data center facility resources are combined into the larger architecture (Nampalli, 2023). QME will be considered at a high level across all of these components, and a practical example is detailed in order to fully ground the discussion. Fig 2.1: Hybrid Cloud Architecture Diagram 2.1.1. Background and Significance Within the last decade, the contemporary ways of offering resources and services on the cloud have undergone monumental changes. These changes have been aimed at accommodating applications that are now designed to optimally leverage the cloud infrastructure by making use of the most suitable, sometimes heterogeneous resources available, all in a way that was unlikely or impossible just a short while ago. These resources often seem to come from different cloud providers and are progressively oriented towards that vision. The combined use of multiple resources from different national clouds has become mainstream in some sectors, like high-performance computing (Danda, 2023). This scenario represents the next step in the evolution of distributed cloud, transforming the current notion of cloud federation with just a transversal view, into new computing architectures more complex, where a combination of resources is offered and consumed in different ways. 2.2. Understanding Hybrid Cloud Solutions Recent advances in cloud services and the rapid growth of cloud service offerings have led to increased interest in moving parts of existing on-premise IT to the cloud. While some applications and workloads are migrated from on-premise to the cloud, many organizations also need to maintain part of their business-critical computing on their own infrastructure. When considering the enormous investments made in setting up the on-premise infrastructure, no organization is going to simply throw it away and move everything to the cloud. Hybrid cloud solutions address this by connecting on-premise infrastructure with a public cloud. There are a large number of public cloud offerings which provide a wide range of services, enabling organizations to cherry-pick IT components for various requirements while only paying for what is used. In this case, public cloud services complement the on-premise infrastructure like a puzzle piece: the best of both worlds. Generally, cloud solutions can be categorized into three types, private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud. Migrating all workloads to public cloud services describes the situation of a public cloud solution. In the context of the cloud computing model, which defines essential characteristics for infrastructure, platform, and services, the public cloud model offers self-service computing resources and services on demand to the public. On the other hand, private cloud services are rendered by IT resources that are dedicated to the using organization or provisioned by on-premise hardware. This is referred to as a private cloud. The lines for what is a private cloud and what is not are controversial and difficult to draw. However, hybrid cloud services can be regarded as a subtype of cloud services that derive from a complex interconnection of a public cloud and an on-premise infrastructure (Syed, 2023). The on-premise infrastructure can be operated as a private cloud and should follow some of the cloud computing model's essential characteristics. Public cloud service providers offer several mechanisms and technologies to facilitate integration and orchestration with on-premise infrastructure. In the simplest case, files or data can be replicated between on-premise and public cloud infrastructure. An API is required for more intelligent features like workload portability or the usage of on-premise security services in public cloud workloads. hypers, like workload portability, and the possible integration of cloud infrastructures through interoperability. Moreover, besides the integration of cloud infrastructures, advantages can be taken from a combination of public and private IT resources, like dynamic resource allocation or the usage of on-premise backup systems for critical workloads. Equation 1: Scalability (Elasticity) Equation 2.2.1. Definition and Characteristics In 2009, a few research groups pointed out that a hybrid cloud refers to a combination of public and private cloud infrastructure. However, the border between public and private clouds is not explicitly demarcated, which leads to confusion about the definition of hybrid clouds on the part of prospective customers and cloud service providers. To clarify the definition of hybrid clouds, we will examine the relationship between public and private clouds from an economic viewpoint and propose a precise definition of hybrid clouds (Nampalli, 2022). Then the unique standpoint of hybrid clouds in the cloud computing ecosystem will be discussed. Along this line of thought, the article will also consider several existing cloud models and clarify what distinguishes a hybrid model from pure public or private ones. Public cloud services are exploited under the same conditions by multiple customers, who pay pay-per-use fees when utilizing services. Private cloud services are, however, intended for the exclusive use of a single organization, which should invest a large amount of resources for the construction of the private cloud infrastructure: e.g., hiring professionals having knowledge on constructing and administering cloud infrastructures, selecting and purchasing appropriate hardware, and establishing partnerships with multiple cloud software and hardware vendors. In contrast to the infrastructure construction, public cloud services can be utilized more easily and without significant initial setup fees. It is one of the construction costs necessary to build an IT platform, and also heavy capital is invested in calculating the anticipated amount of usage. The advantage of public clouds is that it is 'easy to use' as long as a pay-per-use fee is paid when using the service. From an economic point of view, while the pricing for public clouds is similar to the electricity bill, private clouds are different from commodity services. Therefore, public clouds can be used similarly to a pay-per-use baseband service in contrast to private clouds which require a large capital cost to 'build its own network' and pay the monthly rental charges regardless of use. With these assumptions, research groups seemed to have defined that hybrid is a mixture of public clouds. However, it is argued that under the same definition electricity can be claimed to be utilized in a hybrid cloud like way, since a part of the electricity bill is settled by private electricity generators owned and maintained by the customer, while another part is from the public electricity company. 2.2.2. Benefits and Challenges By now, public cloud services have matured sufficiently to be considered a viable delivery method for many business applications, but it is well known that some data and services remain more appropriate for private infrastructure or traditional hosting. Since there are benefits to both public and private models, a hybrid solution that combines elements of both is seen to be a balance, providing an efficient infrastructure for services that can be effectively moved to a shared resource, while retaining flexibility for offerings that require a different niche. However, while there are many potential benefits, it is important to review the associated challenges, as well as the trade-offs made when moving to a hybrid model. One major advantage of cloud computing is the ability to scale computing resources up or down easily and without incurring substantial capital costs. Using hybrid cloud services, organizations can scale applications selectively, offloading seasonal workloads, web front-ends, or development environments to the pay-as-you-go public cloud space and reducing on-premises resources required for steady state peaks. For example, nightly data processing tasks for a database server can run on a virtual server hosted by a public IaaS provider and automatically scale to three instances if the workload exceeds a certain limit. Unused instances are de-provisioned automatically outside work hours (Tulasi et al., 2022). There is potential to use cloud and on-prem services to strategically make better trade-offs: expensive resources are kept on-prem, while others can be offloaded, for example. Organizations need to carefully evaluate which services to outsource and which to keep internally and invest in monitoring resources to enable better decision making about workload placement. This means that monitoring data needs to be gathered at multiple levels of the infrastructure from databases, OS, networking devices and application servers, and that data is used effectively to adjust workload placement decision making systems. Fig: Hybrid Cloud Considerations Are Rising 2.3. Architectural Principles Pivotal investment decisions are the design and construction of the basic architectural model for a suitable HTTPS in accordance with the individual business requirements of the company. The robust and sustainable implementation requires the embodiment of different architectural principles to support the key objectives of hybrid, flexible, scalable, secure, and compliant cloud systems. Built in typical manner by a combination of PaaS, SaaS, and private infrastructure, hybrid cloud architectures could become complex and tidily workplaces (Venkata et al., 2022). However, with the basic design approach, the main building blocks needed by the organization can be ordered to deliver the most reliable and usable solution. Architectural principles provide organizations with a clearer understanding of what they are doing, or need to be able to do, when implementing a hybrid cloud system based on broader business objectives. Part of the enormous success of cloud services would contribute to the accuracy of the cost structure, with the organization billed as a pay-per-use basis. Hence an inevitable advantage of cloud solutions is the scale, enabling firms to be ready to cope with fluctuating requirements in an increasingly unpredictable demand pattern. Taking advantage of this utility feature is necessary for a flexible architecture in boto hybrid and coexisting cloud systems that can effectively adjust resources in response to various demand conditions. Businesses have always used applications to run. However, by taking the form of a standardized and available service, cloud apps represent an evolution in the way organizations consume software. Obviously, some current and future capabilities can be included in the context of the cloud model. It is imperative for AMP solutions to be procured and sold that the architectural environment is able to support the different needs of applications, products, and business requirements possible and accurately anticipated. At its heart are computational products that do work with data. At the same time, the data consists of the most sensitive emails and files, patient and biological records as well as financial information just to name a few examples. Fig 2.2: Principles for Cloud Architecture Design 2.3.1. Scalability and Flexibility In the age of the digital transformation, IT must provide scalable solutions on-premises and in the cloud to address dynamically changing workloads. New and business critical workloads have to be established fast and with the most flexibility as possible. Advanced businesses need to scale their services in a dynamic and elastic way. Scalability meets the need for businesses to allocate resources dynamically during runtime according to real-time requirements (Pandugula et al., 2024). A pay-per-use, scale-out model allows automating the scaling process for state-of-the art technologies. With the growing criticality of workloads running on these businesses, it is essential for IT departments to ensure responsible service up-time. Nevertheless, corresponding machinery, and software technologies including the services using them, give businesses immense power to quickly and flexibly change. They benefit from (very) short innovation cycles to secure or extend market shares. Successfully implemented services convert end-users to be technology providers or suppliers which creates a constant stream of new visionaries innovating their domain of activity Integrating new technologies on-the-fly is crucial, but the corresponding workload has to be supported upstream and downstream. 2.3.2. Security and Compliance Security and compliance are of utmost importance for organizational acceptance of hybrid cloud solutions. Security is a growing concern among organizations looking to move critical workloads to hybrid cloud environments, while compliance with industry regulations is often a mandatory or simply best practice way to do business. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy to protecting sensitive data across a distributed architecture as hybrid cloud (Kalisetty et al., 2023). It requires a robust, multi-faceted security framework that may often need to be tailored to better address unique business requirements. Even with the most sophisticated security measures in place, organizations still need to continuously monitor and adjust what goes on in the environment, as well as have a clear, well-practised plan for incident response. In light of increasing interconnections and dependencies across business sectors and geographies, compliance with industry regulations is now an indispensable aspect of doing business. This often mandates comprehensive access controls, through which only authorized personnel using authorized means can access sensitive information. 2.4. Case Studies As illustrated by analysts at the Gartner Group, a hybrid cloud computing environment presents a sophisticated solution involving a significant number of components, products, and variables. To establish such an environment, a variety of complex factors are considered and forms the basis of this dissertation. The focus of this chapter is to shift towards a more practical, high-level approach to the subject by focusing on diverse case studies that showcase successful implementations of hybrid cloud solutions within different industries. This approach highlights best practices and strategies from which organizations can learn for ensuring the successful deployment of hybrid clouds. 1.1 Atos Represents a High-Integrity Hybrid Container Platform The selection of these case studies was made primarily on the basis of ease of extendibility to the foundational aspects of hybrid clouds. However, for the reader, the broad range of areas that are covered also offers hands-on insight into areas such as security, connectivity, cost, resource management, load balancing, privacy, and performance, among others. More technically inclined readers will also find insight into the tangible technologies that underlie successful hybrid cloud infrastructure implementations. 1.2 Case Study I: Fine-Tuning Existing Virtualized HPC Applications Computational Engineering International (CEI) specializes in the production and provision of EnSight, a visualization platform specifically designed for engineers. Initially founded by engineers to produce products for engineers, their expertise has been the key to the company's success beginning in the late 1980s. For over a quarter of a century, CEI has successfully serviced fifty of the Fortune 100 companies with a customer base consisting of users from the automotive, aerospace, defense, electronics, and biomedical industries, among others. Equation 2: Cost Optimization Equation 2.4.1. Successful Implementations Hybrid cloud solutions offer organizations a number of ways to leverage off-premises services to complement their on-premises assets. A number of successful implementations are discussed below, and each describes results and strategies used. Each of the examples below represents a different approach to hybrid cloud solutions and forms a pattern through the challenges of moving from the two to the four steps from on-prem to cloud. Each of these examples also shows how organizations have overcome the challenges of making on-premises assets compatible with cloud services, and how to ensure compatibility between on-prem assets and the cloud is set out as a lesson to be learnt (Sondinti et al., 2023). Each of these examples also illustrates how diverse stakeholders within an organization have been engaged to drive successful deployment, and the importance of engaging stakeholders is described as an important learning. In reflecting on these, any organization involved in the transition to a hybrid cloud solution will hopefully be better placed to develop implementation strategies using methods that have already been tested and confirmed. Recent growth in the use of cloud services particularly from hyperscale cloud providers (HCP) has created both challenges and opportunities for other enterprises (non-HCP). Opportunities include easier access to more services enabling greater agility and the ability to scale up quickly, best in class provision, and payment models that can align cost with usage. However, long-established infrastructure investment risks becoming inflexible when compared with the dynamic resources offered by the cloud. Also, HCPM becomes increasingly difficult as non-HCP implement InterCloud solutions. Successful leveraging of the cloud by non-HCPs requires strategies to align cloud services both with current cloud technologies held in the enterprise and investment in on-prem tools. By adopting a structured approach, organizations determine the availability of cloud services and local technology as well as the on-prem tooling investment needed to achieve that alignment. Fig: Multi Cloud Architecture – Everything You Need to Know 2.5. Future Trends and Innovations There are several trends emerging that are projected to be significant advancements in the field and landscape of hybrid cloud solutions. There is potential to make organizations aware of such to prepare and help navigate through the rapidly changing environment. Some of the next-generation technologies and innovative efforts are projected here, ranging from AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) of loosely-coupled systems of clouds to more intelligent methods in identifying services and allocations. The defining example of this is presented as ScrAIPE (Scalable Resource Allocation for Integrated Public-Results Experiments). Another trend is the broad movement to cloud-native applications, in either containerized or microservices architectures, is pushing such innovative designs in scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. This art was presented with additional observations on Kubernetes, serverless computing, and the emergent designs of NX. It is projected to also be a general trend that one shall see enhanced capabilities and use-cases in cloud platforms in efficient communication, large storage, I/O, computation, and also systems for ML/AI tasks. From a background and motivated by an upcoming experiment in high-energy physics which produces a widely distributed set of datasets, a fundamental understanding is sought in the capability and performance of multi-clouds and high throughput services/allocations across such distributed systems comprising more loosely-coupled providers. This can be helpful to experimental facilities, inadvertent data across the globe, is disbursed, and may be related through utilizing hybrids and over multi-cloud operators. Edge computing is an emerging complementary technology to the cloud service that is projected to attain substantial popularity and importance. This analysis and prospects encompass a characterization of the hybrid network and present observations as to the potentiating research and development challenges and also opportunities. The initial aspect is a character of the hybrid network of HPC, HTC, and XDC; how they are interpreted in various ways across disparate scopes, and how each relies on robustness and the dependability of the others. Following this is speculation on the response of such a network as a broad as it pertains to the contemporary regulatory environment and the future contexts for which utilities and network infra will need to adapt. 2.6. Conclusion The feasibility of current hybrid cloud architectural components is analyzed. There is a discussion about cloud computing principles, including on-demand self-service, ubiquitous network access, location independence, resource pooling, brief elasticity, and our service puppet-master rhythm visualization of the first website and deploy their own hybrid cloud service. Here, for solutions to the deployment of moduli against hybrid clouds, the architectures proposed to develop a task flow analysis and support this process using cloudML. Fig 2.3: Cloud Computing Trends It is essential to understand the technical principles of hybrid clouds to master their design and implementation. These principles not only comprehend how basic cloud concepts, like multi-tenancy or elasticity, take a role in hybrid environments, but also comprise the models unified to operate distinct cloud platforms. In this chapter, a general view is given on the main ideas arising in discussions about hybrid clouds and then focuses on the architectural aspects. Some cases in which these discussions materialize as reference models and components are also given, for example, in a private/public case-study related to the Illinois Nimbus and Amazon EC2 platforms. With most of the architectural components being exemplified in the rest of the text, only two major topics are analyzed here: moduli, a tool for creating and deploying services/components in the cloud, and the infrastructure that should support it. 2.6.1. Future Trends In a rapidly evolving business landscape, IT infrastructure must be flexible, scalable, and dynamic to support digital transformation, innovation, and growth. Organizations seek cloud solutions that are aligned with ever-changing business needs and encompass architectural strategies to support hybrid technology. Future trends in hybrid cloud solutions are forecasted to gauge the expected advancements and innovations that are likely to occur in the technology sector. This analysis is grounded in an inquiry that was conducted with numerous expert stakeholders. Cloud services will become an important part of daily life, both in the public sector and in education as well as in the private sector. Cloud services refer to resources, tools, and services that can be accessed anywhere – work, school, home or on the road . These resources and tools enable users to save data and information. The data center resources (storage, processing, database, etc.) are based on virtualization technology and software solutions. The data centers are organized in IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service. The data center storage resources are accessible in the form of a virtual disk via the network. With the appearance of the cloud, this model has evolved into a more sophisticated service model – the user has at their disposal more complex virtual resources (RAM memory, CPU, disk space), installed with the operating system and various software tools and IP addresses on the Internet for using the virtual server. Moreover, in the cloud they can find additional services such as raw storage (saved texts, images, videos, applications, backups, etc.) and applications (e-mail, Office tools). In addition to the analysis of technological and market trends, several recommendations for organizations are made, and they are inclined to take an agile approach in adapting to new technological services. Being prepared for an ever-changing cloud landscape, organizations will be better positioned to take full advantage of emerging peer technologies. References Danda, R. R. (2023).

Asymmetric risk contagion effect of the interaction between the real economy and the financial sector—an analysis based on the domestic commodity price index,"Abstract As the uncertainty of the global economy intensifies, domestic real economy risks and financial risks may interact and worsen under international risk shocks. Commodity prices are an important channel for transmitting international economic and financial risks. Taking January 2007 to July 2021 as the sample period and using data from nine commodity price indices and banking, diversified finance, and insurance industry indices, this article uses rolling regression method to construct different commodity price risk and financial sector risk indicators. Combined with a vector autoregressive model, the risk contagion effect is calculated. The analysis indicates that there exist significant asymmetric risk contagion effects between various commodities (with energy and steel having the largest risk spillover effects) and there are significant net risk spillover effects on financial sectors (with insurance having the largest risk spillover effect). There are asymmetric risk contagion effects among different financial sectors, with varying degrees of risk spillover effects on commodity prices (with the banking sector having the greatest risk spillover effects on commodity prices and other financial sectors, and diversified finance having the greatest risk spillover effect on commodities). During major global financial events, the risk spillover effects of commodities and input effects increase significantly due to the intensification of the risk spillover effects of energy, steel, and nonferrous metals. The risk spillover effect between commodities and the overall risk spillover effect have significantly increased. The financial sector’s overall net risk input effect has increased, while the net risk input effect of the insurance sector has also increased. These findings are significant for improving systemic financial risk monitoring indicators and adopting accurate prevention and control measures.",2025-01-09,
The Resilience of Green Bonds During Market Turmoil: Implications for Investors and Policymakers,"ABSTRACT Despite significant growth, green bonds comprise less than 1% of the conventional bonds market, and more research is needed to determine their role as diversifiers, hedges or safe havens. In compliance. This study examines the co‐movement between green bonds and various financial markets (stocks, commodities, digital currencies, bonds and foreign exchange) before and during COVID‐19, using daily data from 28/11/2008 to 21/3/2022 and using quantile‐based analysis. The findings based on quantile‐on‐quantile regression confirm an asymmetric/non‐linear association between green bonds and other financial markets before COVID‐19, with the association varying depending on market conditions, such as bearish, normal and bullish. During the COVID‐19 period, a robust negative correlation is identified between green bonds and other financial markets, affirming the safe‐haven role of green bonds against broader financial markets. These findings have important policy implications for investors, fund managers and policymakers. For increased diversification, investors in conventional and Islamic equities, commodities, conventional bonds, Sukuk markets, virtual and foreign currency markets can find it advantageous to include green bonds as a protection to downside risk.",2025-01-09,
Resilience to Avert Financial and Economic Crisis in Islamic Economics Framework,"This study analyses the institutions as rules and organizations in Islamic economics and financial framework to deal with economics and financial crisis. It explains that Islamic economic and financial system has a role for markets, but the asset and goods markets are closely synchronized with real economy-based commodity and fund flows. Islamic economics framework avoids the situation of glut and deflation with careful evaluation of investment projects with wide risk sharing. Islamic rules and norms of trade emphasize on commitment in contracts which is strengthened through rules regarding necessity of assuming ownership, possession, and risk before entering in trade contracts. Avoidance of excessive non-asset-based leverage reduces the risk of both firms and investors. Prohibition of speculative trades and a check on artificial liquidity and leverage-based trading helps in checking asset price bubbles. Rewards are matched to risk, and the risk has to be borne by all capital providers with prohibition of Riba. Finally, 'beyond-market stabilizers' help in wealth and income redistribution irrespective of the phase of business cycle. Thus, Islamic economics framework is more resilient to avert crisis and deal with it through its set of commercial and social finance institutions and business ethics.",2025-01-08,
The Image of Women in Arab Theater Between Feminism and Sexuality: A Case Study of the Play “The Mask”,"This research investigates the question of who is responsible for crafting the image of women in Arab theater. It presents a comprehensive panorama of the topic across the Arab world before delving into a case study from Jordan: the play “The Mask” by Jordanian playwright Nawal Al-Ali. The research also delves into the themes of sexuality and feminist creativity within Arab theater, questioning whether they represent radicalism or a necessity. It reveals, firstly, that the depiction of women from the dawn of creation has been shaped by the exegesis of sacred texts, casting her in the role of the tempter, portraying women as instruments of sexual allure in numerous works and contexts. Secondly, the study posits that the doctrines of patriarchal authority elucidate the male endeavor to dominate the sexual autonomy of women, their personal assets, and the theater of war, encompassing violence, assault, and enslavement as separate phenomena. The research sample demonstrates that, from the veil to nudity, men have dictated women’s clothing and modesty (or lack thereof) throughout history. Still, Nawal Al-Ali's text does not exhibit extremism; rather, it serves as a wake-up call for women to reclaim their humanity and assert their agency in choosing their own attire, free from the dictates of men. Furthermore, the research demonstrates that globalization and the decline of modernity have reduced women to mere commodities to be exploited by large corporations for financial gain. Therefore, the researcher passionately believes that addressing these issues is not only necessary but also imperative.",2025-01-08,
"Macroeconomic Conditions, Speculation, and Commodity Futures Returns","This paper examines the dynamic relationships between speculative activities, commodity returns, and macroeconomic conditions across five sectors compassing 29 commodities. Using weekly data spanning from January 2000 to July 2023, we construct comprehensive measures of commodity market speculation across five sectors and examine their sector-specific impact on returns through advanced econometric methods, including dynamic conditional correlation models, quantile regressions, Markov-switching models, and time-varying Granger causality tests. Our results reveal that the impact of speculative activities on commodity futures returns is conditional on the commodity sector and prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, the relationship between macroeconomic factors, speculative activities, and commodity futures returns is time varying. Among the macroeconomic variables, the financial stress indicator, as measured by the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index, shows a significant ability to predict commodity futures returns. The relationship between speculation and commodity returns is bi-directional across all sectors.",2025-01-08,

"The Role of Gold ETFs in Market Stability, Price Discovery, and Economic Dynamics during Crises","Gold has been considered one of the most reliable safe-haven assets and a tool for value storage, possessing qualities such as rarity, hardness, and resistance to adverse impacts from economic processes. Under conditions of economic stability, when demand for gold is insignificant, interest rates can be used to bring the price of gold under control; therefore, investors would rather take positions in interest-bearing securities. Most global disruptions, especially the financial crisis in 2008, the 2011 US Debt, and the COVID-19 pandemic, further heightened uncertainty and volatility in gold prices. The increased volatility stoked concerns over the stability and reputation of gold as an investment. In fact, it was in the year 2003 that gold exchange-traded funds started to turn gold as a physical commodity into a more available, liquid, and diversified financial instrument. Gold ETFs track physical gold, mining operations, or leverage-based products, which provide access to investors for ""paper gold"" without problems related to custody, insurance, or safety. In times of higher inflation or currency devaluation, gold ETFs hedge both a loss of purchasing power and overall market risk. Indeed, the empirical data show that the surge of investors into gold ETFs during the two systemic crises of the 2008 financial collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand, and hence prices for this commodity. While, at any given time, market-fragmenting gold ETFs foster stabilization through immediate liquidity provided to support price discovery, over increasing demand on that part is depressing economic activities: with high gold prices soaring to reflect hikes in the cost of borrowings, interest rates kill off investments, consumption, and growth. What results is a complex equilibrium since while gold ETFs protect an investor from turbulence in general, the reverse is a case that contributes to instability during widespread economic adversity. Policymakers and regulators should attach great importance to the interconnections among the performance of the gold ETFs, trends in the stability of a market, and economic outlook. If there is transparent regulation, decent trading systems might help in promoting confidence in using these instruments. Gold ETFs have become key methods of risk and portfolio diversification management besides facilitating investors over times of potential financial crisis. Their impact necessitates continued vigilance and additional oversight. Leveraging off the 2008 financial collapse, the COVID-19 pandemic, and a set of historical case studies, this paper uses empirical evidence related to changes in the price of gold and investor behavior in order to study the emergence and multidimensional role that gold ETFs have played so far within modern financial markets. The present study will be important as it explores their impact on price stability, the diversification of risk, and the greater implications for economic growth and suppression. This paper, therefore, contributes to the nuances surrounding gold's status as a safe-haven asset and potential trade-offs between using gold ETFs as tools for hedging and portfolio management.",2025-01-07,
The political effects of the Russian-Ukraine war on international trade,"The Russian-Ukrainian war, an unprecedented geopolitical event, has triggered profound and far-reaching consequences for international trade. This paper examines the political effects of the conflict on global trade, with a focus on how political decisions, economic sanctions, and realignments among nations are reshaping trade flows and policies. As major exporters of energy, grain, and essential raw materials, Russia and Ukraine have long been integral to global supply chains. The onset of hostilities has disrupted these chains, resulting in global inflationary pressures, rising food insecurity, and a reevaluation of global economic dependencies. Against this backdrop, the study examined the political effects of the Russian – Ukraine war on international trade. This study adopted the historical and content analysis. It is concerned with an in-depth examination of documented data on the basis of which relevant materials were drawn. This study was anchored on the Geoeconomic Power Theory which provides a robust framework for understanding the political effects of the Russian-Ukrainian war on international trade by emphasizing the strategic use of economic tools such as sanctions, trade shifts, and market control, as a primary instrument of geopolitical influence. The data collected for this study was synthesize and analyzed using trend analysis techniques. This study revealed that disruption of supply chains, rising commodity prices, changes in trade relationships, economic consequences, agricultural markets and food security, reorientation of global trade, international trade and sanctions and energy market dynamics were the major impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian war on global trade flows. This study found that sanctions reshape trade dynamics, reconfigure partnerships, drive covert economies, and impact long-term global trade structures. The study also showed that the most significant impacts of long-term consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian war on international trade policies were shift from globalization to regionalization, rise of economic blocs and fragmentation, impact on global supply chains and resource security, growth of alternative financial and payment systems, sanctions as a tool of foreign policy, challenges to multilateral trade governance and emergence of resilience and self-sufficiency policies. This study concluded that the political effects of the Russian-Ukrainian war serve as a critical reminder of the intricate interplay between politics and trade. Finally, this study recommended among others that global policy-makers should develop a real-time trade monitoring system that tracks fluctuations in trade volumes and routes affected by the Russian-Ukrainian war. This system should leverage advanced data analytics to identify and predict shifts in global trade flows, enabling businesses to respond proactively to emerging trends.",2025-01-07,

Economic Outcomes from Reliance on Foreign Capital: Taking South Korean and Brazils Crises in the 1990s as Examples,"This article analyzes the economic crises of South Korea in 1997 and Brazil in 1999, focusing on the two countries' reliance on foreign capital and their recovery policies under the leadership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Both countries suffered severe currency devaluation and economic recession due to capital flight. However, with different economic structures and response policies, the recovery paths of the two countries are also very different. South Korea had benefited from an export-led recovery and sweeping financial reforms, while commodity-dependent Brazil faced more challenges. This study provides an important reference for emerging economies dealing with foreign investment dependence and post-crisis recovery issues. This article specifically analyzes key economic indicators such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows, per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and exchange rate fluctuations during the economic crisis in South Korea and Brazil, and conducts an in-depth comparison of the two countries' policies to respond to the crisis. Finally, this article puts forward specific countermeasures and suggestions such as diversifying the industrial structure, strengthening the independence of monetary policy, and improving public trust to deal with possible financial instability in the future.",2025-01-03,

The purpose of the study is to analyze between inflation persistence before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in West Sumatra Province. The variables used in this study include general inflation and commodity group inflation. This study uses a univariate autoregressive (AR) approach with monthly inflation time series data for 2017-2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2021-2023 (post-pandemic). Data obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics of West Sumatra. The results showed that the persistence rate of general inflation before and after the pandemic was in a controlled category with an average length of time back to its natural level of less than one month. All commodity group inflation variables such as processed food, housing, health, and education are in the low inflation persistence category with the length of time to return to its natural level of less than 3 months both before and after the pandemic. The results are different for the inflation variables of the transportation, communication, and financial services commodity groups which have a low inflation persistence rate before the pandemic, but high after the COVID-19 pandemic with a length of time to return to its natural level of 8.09 months. This research is expected to help policy makers in formulating strategic steps to maintain inflation and regional economic stability.",2025-01-03,
A Proposal to Create a Single Global Cap-and-Trade Scheme to Ensure a Ceiling on Gross CO2 Emissions below a Pre-set Allowable Carbon Budget,"It is time for faithful and trustworthy world leaders to lead in establishing a “Global Cap-and-Trade regulatory framework” to change our course promptly. This framework aims to establish an institutional mechanism that ensures steadily decreasing global emission limits. The Scheme regulates upstream entities that import or produce fossil fuels, with the initiation of countries that share the objective and choose to participate voluntarily, and guides us toward a global carbon-neutral economy. In addition, the Scheme can enable a major global paradigm shift not only for climate issue but also for financing SDGs, and addressing fossil fuel resource concerns, notably: (a) a global emissions cap trajectory setting based on the pre-agreed remaining gross carbon budget to be decided by the CMA of the Paris Agreement; (b) initiated by a highly conscious club of countries and building in incentives for other countries to participate; (c) a fully auctioning upstream-type regulatory scheme with a single market of international allowance as a new energy commodity [for supply-side of fossil fuels]; (d) a uniform—theoretically ideal—international carbon pricing scheme to realise the minimum cost (and no need for the border adjustment), as an external common factor, while it respects national sovereignty [for demand-side of energy]; (e) becoming an economic framework with no need for awareness of CO2 ceiling explicitly [for demand-side of energy]; (f) generation of a trillion-dollar auctioning proceeds stream—equivalent to an agreed amount of total financial transfer at the COP29—for financing SDGs and regressive mitigation for low-income people, and incentivising developing countries for participation; (g) together with a carbon crediting scheme enabling fossil fuel production without limitation by carbon capture and storage (CCS) [for supply-side of fossil fuels]; and (h) enhanced fossil fuels predictability for production investment [supply-side] and effective utilisation [demand-side] under clear rules with a price stabilisation effect. We look forward to the strong will of current world leaders for future generations.",2025-01-03,
Financial Stability Implications of Policy Mix in a Small Open CommodityExporting Economy,"In this paper, we study how systematic monetary policy under inflation targeting in a commodity-exporting economy not fully isolated from commodity price volatility by fiscal policy may contribute to financial instability by fueling the credit cycle when commodity prices increase or by amplifying the credit crunch when commodity prices decline. We report several empirical observations that illustrate the potential procyclicality (relative to credit developments) of inflation targeting policy where commodity price fluctuations are the main drivers of macroeconomic developments. Namely, we find that relative prices in commodity-exporting economies are much more volatile than in other countries. The length of periods when relative prices grow or decline is comparable to the monetary policy horizon of most inflation targeters (2-3 years). Note that the central banks that target inflation, including those of the commodity-exporting countries, usually target the headline CPI. This index accommodates relative price changes by design. We proceed with formal statistical testing using panel structural VARs and local projection models. The tests support the procyclicality of inflation targeting, but only in a group of emerging market economies, which in practice have more procyclical fiscal policy than advanced economies: monetary policy eases in response to a higher price of an exported commodity while real credit grows. Counterfactual exercises show that endogenous monetary policy responses to commodity shocks explain around 20% on average of the real credit growth in a group of commodity exporting countries for which the reaction of policy rates to commodity shocks is statistically significant. We cross-check the empirical findings by reviewing a collection of papers with estimated DSGE models and analysing impulse responses of real policy rates to commodity price changes. We also conduct a theoretical analysis and compare stabilization properties (while accounting for financial stability risks) of the inflation-targeting policy rule and the ‘leaning against the wind’ policy rules. Notably, we do this exercise conditionally on the role of commodity price shocks for the economy. For this purpose, we use the DSGE with financial frictions and a banking sector estimated basing for the Russian economy and measure the efficiency of policy results with different sensitivity to credit developments (the ‘leaning against the wind’ rules) under different variance of oil price shocks (which may be interpreted also as different efficiency of fiscal policy in insulating the economy from a given oil price volatility). Results show that when commodity price volatility is relatively high (fiscal policy is not countercyclical), leaning against the wind outperforms pure inflation targeting, thus supporting our empirical findings. Interestingly, even when the financial stability risks associated with the volatility of credit developments are negligible, a moderate leaning against the wind policy is still preferable. As policy implication, we point that a commodity-exporting economy should have countercyclical fiscal policy for inflation targeting to become countercyclical in a commodity cycle.",2025-01-01,
Single‐use materials and poorly recycled waste in intensive care: An argument for improving sustainability,"Intensive care unit (ICU) clinical items and packaging made from plastic, paper and other (mixed) materials have a significant environmental impact.1 These products are energy-intensive and generate a large carbon footprint and high levels of air pollution due to raw materials extraction, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal. Paper, glass and metal (steel, aluminium, etc.) pose less of a long-term threat than plastics because they can be relatively easily recycled and recycled almost indefinitely. This critical commentary offers a materials scientist perspective regarding the over-reliance on single-use plastic products and poor recycling in ICU settings to enable critical care nurses and their multi-disciplinary colleagues to understand the composition of health care products better. With improved knowledge about plastics and materials making up the clinical items used daily in ICUs, nurses will be more equipped to contribute to sustainable procurement and waste management, which are important aspects of national strategies to become a net zero health care system.2 In the United Kingdom, there is also now a 'Design for Life roadmap' providing national expectations to radically reduce single-use plastics in health care and maximize reuse, remanufacture and recycling.3 Plastics are wonderfully malleable and adaptable materials, with the physics term 'plastic' referring to the material's ability to be extensively deformed before breakage. The term is assumed to cover a single type of material, although the collective term includes more than 200 distinct chemical compounds. Traditional or conventional plastics are more correctly referred to as petrochemical-derived plastic (PDP) because they are wholly or in part derived from oil and natural gas. Plastics are polymers of linked single units or 'string-like' entities of varying molecular size (between tens of thousands to many millions). The bulk materials are also functionalized by incorporating additives, such as endocrine-disrupting plasticisers and preservatives, which can leach from the material. Plastics are a favoured material because they are cheap, versatile, easily shaped, accessible and chemically inert. PDPs offer physical protection against water, air, impact, distortion and temperature. Their chemical inertness is a threat and a ""double-edged sword"" in that it can lead to environmental persistence. The desirable properties of plastics include water repellence, mechanical toughness, rigidity and protection. ICU waste comes from many product types—consider how many clinical items are used daily, such as intravenous fluid bags and tubing, incontinence pads, syringes, sharps, medicine containers, personal protective equipment (PPE), catheters and supplies for ventilation, nutrition, suctioning and procedural packs (and the list could go on). Each item and its packaging contain many different materials, showing the complexity of the composition of health care products, and most with considerable amounts of plastics. For example, a syringe and needle consist of four types of plastic (polyethylene, PVC, polypropylene, cyclic olefin), rubber, paper, stainless steel and silicone oil lubricant across the device, container and wrapper. Plastic waste accounts for a significant amount of ICU waste, the majority of which is single-use plastic; however, plastic cannot be recycled for the same purposes very well. Consequently, any plastic waste can only be up-cycled and repurposed. Typically, this involves embedding the plastic waste throughout other materials, such as cement for the construction industries or a combination of molten plastic with sawdust, cotton fibre or sand to make composite materials for paving, fencing or furniture. Upon recycling, plastics undergo thermally-induced chain scission, consequently degenerating in quality. Other issues associated with SUPs and PDPs are materials supply from a finite resource and the lack of longer-term sustainability. In addition, the incineration of plastics liberates CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), exacerbating climate change. Upon landfill-disposal, paper and other compostable substances liberate methane (CH4), and materials such as nylon and food waste liberate nitrous oxide (N2O) and related oxides, referred to as NOx gases. These three specific gases are important because CO2 constitutes approximately 80% of all GHG emissions, while the other two account for 17%. CO2 is ascribed a global warming potential (GWP) value (over 100 years of persistence) of 1.0, while CH4 and N2O have GWP values that are 32 times and 280 times higher, respectively. This means 1 gram of CH4 is 32 times, and N2O 280 times, more influential in global warming than 1 gram of CO2. Nitrous oxide also has the impact of destroying atmospheric ozone, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet light.4 Some recovery of the initial required energy to make the product can be obtained by energy recovery processes (incineration and recovery of some fraction of generated heat). However, this lies outside of a circular economy and generates GHGs that cause a rise in baseline GWP. Another strategy could involve sequestering and storage of materials, but again, this is a short-sighted view and only a short-term fix. Similarly, crude treatment and recovery of plastic materials give rise to modified materials with inferior chemical and physical or mechanical properties. Recycling policy can use the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) to reduce the number of new materials needed and the energy and pollution associated with this new or virgin material. Currently, only paper, metals and glass fare well during recycling. Polyester (PET) is the only plastic to be recycled multiple times without losing its valued properties.5 However, PET still has some limitations, with an estimated maximum of three to seven recycling cycles before it becomes unsuitable (poor and unworkable). Plastics degrade in the open air and seas due to oxygen-related oxidative change and mechanical action. This embrittling of the materials makes them subject to fragmentation and debriding, forming particles with sizes less than 5 mm width, referred to as microplastics. Very small versions of microplastics, called nano-particulates, are absorbed by marine flora and fauna and, therefore, indirectly into human bodies via the digestive tract.6 New evidence points to the disruptive action of these nanoplastics on human fertility, the endocrine system, the immune system, hepatotoxicity, nerve malfunction and oncogenesis.7 Given the persistence of plastics in the environment (air, land and sea) for an estimated 350–650 years, plastics accumulating in soil, air and ocean floor represent a real threat to ecosystems and humankind alike. Alternatives to PDPs include a range of short-lived (1–2 years) mixed materials, often called bioplastics or biopolymer composites. These commodities can use agricultural wastes, including sustainably sourced starting materials such as cellulose, starch, glycerol, bio-detergents and various plant oils or waxes. Plant oils or waxes can make the material more water-repellent. New candidates for such bioplastics include pressed dried plant cellulose, highly-compressed wood pulp, called glassine or heated starches and materials made from the products of microbial fermentation, such as polylactic acid (PLA)—lactic acid being the acid present in yoghurt. PLA is the cheapest of the most expensive mass-produced bioplastics on a weight-used basis at £1.6/kg compared with £3.2/kg for most other biopolymers; however, these costs are more expensive than £1.0–1.1/kg for almost all PDPs, creating a financial barrier.5 Bioplastics also have other environmental impacts when considering the full life cycle8 due to land use, pesticides, energy consumption, water use, greenhouse gas emissions, biodegradability and recyclability, although research to resolve these other issues indicates promise for bioplastics to potentially have a role in replacing traditional plastics.9 Other alternatives to current practice include re-engineering the thick walling of films, bottles and closures using supporting ridges, struts and baffles and ""light weighting"" to redesign and adjust the packaging to reduce its weight and waste produced.10 Substitution of the SUP polyethylene apron and other forms of PPE with waxed paper or glassine that can be rinsed, sterilized and recycled is another possibility. With its waxy character, calendar-rolled paper (called glassine) is an excellent replacement for plastic film. The material is converted back to wood pulp fibre after prolonged soaking in hot water and re-casting. The material degrades when buried in a matter of years rather than the many centuries of PDPs. Medical trays, holders, vessels and packaging for catering packs can also be made from recyclable and compostable paper. All health care departments, including resource-intensive areas like ICUs, produce large volumes of waste and must reconsider how plastics and plastic-based materials are currently used to find alternative solutions. Research and industry must collaborate to establish abundant, cheap alternative materials to PDPs. Where products need to be of single use, the materials should have identical or near-identical properties to those currently used yet be universally collected and recycled for similar or alternative use. Collection and processing of ICU waste must ensure alternatives to mass incineration and careful handling or disposal to limit entry into the natural environment. Preventing landfill-disposed waste from entering rivers, lakes, coastal water and deep-sea will avoid environmental persistence. There needs to be an urgent, collective, powerful drive to replace materials in health care clinical items, including those used in ICUs, with more reusable products and increased recycling when single-use product is required. As a large section of the health care workforce, this commentary calls out to critical care nurses to engage and collaborate with materials science, design, waste management and sustainability researchers to provide a valuable nursing perspective during this shift towards more environmentally sustainable ICU supplies.

“They Get Zero Say in How We View It”: Ex-Mormon TikTok as Spectacle,"In late 2022, a trend took over TikTok wherein users repeatedly made the Italian che vuoi or ""pinched fingers"" hand gesture while offering a tour of their homes to the soundtrack of Louis Prima's ""Che La Luna."" Often, these videos showed off niche elements of the user's culture, such as ""things in my Deaf household that just make sense,"" ""things in my lesbian moms' household that just make sense,"" or ""things in my Pentecostal grandmother's house that just make sense."" For many ex-Mormon users, this trend presented an opportunity to showcase the physical relics of their transition out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Several popular ex-Mormon TikTok creators offered tours of ""Things in My Ex-Mormon Household that Just Make Sense."" Wandering through the house, they panned the camera to their dusty scriptures, desk drawers full of Moroni sculptures, and framed devotional artwork that they could neither bear to display nor throw away. Commenters on the videos shared their own fraught relationship with physical reminders of their former faith: bags to transport temple clothing that have been repurposed as sleepover packs for their children, scriptures that have been moved to the fiction sections of their bookshelves, and religious artwork that has been installed ironically over their newly established kitchen coffee stations.Other ex-Mormons provide viewers shock value by displaying and making strange material relics of their former lives. Users often juxtapose their intimate knowledge of an item's ""official"" use—for example, dressing in temple garments or leafing through the Book of Mormon to find a specific passage—with verbal or visual cues signaling their rejection of those beliefs. Some pin their missionary name tags to clothing that does not conform to the LDS Church's modesty standards, or don their full missionary outfit while drinking coffee or alcohol. In each of these examples, TikTok users' videos blur the line between the digital and the material in the same way they unsettle prevailing assumptions about the authority and meaning of religious objects. In other words, they use the tools of spectacle to alter real-world conditions.Using theoretical critiques of screen culture as a one-way relationship that always separates and disempowers spectators, this essay examines how ex-Mormons use TikTok as a tool to reckon with their relationship to Mormon faith and culture. A debate between Mormon and ex-Mormon TikTok content creators about the appropriate way for de-converts to interact with and share information about sacred objects serves as my case study. I argue that technological advances allowing users to ""speak back"" to and through the screen require us to reconsider existing theories of spectacle as a one-way source of power and control.Guy Debord and other theorists have posited the spectacle of the screen as a scourge on the modern world, describing spectacle as ""antidialectical"" and as a ""social hallucination.""1 I propose that studying ex-Mormons' use of TikTok to define, share, and hone their (and others') changing beliefs and practices complicates existing theory on spectacle and adds new insights to theories on the dynamic between religious practitioner and authority. Far from being antidialectical, one might picture the relationship between ex-Mormons and the objects and discourses of their faith as a scramble crosswalk, involving ties and detachments of meaning between religious authorities, the past devotional self, the current self, and the future or ideal self. I also hope to spark further academic conversation about how contemporary social media platforms' audiovisual capacities and limitations might redefine the bounds of a contemporary American society of spectacle, especially as it relates to religious authority and meaning-making.In many ways, Guy Debord's foundational 1967 work on the theory of spectators and the spectacular, The Society of the Spectacle, anticipated many of the twenty-first-century critiques leveled at social media use and smartphone culture. Debord describes spectacle—loosely defined as the bombardment of one-way visual stimuli that has come to characterize twentieth- and twenty-first-century entertainment and social life—as not just a ""distortion of the visual world,"" but ""a weltanshauung that has been actualized, translated into the material realm—a world view transformed into an objective force.""2 What is the aim of that objective force? For Debord, the spectacle is a vampire, feeding on the real and replacing it with a series of prefigured representations. It is not ""something added to the real world. . . . It is the very heart of society's unreal reality.""3 In other words, to think about Mormonism as a ""spectacle"" is not simply to examine how the faith is characterized through exaggeration or distortion. Instead, one might consider spectacle as a foundational force in modern life—one that sensationalizes and makes ""unreal"" any subject in its grasp.As a tool that ""atomizes and manipulates"" individuals, supplanting real social relations while pretending to facilitate them, the spectacle can be a tool of immense hegemonic power.4 It provides the illusion of leisure time while stymying opportunities for activities outside the matrix of labor production. It promotes isolation that further fuels the necessity of goods that reinforce that isolation. It naturalizes capitalist ideologies to the point that those ideologies take on the form of unquestioned reality. The situation, Debord warned in 1967, is dire: ""Imprisoned in a flattened universe bounded by the screen of the spectacle, behind which his own life has been exiled, the spectator's consciousness no longer knows anyone but the fictitious interlocutors who subject him to a one-way monologue about their commodities and the politics of their commodities.""5 Debord's proposed solution to the social ruin wrought by the society of the spectacle lay in the long game. Social theorists must continue to hone their critiques of authoritarian systems and hope that doing so ultimately reveals to the masses the hegemonic forces depriving them of true community and true leisure. ""A critique seeking to go beyond the spectacle,"" Debord concluded, ""must know how to wait.""6The intervening years since Debord's exhortation have seen an absolute explosion of technological innovation and a massive transformation in how (and how often) people around the world use screens. In 1994—the year of Debord's death—CERN held the first International World Wide Web Conference and the Web had garnered ten million users.7 By 2023, 90 percent of Americans over the age of eighteen owned an Internet-connected smartphone and a third of them had used it to access TikTok.8 In the social media age, many of Debord's worst fears have come to pass: top social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok all incorporate opportunities to shop from within the app, and the normalization of ads and data mining keep the true ""costs"" of participating in social media largely hidden from consumers. Critical appraisals of spectacle as ""the mass management of attentiveness and its commodification"" have perhaps found their apotheosis in platforms like TikTok, where billions of available videos facilitate endless scrolling and tracking pixels follow users' off-app web use to maximize the data the company siphons from users.9And yet the widespread availability of smartphones and the accessible video-making features on apps like TikTok also push back against critiques of the spectatorship as a ""one-way relationship"" that only ""simulate[s] the illusion of choices and 'interactivity.'""10 Indeed, for all its pitfalls, social media can allow users to speak back to the powerful, thus refusing the terms of a one-way relationship. Such interaction, far from being illusory, has real-world consequences that might even spur greater consciousness among the masses of the systems of power in which they operate. This potential is especially salient for organizations like the LDS Church, whose strong central authority system has never been more open to public pushback than it has been in the age of social media. Discontented former members need not even have their own large Internet following in order to make their voices heard—they merely need to capitalize on the right social media trend at the right time.TikTok, the China-based social media app that was released worldwide in August 2018, is a free, video-based platform that allows users to develop a following, engage with and remix others' content, and even sell products through an app-based ""TikTok shop."" While the success or failure of any given social media platform relies on a mix of tangible and intangible forces, what initially set TikTok apart from other video-based platforms like juggernauts YouTube and Snapchat was its sophisticated in-app video editing opportunities and its emphasis on remixing and repurposing others' audio and video. Users can ""stitch"" their videos with others' content as a way of ""talking back,"" adding on to a point from the original video, or even answering a prompt-style video that was always intended to live on in others' stitched productions. TikTok ""duets"" allow users to fill their own video with picture-in-a-picture blocks of others', a phenomenon that TikTok creators have used to literally duet, singing in harmony with other creators, to expand the visual scope of another person's video creatively, and even to add extra visual interest to their own audio-heavy content. Any user can make their video's audio ""shareable,"" resulting in the proliferation of certain ""viral"" sounds that repurpose others' original audio in countless other contexts.On December 12, 2022, Latter-day Saint TikTok creator Spencer Marsh experienced the full force of TikTok's video remixing capacities when he released a video addressed to the ex-Mormon TikTok community. Marsh, responding to the proliferation of ex-Mormon che vuoi videos showcasing sacred garments and other religious objects, made a personal plea to ex-believers to respect his faith by deleting their videos. In his video, Marsh acknowledged that many ex-Mormons shared their stories of leaving the church due to immense hurt and disappointment and added that he knew he and other Latter-day Saint TikTok creators had failed to show ex-Mormons respect. Nevertheless, Marsh declared his goal in making this video was to persuade ex-Mormons to show more respect for their former faith by avoiding the ""lampooning of the sacred"" and keeping sacred rituals and items off of the app: Argue against the divinity of the temple, share your hard experiences from the temple, share with me some of your hard experiences—I'm willing to be a listening ear. I'm willing to be in your—I'm willing to make friends with you and to be in your circle of support to help you maybe deal with some of the hard things you've gone through as far as the church is concerned. Just keep Temple robes and other sacred content that you guys know about off this app and off of social media in general. And please create a culture within the ex-Mormon community in which this type of thing is not tolerated.11Marsh's appeal quickly dispersed through the ecosystem of ex-Mormon TikTok, with a number of creators stitching the original video with their own commentary. Some kept their refutations of Marsh's request short and simple, including an account that responded with a sign that read ""Go fuck yourself.""12 Others engaged with Marsh's request sentence by sentence, affirming what they understood to be their right to treat their own experiences and objects with any level of reverence they wanted. ""They put [a] price on that info and we paid it for years,"" one creator responded.13Debates about ownership—of both material temple garments and the experiences they symbolize—are a significant aspect of many ex-Mormon TikTokers' attempts to reject the authority of the church and claim their right to repurpose, reconsider, and share objects and rituals previously understood to be sacred—and, necessarily, secret. As Colleen McDannell has written, for example, temple garments represent a ""flexible boundary line.""14 On the one hand, garments worn flush against the body at all times serve as a reminder of the strict boundaries that separate members from non-members and of the control and authority the institution of the LDS Church holds over members' very bodies. On the other hand, because of the private nature of the garments—both in terms of how they are worn and how they are talked about (or not talked about) by Latter-day Saint leaders—individual members are largely free to assign their own meanings and significance to the garments, choosing whether and how to wear them is both a deeply personal choice and a symbol of belonging to something larger than oneself.In this way, an ex-member's decision to shed their garments is a profoundly personal decision and a symbolic stepping away from their former faith community. TikTok has become a site for ex-Mormons to speak openly about their conflicting emotions regarding their garments, creating a shared narrative not emblematic of ex-Mormons' unanimous views on what the garments mean but emphasizing their collective insistence that they have the right to speak openly about what they once felt obligated to keep private.Several themes emerged in ex-Mormons' responses to Marsh's open message. One was an appeal to ex-Mormons' right to treat their garments with any amount of respect they wanted on the grounds that they physically and legally owned the garments. ""If they paid for them, it's their property,"" rejoined user @blessedapostasy in a point-by-point response to Marsh's video.15 One respondent said, ""We paid for those clothes, and for that information.""16 By reducing the value of the garments to their cost of purchase, users symbolically rejected the spiritual value of the garments. Similarly, emphasizing their legal ownership of the garments as property suggested that, rather than recognizing the church and its leaders as ultimate authorities, they were now only beholden to the secular laws governing property and financial disputes. If, as McDannell has argued, religious institutions construct and maintain authority through ""the micromanagement of power,"" ex-Mormons' rejection of the LDS Church's ability to define the sacredness of their garments is also a rejection of the church's institutional power more broadly.17Another theme of ex-Mormons' response to Marsh was a reclamation not just of their physical property but of their right to name and define their own spiritual experiences. By describing their status as former true believers, ex-Mormons laid claim to their experiences in the temple and in the church more broadly as their spiritual property. In an impassioned response to Marsh's video, creator @apostate_adah said: I was born into the church, and so I was taught about the Christian Mormon version of God and believed in him my entire life. Then I go to the temple, the most sacred and holy of places, where I'm going to be covenanting with that God—the God who I was told created me, loves me more than anybody in the whole universe, who understands me, who knows my thoughts and my heart and my intent. The god who has seen my future and knows my potential. The God who I have devoted my life to. The God determining my future, my eternal destiny. The God I am supposed to trust more than myself. . . . So, I put aside anything inside of me and trusted this God. Then I go to the temple, and I watch as God tells Eve that because she was the first to take of the fruit, that she needed to covenant to obey her husband. Therefore, because I am a woman, I need to covenant with my God to harken to my husband while veiling my face—and going home to an abusive husband. I had to listen to that message for ten years and feel like that is how my God thinks of me because I am a woman. And you, Mormon man, think that you have the right to tell me how to process that trauma?18Commenters on the post echoed Adah's sentiment, with one writing, ""The temple ceremony belongs to us just as much as it belongs to them. They get zero say in how we view it and how we share our experience.""19 In her video responding to each aspect of Marsh's message, @blessedapostasy reminded Marsh that garments and temple experiences were also ""things we held sacred.""20 Ex-Mormons' justifications of their right and authority to ""lampoon"" the temple and sacred garments based on evidence of their own former sincere belief highlights what McDannell calls the ""complicated networks of beliefs, values, myths, and social structures"" within which religious objects function.21Even as ex-Mormon TikTokers frame their post-Mormon lives as more authentic and ""real"" than their lives as believing Mormons, they make frequent appeals to the authenticity of their former belief in and involvement with the church. By ""proving"" that their experiences in the temple and their acquisition of their sacred garments were in earnest, ex-Mormons lay claim to their continued right to ""creatively imagine for themselves what the garments are all about.""22 These former ""silent theologians,"" freed of the strictures calling for sacred secrecy around temple garments and rituals, vocalize their theological rejection of the LDS Church out of the authority of their genuine experiences within it.23In his expansion on Guy Debord's theory of the spectacular, Jonathan Crary posits that ""spectacular culture is not founded on the necessity of making a subject see, but rather on strategies in which individuals are isolated, separated, and inhabit time as disempowered.""24 Screens not only demand users' attention, Crary argues, but require them to block out external stimuli to the point that the material world is rendered secondary to nonstop passive intake of visual stimuli. How does one avoid allowing the spectacle to turn them into a ""conscious automaton""?25 Crary suggests spectators must attempt to inhabit what Henri Bergson calls the ""zone of indetermination""—the space between ""awareness of stimulation and reaction to it"" in which one might go beyond reflex or habit and engage in truly creative living.26To creatively inhabit the ""real"" is easier said than done, partly because the screen and its endlessly refreshable stimuli have nestled so deeply into the heart of twenty-first-century life that what happens on the Internet—politically, economically, socially, spiritually—also happens in real life. While apps like TikTok could be said to epitomize some of critics' worst fears of a society ruled by spectacle—ubiquitous, demanding oblivion to external stimuli, cultivating habitual responses, operating according to hidden levers of power, encouraging deeper investment in consumer culture and material goods that amplify loneliness—they also allow spectators to create a spectacle. Through TikTok, ex-Mormon users find new avenues for speaking back to LDS authorities and contesting their former church's boundaries around the use and meaning of devotional objects. This ""talking back"" is not simply another vacant source of distraction that isolates and disempowers the masses. Indeed, I argue, it might be just the thing to focus a spectator's attention on the space between stimulation and reaction. It might just be an invitation to more creative living.",2025-01-01,
A STUDY ON ALMARAI COMPANY IN SAUDI ARABIA: COMMODITY PRICE AND ITS DETERMINANTS,"This study investigates the relationship between commodity prices and internal and external factors affecting Almarai Co. Ltd., a leading food and beverage company in Saudi Arabia. Using annual data from 2013 to 2023 and employing linear regression analysis, the study categorizes the impact of commodity price risks into three models: internal factors, external factors, and combined factors. The findings reveal that external factors, particularly interest rates, unemployment, and GDP growth rates, are the most significant drivers of commodity price variations, while internal factors such as return on equity, operational ratio, and operating margin exhibit moderate influence. Model 2, which focuses on external factors, demonstrates the highest explanatory power with an Adjusted R Square of 96%, underscoring the critical role of macroeconomic indicators in shaping commodity prices. The study concludes with recommendations for Almarai to adopt hedging strategies, diversify suppliers, monitor economic indicators, and enhance financial risk management to mitigate commodity price risks effectively.",2025-01-01,
A Relational Approach to Energy Retrofitting Through Cooperative Management: Insights from the French Context Aurore Dudka-Postdoctoral Researcher-University of Trento,"Download This Paper Open PDF in Browser Add Paper to My Library Share: Permalink Using these links will ensure access to this page indefinitely Copy URL A Relational Approach to Energy Retrofitting Through Cooperative Management: Insights from the French Context Aurore Dudka-Postdoctoral Researcher-University of Trento 30 Pages Posted: 10 Jan 2025 See all articles by Aurore DudkaAurore Dudkaaffiliation not provided to SSRN Abstract At a time when cooperatives are increasingly taking on general interest missions through mechanisms like solidarity funds, this study examines how these initiatives engage members and clients to contribute financial resources or volunteer time to combat energy poverty. Drawing on Viviana Zelizer's ""circuits of commerce"" framework, applied to collective action and using qualitative analysis, including focus groups and semi-structured interviews (N=23) in the French context with a main focus on the artisan cooperative Cabestan, the findings reveal how cooperatives integrate successfully social and moral dimensions into their practices through a relational approach to address energy retrofitting for vulnerable households. By reframing economic transactions as a means to foster and strengthen social bonds while deepening community engagement rooted in collective responsibility, cooperatives promote both horizontal and vertical collaboration with local actors to address energy poverty. These efforts give rise to what is termed a ""circuit of commons,"" redefining energy retrofitting as not merely a market commodity but also a fundamental right. In terms of recommendations, the study emphasizes the critical need for policy support to foster grassroots solidarity, including long-term funding, robust insurance frameworks, structured mechanisms for volunteer and one-stop-shop models which address broader socio-economic challenges through energy retrofitting.

Forecast of Agricultural Commodity Price in the Presence of Volatility,"Modelling and forecasting of the sale price of an agricultural commodity in the presence of volatility is the focus of this work. Effort has been made to build an efficient forecasting model using the observed data on monthly onion prices for the period of January, 2003 to December, 2020. Non-stationarity and volatility are apparent in the price data observed in the commodity market as these prices are influenced by increasing demand, financial crisis, cross-sectional price variability. Considering all the above conditions, it is found that AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model is suitable for forecasting the volatility present in the observed data set. The forecast of price as well as the conditional variance suggest that the volatility would be apparent and remain constant for upto June 2024. Forecast values of price of onion show a steadily decreasing trend which indicates that the price for a period of 24-months for the season 2023-24 shows some degree of stability. Thus, the onion cultivators of Bolpur market may earn more revenue by selling their produce as early as possible so that they can avoid the extra expense which will incur in storing the same for a long period.",2025-01-01,
Salaries in Science: Dynamics and Priorities of Soviet Policy,"This article characterises the salary changes in the field of science during the Soviet period. The author puts forward a hypothesis that the changes in salaries fixed in regulatory documents reflect long-term trends in science policy and conscious decisions of the authorities to distribute resources between different groups (qualification, territorial, representatives of academic, university, and branch science, etc.). Characterising changes in salaries, the author concludes that 1) in Soviet science, the dominant line was not the individual economic motivation of a researcher, but the support of research teams affiliated with the sector (academic, university, branch science) or particular organisation; 2) the processes of stratification of the Soviet scientific community were of a hidden nature, implying the absence of a competitive distribution of resources, i. e. attempts to stimulate the individual efficiency of scientists were of a “punitive” rather than “incentive” nature; 3) wage regulation was an ineffective tool of scientific policy in conditions of the discrepancy between real and nominal wages in the field of science, inflationary processes, differences in the commodity value of the rouble for different groups, and the lack of transparency in the Soviet economy. In this respect, the assessment of the principle of material incentives for labour in science should be of a comprehensive nature, taking into account the whole range of practices of both financial and social and welfare support of science. The study draws upon a wide range of sources from the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History, including those introduced into the academic circulation for the first time.",2025-01-01,
COMMODITY PRICING THROUGH CRISES. A TIME-VARYING TRANSITION PROBABILITY MARKOV SWITCHING ANALYSIS,"The pricing of six highly liquid futures commodity contracts is investigated using a Markov switching procedure. The data set spans an exceptionally turbulent time period, characterized by a complex interplay of economic/financial and political shocks. Markov switching analysis exploits time series nonlinearity in order to identify the nature and the timing of the implicit changes of regime. Building on a HAM framework, we use the time varying parameterization of the transition probability estimates in order to link these shifts to exogenous variables. We provide in this way additional information on the co-movement of the time series and on their regime shifts, eventally conducive to herding pricing behavior. The WTI oil futures price and DJIA stock index are used as proxies for global shocks as they turn out to be the main common drivers of the changes in regime of most futures commodity prices.",2025-01-01,
The ReFi Movement in Web3: Implications for the Global Commons,"'ReFi' is a rapidly emerging movement in the web3 space that seeks to leverage blockchain technology and decentralized finance protocols to deliver positive real-world impact. While ReFi is short for regenerative finance, regenerative practitioners query the regenerative claims of the movement. This perspective article explains why the regenerative claims of the ReFi movement are under scrutiny and highlights the implications for the Global Commons if the movement does not adhere to regenerative principles. Given that ReFi is a blockchain-enabled movement, the impact of ReFi on the Global Commons is implicitly a blockchain-related concern. This article provides a regenerative practitioner's perspective on the ReFi movement as a point of reference for blockchain practitioners in the ReFi movement seeking to be a force for good. Long-standing research in ecological economics highlights the negative impacts of over-financializaton and commoditization on the natural world. Given that blockchain technology enables more of the world's natural assets to become commoditized, securitized, and collateralized than ever before, the article asserts that DeFi's drive to financialize everything could make the Global Commons the next, and final, commodity frontier. It also asserts that the ReFi movement has the potential to reverse this trend if it can genuinely adhere to the regenerative paradigm.",2025-01-01,
Challenges of Estimating Future Liabilities of Asset Retirement Obligations in Upstream Oil and Gas: A Literature Review,"Summary Estimating asset retirement obligations (AROs) in the upstream oil and gas sector is a complex and critical issue, driven by the need to account for long-term liabilities associated with decommissioning infrastructures, such as offshore platforms and wells. This literature review examines the multifaceted challenges involved in predicting future ARO liabilities, focusing on the technical, financial, regulatory, and environmental uncertainties that complicate accurate estimation. The review explores key accounting frameworks, including International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), which guide the recognition and measurement of AROs, and highlights the significant impact of regulatory changes, fluctuating commodity prices and evolving environmental standards on cost predictions. Environmental factors, such as climate change and ecosystem sensitivity, further exacerbate the difficulty of estimating decommissioning costs, while technological advancements offer both opportunities and uncertainties. In addition, the review assesses financial considerations, including discount rate assumptions and currency fluctuations, which introduce variability in financial reporting and risk assessment. This review identifies key strategies to mitigate risks associated with ARO underestimation, such as scenario analysis, collaborative decommissioning efforts, and strengthening internal controls. It also highlights the importance of incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria and investing in technological research and development. Finally, the review emphasizes the need for future research on advanced decommissioning technologies, cross-industry comparisons, and enhanced financial instruments to address the growing complexity of ARO estimation in the upstream oil and gas industry.",2025-01-01,
"Extraction, Global Commodity Trade, and Urban Development in Zambia's Northwestern Province","<JATS1:p>Rita Kesselring provides a deep, open access ethnographic account of wildly uneven, deeply interconnected development trajectories of Solwezi, a rapidly growing copper mining town in Zambia, and Zug, an increasingly important urban hub for metal trading firms in Switzerland.In so doing, she provides a valuable and compelling case study of the unequal interdependencies, both financial and personal, that global capitalism creates between towns and cities in the Global North and Global South, all of which suggests new ways of fighting for more equitable relationships.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Through detailed storytelling, Kesselring explores the lives and routines of financiers in Switzerland as well as those of state officials, public office bearers, residents, architects, mine managers, and mine employees in Solwezi. From there, she follows Solwezi’s copper to harbors in Eastern and Southern Africa and beyond as it makes its way through warehousing, certification, customs clearance, shipping, financing, and trading. Highlighting the key actors in this value chain, Kesselring reveals not only the central role Switzerland plays in Southern Africa's mining industry, but also the central role that Southern Africa plays in Switzerland’s ever-growing status as a leading service commodity trading hub—this thanks primarily to the constant flow of wealth from Zambia to Switzerland.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>What emerges from this startlingly detailed portrait of inequitable interdependencies is a new path for a way forward. It is only through joint solidarity action between such vastly different but inherently connected places, Kesselring argues, that the world can arrive at more equitable North-South economic relationships.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>The ebook editions of this book are available open access under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licence on bloomsburycollections.com.</JATS1:p>",2025-01-01,
The Production Scale of the Coconut Sugar Commodities in Purbalingga Post Covid-19 Pandemic,"Coconut sugar has become a leading commodity in Purbalingga Regency. It is a substitute product for granulated sugar with a low glycaemic index, so it is a product with high demand. This research aims to analyse (1) coconut sugar productivity and (2) coconut sugar production scale. The analysis methods include multiple regression analysis using the Cobb-Douglas function approach to analyse productivity and return to scale analysis to analyse production scale (CRS, IRS, or DRS). The research results show that (1) capital and coconut sap production have a positive effect on coconut sugar production, while the number of labours has no effect and (2) the scale of coconut sugar production shows decreasing return to scale (DRS). These findings are proof that the Covid-19 pandemic is still having a big impact on their business. Therefore, the local government must take a major role in supporting this leading industry, such as providing technical and financial assistance along with intensive mentoring so that their businesses return to normal.",2025-01-01,
South Dakota State University Extension’s two-year beefSD program has high impact on beginning beef cattle producers,"Abstract The value of Extension programming is the generation of short (knowledge gain), medium (behavior change), and long (condition improvement) term outcomes or impact for clientele. Evaluating impact is a critical step in Extension programming. Effective evaluation can be used to measure outcomes, adapt and improve curricula of ongoing programs, and document public value gained from Extension funding. Although evaluation tools administered during or at the end of program activities can measure short-term outcomes, they cannot measure subsequent change in behavior and condition as a result of the program. South Dakota State University Extension has conducted a program entitled “beefSD” wherein cohorts of beginning beef cattle producers have been exposed to a two-year curriculum to increase their capacity to successfully manage their beef cattle enterprises. Five cohorts completed the program between 2010 and 2022. To measure the medium- and long-term impacts of this program, an online survey instrument was administered to the alumni of all five cohorts in Fall 2022. Twenty-two percent of alumni completed the survey. Survey results indicated that since completion of the program, most respondents expanded their beef cattle enterprises, implemented goals, financial, marketing, grazing, drought, and business plans, and became more profitable. The majority of respondents found high value from practices, tools, and concepts learned in beefSD that they incorporated into their enterprise management plans. Evaluation results indicated beefSD has positively impacted the beef cattle enterprises and lives of alumni, increasing the likelihood of their improved sustainability going forward. Further, this evaluation survey clearly demonstrated program impact, documenting public value from the program. Similar Extension programs could be developed for other regions or commodities, contributing comparable outcomes with program evaluation documenting further public value.",2025-01-01,
Financial Intelligence Units and Regulatory Technology to Combat Crypto Laundering,"Since digital payments increased in 2015, crypto laundering has become a significant threat. This study explores preventing crypto laundering through RegTech and FIU, using qualitative content analysis with NVivo 12. Legal documents from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (CFTR) served as secondary data sources. Crypto laundering mitigation includes KYC (Know Your Customer) and risk-based transaction monitoring. Customized RegTech solutions, like facial recognition technology, should complement blockchain analytics tools. The study found that government agencies issue suspicious transaction reports, while INTRAC, Indonesia’s financial institution unit, handles transaction monitoring and analysis using a “follow the money” methodology. This research contributes to forensic accounting knowledge and suggests policy-level actions for regulators, collaborating with technology specialists to combat crypto laundering.",2025-01-01,
The Methodological System for Developing Strategies for Financial Risk Management in the Context of Economic Globalization,"The article highlights the relevant issue of financial risk management in the context of economic globalization, which is accompanied by the integration of commodity, financial, informational, and labor markets. It is determined that globalization, on one hand, contributes to the growth of the efficiency of economic activity, while on the other hand, it intensifies the impact of uncertainties and creates new challenges for enterprises. A methodological system for developing financial risk management strategies is elaborated, encompassing stages such as risk identification, assessment, elaboration and implementation of efficient strategies, also their monitoring and review. Special attention is given to modern methods of risk identification and assessment, including SWOT analysis, PEST analysis, scenario analysis, VAR (Value at Risk), and stress testing. Emphasis is placed on the use of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, big data analysis, and cloud solutions, which significantly enhance the efficiency of risk management. Such instruments not only allow for the prompt identification of risks but also enable the forecasting of their impact, adapting strategies in accordance with changes in the internal and external environment. The proposed methodology takes into account the need for a system approach to risk management in the context of integrating enterprises into international economic processes. It is noted that efficient risk management is a guarantee of financial stability, the achievement of the organization’s strategic goals, and ensuring its competitiveness in the global market. Practical aspects of implementing the developed strategies in the activities of enterprises are considered separately. In particular, the importance of adaptive management is emphasized, which allows for a prompt response to changes in market conditions and minimizes losses from potential threats. The necessity of involving qualified personnel, creating efficient internal risk monitoring procedures, and integrating digital platforms for managing financial processes is underscored. The development and implementation of such measures ensure the increased resilience of organizations and contribute to their long-term competitiveness in the global environment. It is concluded that the developed methodology is aimed at creating conditions for minimizing potential threats, enhancing the adaptability of organizations, and optimizing the use of financial resources. The implementation of these strategies allows enterprises to achieve sustainable development even in the challenging conditions of globalization.",2025-01-01,
Suicide Prevention and Stress Management in Farmers: The Overlooked Role of Farm Finances,"Farmers experience high levels of stress, disproportionately high rates of depression and anxiety, and have suicide rates much higher than the general population. The authors and colleagues have examined the unique characteristics of farmers (high time demands, stigma around mental health needs, lack of mental health knowledge and ability to access services) and how suicide prevention and stress management interventions must be shaped to respect farmers’ needs. In this short communication we add to that work, realizing that one cannot address farmer stress and mental health without addressing the significant financial stressors they face. We begin building a knowledge base to inform future interventions by identifying the financial topics farmers would most like to learn about and which would thus decrease stress. We surveyed 310 farmers at several regional commodity conferences, asking them to rate a list of financial topics as “not helpful,” “a little helpful,” or “very helpful.” Analysis showed that the majority of farmers saw all topics as very helpful. The most frequently selected topics involved learning about programs that would help farmers post-disaster and programs to access government financial support. Interestingly, we found that for most of the financial topics, farmers who saw them as helpful were significantly younger than those who saw them as not helpful. We believe that addressing the financial information farmers need to reduce stress and promote success is crucial for provision of farmer mental health services. By integrating financial and stress management information in interventions, providers can promote vital mental health and well-being skills while also acknowledging and addressing the financial stresses farmers face. Tailoring programming to meet the needs of younger versus older farmers will be important to ensure programming meets varied farmers’ needs.",2025-01-01,
Intraregional Trade of the Asia-Pacific Under the Influence of Geopolitical Factors,"The article examines «deep» and «shallow» stages of international economic integration from the perspective of classical and modern researchers. As an example of «shallow» economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region, the author studied the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), as an example of «deep» integration – ASEAN (from a canonical point of view, the bloc is not such, however, it has some elements of financial integration). The aggravation of the geopolitical situation in the region (the «trade war» between China and the United States) affects the formation of trade blocs and the dynamics of foreign trade of the Asia-Pacific countries. Based on the econometric analysis of the Tinbergen model, the study showed that such geopolitical factors as territorial disputes have a negative impact on intraregional trade within ASEAN and RCEP both in the medium term (2014–2023) and in the long-term retrospective (1993–2023). At the same time, «trade wars» have a negative effect in the long term for both blocs (more pronounced for ASEAN) while a positive effect in the medium term for RCEP and negative effect for ASEAN. RCEP member states compete in the main commodity markets of the region and the world, thus the positive effect of trade wars in the medium term. For ASEAN, whose level of integration is deeper, the effects of trade wars are always negative. The multidirectional effect of trade wars on blocks with varying degrees of «depth» of integration processes requires further investigation with new objects and time periods",2025-01-01,
"Determinants of Intrinsic Value in Plantation Companies: An Analysis of Palm Oil Productivity, Firm Size, and Financial Performance on Indonesia Stock Exchange","The palm oil industry is a cornerstone of Indonesia’s economy, contributing significantly to GDP, exports, and employment. As the largest global palm oil producer, Indonesia supports a vast international market but faces challenges related to productivity and sustainability. This study investigates the influence of productivity, firm size, profitability, liquidity, and leverage on the intrinsic value of plantation companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2018–2022. Employing a quantitative methodology, panel data regression analysis was applied to a sample of 14 companies, selected through purposive sampling, representing a focused yet representative subset of the population. Intrinsic value was calculated using the Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) model under the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach. The findings reveal that firm size significantly enhances intrinsic value, indicating that larger firms benefit from economies of scale and better access to financing. However, productivity, profitability, liquidity, and leverage, while positively correlated, show statistically insignificant effects, suggesting that external factors such as global commodity price volatility and inefficiencies in financial management may play a role. This study underscores the critical role of firm size in driving intrinsic value while calling for further exploration of external factors impacting the palm oil sector. The results offer valuable insights for investors and policymakers in fostering financial performance and sustainable industry growth.",2024-12-31,
Analysis of Factors Affecting The Rupiah Exchange Rate Against The US Dollar,"This study aims to identify and analyze the main factors that influence the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar. The exchange rate is an important indicator that affects various sectors of the Indonesian economy, including international trade, inflation, and foreign investment. The method used is quantitative analysis with a multiple linear regression approach, using secondary data from Bank Indonesia, financial markets, and other related sources. The results of the study indicate that internal factors, such as inflation and BI interest rates, as well as external factors, such as the Fed interest rate and global commodity prices, play a significant role in determining exchange rate fluctuations. Higher inflation and an increase in the Fed interest rate tend to weaken the Rupiah, while an increase in the BI interest rate and foreign exchange reserves strengthen the Rupiah. In addition, global commodity prices also affect the stability of the Rupiah, especially through the impact on the trade balance. This study highlights the importance of appropriate monetary policy, foreign exchange market intervention, and foreign exchange reserve management in maintaining exchange rate stability. Understanding these factors is expected to help policymakers in dealing with global market dynamics and maintaining the stability of the Indonesian economy.",2024-12-31,
Credit Risk Analysis of Indonesia Nickel Industry from Banking Financing Perspective,"At the beginning of 2023, local banks observed increased demand for loan facilities to finance the purchase of new nickel transportation vessels, such as tugboats and barges. Loan repayments are expected to come from payments made by mining companies to shipping companies, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive credit risk analysis of Indonesia's nickel industry. Research found that market risk of nickel is highly influenced by China, the largest buyer, driven by demand from the stainless-steel industry and the rapidly expanding EV industry. Commodity risk analysis shows from 2018 to 2023, nickel prices exhibited annual volatility of 50% (0.50). A stress test indicated that if nickel prices dropped to USD 13,011.50/ton, companies would be unable to meet debt obligations. Financial risk analysis shows in year of 2022 both ANTM and INCO recorded good financial conditions with healthy profit margin and decent financial ratio including CR (above 1.0 times), DER (below 220%), and DSCR (above 1.0 times).",2024-12-31,
DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE ISLAMIC BOARDING SCHOOLS: ANALYSIS OF ONE PESANTREN ONE PRODUCT PROGRAM IN FOSTERING SELF-SUFFICIENCY,"The “One Pesantren One Product” (“OPOP”) program is a West Java provincial program that has become an initiative in building Islamic boarding school self-sufficiency through economic empowerment by assisting Islamic boarding schools in choosing marketable commodities, providing training, and mentoring. This study aims to analyze the OPOP program's effectiveness in fostering self-sufficiency as a form of sustainable development in Tasikmalaya. Using a qualitative approach that includes case studies and in-depth analysis, this research identifies the significance of the realization of the OPOP program on the self-sufficiency of Islamic boarding schools in Tasikmalaya who recipients of OPOP stimulant funds are. The research examines how the program has facilitated improvements in the economic aspects of Islamic boarding school self-sufficiency. The results show that the OPOP program is able to encourage the financial independence of the OPOP recipient pesantren in the scale-up category by optimizing business productivity, expansion, and networking of pesantren product marketing, which leads to an increase in pesantren income. This explains that the OPOP program can support the successful development of sustainable Islamic boarding schools, especially in financial independence.",2024-12-31,

Assessing the Sustainability of Russian Iron and Steel Companies Amid a Structural Crisis,"In the present paper the authors developed and tested the sustainability index of Russian iron and steel companies against the background of a structural crisis caused by the sanctions of 2022. Six companies with public reporting, including Nornickel and United Company RUSAL, were analyzed. The index comprises financial sustainability (Altman’s Z-score), operation flexibility, strategic planning horizon, economic value added (EVA), as well as environmental and social aspects. It was established that companies that actively adapt such strategies as market and commodity diversification, supply chain management and environmental standard integration exhibit stronger sustainability. For example, Nornickel managed toredirect export from Europe to Asia, maintaining its financial stability despite a reduction in EBITDA by 17%. When RUSAL came up against supply chain disruption and an increase in costs, it recouped a part of losses by expanding in Asian markets and domestic operations. Practical recommendations based on the research comprise extending the planning horizon, reducing reliance on a single product or region and reinforcing the environmental and social sustainability. These conclusions confirm the hypothesis that companies that have gained experience in crisis management overcome new challenges with greater success.",2024-12-31,
Study of Volatility Spillover from Crude Oil Futures to Grain Futures Across Multiple Cycles Based on the EEMD-BEKK-GARCH Model,"Against the backdrop of increasing financialization of grain markets, the cross-cycle and cross-market contagion among commodities has been intensifying. To investigate the risk spillover among commodities across different cycles, this study selected UK WTI crude oil and soybean, corn, and wheat futures prices from the Chicago Board of Trade as research subjects. Using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the original sequences were decomposed into sub-sequences of different frequencies. Based on these frequency characteristics, long-term, medium-term, and short-term fluctuations were constructed. The BEKK-GARCH model was then applied to explore the volatility spillover across markets under different cycles. The results indicate that in terms of pricing mechanisms, crude oil futures dominate the price fluctuations of grain futures. In terms of risk spillover across different cycles, there is a bidirectional risk spillover effect between crude oil and grain futures in short-term and medium-term fluctuations, while in long-term fluctuations, there is only a unidirectional transmission from crude oil futures to grain futures. Based on the research findings, this paper proposes relevant policy recommendations, aiming to provide government regulatory authorities and futures investors with policy guidance and a theoretical foundation across different cycles.",2024-12-30,
Livelihood Assets and Households Vulnerability toward Food Commodity Price: An Evidence from Post-Disaster Community in Banda Aceh,"The recovery process following the 2004 mega-disaster and the Covid-19 pandemic have significant implications for the dynamics of change and community resilience in Banda Aceh. A resilient community is characterized by the ability to adapt to various threat risks, including volatile market conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate livelihood assets in Banda Aceh and the influence on households vulnerability to fluctuation in the market price of food commodity. To achieve this objective, the study used a questionnaire survey method with 560 household heads as the unit of analysis spread across 28 villages in Banda Aceh. Furthermore, data were analyzed using a descriptive method to calculate livelihood assets and vulnerability index, along with multiple linear regression to analyze the effect of livelihood capital on vulnerability. The results showed that the condition of human and financial capital was still weak compared to social and physical capital. Households also had a high level of vulnerability to fluctuation in food prices. Statistically, human, financial, and social capital had a significant effect on households vulnerability. This study showed the importance of fostering both human and financial capital at the households level to improvequality of life and economic resilience. There were also needs for initiatives to improve social networks as a means of adapting to unexpected events.",2024-12-30,

The Resilience Effort of Indonesian Tea Smallholder Plantation by Intercropping and Agroforestry Tea Farming System,"Indonesia’s tea industry heavily relies on smallholder plantations, which contribute 50% of the national tea plantation area and 40% of production. However, smallholder tea farmers face numerous challenges, including declining soil fertility, low tea process, and the impacts of climate change among them are drought and the outbreak of pests and diseases, which threaten their productivity and sustainability. Intercropping and agroforestry systems have emerged as viable strategies to enhance resilience by diversifying income sources, improving ecological sustainability and adapting to changing climatic conditions. This is happening even as many other tea farmers are choosing to convert their tea crops to other commodities considered more profitable. This study explores the implementation, benefits, and challenges of intercropping and agroforestry systems in Indonesia smallholder tea plantations. The findings reveal that these systems not only enhance biodiversity and soil health but also align with global sustainability goals such as the SDGs by fostering economic stability and environmental conservation. The intercropping and agroforestry systems involve the cultivation of vegetables, fruits, spices, and timber plants in various patterns. However, adoption remains limited to due to barriers such as inadequate resources, knowledge, and policy support. The paper concludes with recommendations to promote these practices, including policy reforms, capacity -building programs, financial incentives, and market development, to ensure a sustainable and inclusive tea agribusiness ecosystem for smallholders.",2024-12-30,
TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE SOWING AREAS STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION OF AN AGRICULTURAL ENTERPRISE,"This work aims to present the results of the development and testing of a model for optimizing the structure of sown areas based on the criterion of maximizing the total gross profit from the production and sale of commodity crop products. The model allows us to consider changes in market, technological, and other production factors through various technological maps for growing different crops, as well as recalculate planned costs, taking into account the costs incurred for work in progress. This allows you to consider the rapid changes in the external and internal environment that agricultural enterprises in Ukraine face today. The work describes the objective function, defines the limitations, and calculates the planned gross profit for the existing structure of sown areas in 2023. It searches for the optimal solution for the structure of sown areas for the Bila Tserkva Research and Breeding Station, investigates the prospects and possibilities of considering technological changes in plant production when using the optimization model, and complies with resource use standards. Each cropʼs production and sale costs are calculated for a separate cost item. Other restrictions, such as crop rotation, impact on soil condition and quality, availability of equipment, and timing of technological operations related to technological factors of production, were taken into account when forming restrictions on the maximum or minimum share of a separate crop or group of crops in the total sown area of the Bila Tserkva Research and Breeding Station. The implementation of the optimal solution regarding the structure of sown areas will allow an increase in the gross profit of the Bila Tserkva Research and Breeding Station from the sale of commercial crops included in the optimization model by UAH 15.47 million in 2024 (or by 79 %). At the same time, the profitability of production will increase from 28.8 % to 36.6 %. This indicates the ability of agricultural enterprises to increase their profitability and financial stability in wartime conditions. The proposed model was developed for the enterprise under study, but after adaptation, it can be used by other agricultural enterprises to evaluate similar solutions.",2024-12-28,
Comovement between the Stock Markets and Commodity Market,"The study extends the literature by investigating the comovement between the stock markets and commodity market of developed and emerging countries. Developed countries are represented by G7 countries while the emerging countries are represented by BRICS countries. Further, for the commodity market, the Global S&amp;P GSCI commodity index is used that comprised of all major global commodities. The daily log returns of all the markets are used for analysis. Further, the wavelet coherence model is used to investigate the comovement between the stock markets and commodity market. The results show that the comovement between the stock markets of all the countries is increases over time particularly at the larger frequency scales. The comovement is higher during the crisis periods like the global financial crisis and COVID-19.

Diversifying Asset Management in Legacy Planning: A Comparative Analysis of Alternative and Traditional Assets for Long-Term Financial Well-Being,"Effective legacy planning necessitates a comprehensive approach to asset management, ensuring long-term financial well-being for future generations. This study investigates the role of diversification in legacy planning by conducting a comparative analysis of alternative and traditional assets.This study also explores the significance of diversification in asset management within the context of legacy planning, focusing on a comparative analysis of alternative and traditional assets to enhance long-term financial well-being. As individuals seek to secure their financial legacy, understanding the roles that different asset classes play becomes crucial. Traditional assets, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, have long been the cornerstone of investment strategies. However, alternative assets—such as real estate, private equity, and commodities—are gaining traction due to their potential for higher returns and lower correlation with traditional markets.This research employs a quantitative approach to evaluate the performance, risk-adjusted returns, and diversification benefits of both asset categories. By analyzing historical data and current trends, the study aims to provide insights into how a balanced approach that includes both alternative and traditional assets can optimize financial outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating alternative assets into legacy planning strategies, highlighting their potential to mitigate risks and enhance overall portfolio performance. Ultimately, this study serves as a guide for individuals and advisors seeking to construct resilient investment strategies that align with long-term financial goals and legacy aspirations.",2024-12-28,
Do companies benefit from publishing sustainability-integrated reports? Evidence from the United Arab Emirates,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent of narrative disclosure in the sustainability-integrated reports of listed companies in the UAE and its effect of firm’ performances. In 2020, The Securities and Commodities Authority issued a circular requiring all public joint stock companies listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) or the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) to publish a sustainability report as part of their set of Integrated Reports. Design/methodology/approach Using all publicly available sustainability integrated reports of listed companies in DFM and ADX over the period 2018–2022, we first gather the report’s content by compiling a list of words using a computational linguistic technique that aims to identify specific characteristics of sustainability reports. Then, we use a GLS model to study the effect of the sustainability reporting on firm financial performance and risk. Findings The paper findings shows the level of sustainability disclosure of observed firms is noticeable. Besides, sustainability reporting has a significant effect on firm’s operational performance (ROA), financial performance (ROE) and market performance (Tobin’s Q). Nevertheless; it does not affect the financial risk. Research limitations/implications Our study makes many contributions to the literature on corporate reporting. First, our analysis complements research that largely focuses on the financial disclosures in corporate reports by examining the sustainability-specific information and providing a full review of sustainability narratives. Second, by examining the effect of sustainability reports on shareholders' wealth, this article contributes to the current knowledge of sustainability reporting. Practical implications Our research offers several practical implications to policymakers, management, shareholders in different ways. The outcomes of this study helps policymakers to assess the effect of the Securities and Commodities Authority circular on the extent of sustainability related information disclosed in the integrated-report. It also helps the government to understand the level of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure per sectors. Besides, this research findings give insight to managers to understand the effect of ESG disclosed information in the sustainability integrated report on firm financial and market performances. In addition, the paper findings assure shareholders of the positive impact on sustainability integrated-report on firm performance. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no research has yet looked at the narratives of sustainability reports in the UAE context taking into account the different important aspects of these reports and its impact on firm performance and risk.",2024-12-27,

The purpose of the article is to develop theoretical and practical provisions of the process of introducing digital technologies into exchange trading, as well as to substantiate the necessary measures to improve the institutional structure of the exchange market. Materials and methods. A number of methodological approaches and local methods were used in the work (general scientific: description, analysis, classification, study of scientific literature, systematization and generalization of theoretical material on this topic; specific scientific: document analysis; economic methods – analysis of the dynamics of economic indicators; methods of horizontal and vertical analysis, graphical and tabular analysis). Research results. In the context of geopolitical tension and limited access to international financial resources, the development of exchange trading based on the introduction of digital technologies is of particular importance. Russian exchange trading, following global trends, is transforming under the influence of digital technologies and the changing economic situation. High volatility associated with dependence on commodity markets and geopolitics is combined with the active introduction of online platforms and algorithmic trading, which attracts private investors to the market. The expansion of new digital institutions in the financial market ensures a significant increase in its transparency, as well as a significant reduction in the volume of transaction costs. Discussion and conclusion. The use of various information technology mechanisms in the process of exchange trading determines the expansion of investment opportunities for economic entities, which contributes to increasing the economic security of the country. At the same time, there is a need for diversification, reducing the role of state-owned companies, improving the protection of investor rights and adapting regulation to digital realities and cyber threats. Such a transformation is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of Russian exchange trading.",2024-12-27,
RESOURCE POTENTIAL OF AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EFFECTIVE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT,"The resource potential of agricultural organizations is a complex system that combines natural, land, material, technical, and labor resources in an optimal ratio in order to increase the efficiency of agricultural production, which determines the competitive advantages of organizations in the agro-food market. The assessment of the competitive capabilities of agricultural organizations in Ulyanovsk region depending on the availability of resources was carried out on the basis of calculations of interrelated indicators for two blocks: operational (characterizes the components of the resource potential) and investment (reflects the conditions for the formation and use of the resource potential). The analysis of the calculated data on the sum of places using the visualization tool “box-and-whisker plot” allows us to note the increase in the importance of the operating unit in 2022 compared to 2017. The highest financial results were achieved by agricultural organizations, which are characterized by a more uniform formation of revenue from commodity resources of crop and livestock production, are better provided with fixed and working capital, which gives them competitive advantages in the food market. Cluster analysis by visualizing the obtained results obtained using self-organizing Kohonen maps on the analytical platform Deductor made it possible to identify four clusters based on a set of indicators characterizing the composition and efficiency of using resource potential.

INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION INNOVATIVE REPRODUCTION IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY,"The institutional determinants of ensuring the expanded reproduction of the national economy on an innovative basis are substantiated. It is established that innovative reproduction is determined by the modern model and ontological principles of formation of the innovation process, which acts as an organizational basis for promoting a scientific product to a commodity producer and is focused on meeting the needs of consumers of innovations, as well as on developing own innovations that allow obtaining a long-term economic effect and are focused on the long-term nature of innovative development. It is stated that in order to modernize the innovation process at all stages of its organization, it is necessary to introduce elements of institutional design to form transitional forms of process implementation and transform them into more modern forms. It is proved that the organization of the production process based on the development of own innovations provides a spiral dynamics of reproduction, which allows obtaining in a new production cycle modernized or fundamentally new innovations that improve production, contribute to an increase in the output of innovative goods and obtaining a commercial effect in the form of additional monetary income. It is determined that the innovative type of reproduction is based on a system of regulated formal norms that direct economic entities to participate in the process of production, distribution and consumption of an innovative product. The innovative dynamics is realized through the institutions formed at each level of the hierarchy with the appropriate direction and coordination of the norms of innovative behavior of economic entities. It is argued that the dynamics of innovative transformations, the formation of an organizational model of the innovation process and the nature of extended reproduction are influenced by exogenous and endogenous factors. The endogenous factors of influence of innovative reproduction (personnel, financial, information support, equipment and technologies, organization of production) are systematized. It is substantiated that exogenous influence on innovative reproduction is exerted by factors formed by basic economic institutions, formal norms and infrastructure provision.",2024-12-26,

Operant demand and public health,"The field of ""behavioral economics"" was launched by two Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior articles from Hursh in the 1980s (Hursh, 1980, 1984). Hursh's behavioral economics was of the operant variety, focusing on contingencies and reinforcer constraints as influences on operant response patterns. This operant perspective differed dramatically from the coincidentally coinciding emergence of the cognitive variety of behavioral economics that focused on prospect theory and cognitive biases. The divergence in theory persists today, with operant behavioral economics existing as a separate scholarly enterprise from cognitive behavioral economics (Costa et al., 2019; Reed, Niileksela, et al., 2013). For the remainder of this article, any reference to ""behavioral economics"" refers to the operant variety unless otherwise stated. Behavioral economics primarily comprises two major emphases: reward discounting and operant demand. However, this special issue focuses specifically on operant demand. Operant demand is the study of reinforcer consumption amidst increasing constraints per the law of demand (Samuelson, 1937)—an idea translated from microeconomic principles. In the operant perspective, behavior is exchanged for reinforcer delivery, whereby the unit price of a reinforcer can be understood as the amount of behavior needing to be expended for one reinforcer unit (Hursh et al., 1988). That is, the unit price is a ratio of behavior to reinforcer units, which is typically conceptualized as the primary independent variable in demand analyses. As per the law of demand, reinforcer consumption decreases as the unit price increases, most often in a nonlinear (e.g., hyperbolic-like or exponential) function. Operant demand is a multifaceted construct that provides several quantitative measures of relative reinforcer efficacy from demand curve analyses. Demand curves are generated by plotting consumption as a function of unit price, typically using a nonlinear mathematical function (Gilroy et al., 2021; Hursh & Silberberg, 2008; Koffarnus et al., 2022; Newman & Ferrario, 2020). These curves are often depicted and analyzed in log–log space to permit better clarity and interpretation in proportional relations of consumption and unit price. Demand curves yield several facets of reinforcer efficacy that are of interest to behavioral economists. First, demand intensity refers to the number of reinforcers consumed at no or minimal price. Second, demand elasticity refers to the relative change in consumption associated with each relative change in unit price. When plotted in log–log space, elasticity equates to the point slope of the curve. Elasticity is most often discussed in terms of α (i.e., alpha), which is a fitted parameter describing the rate of change in elasticity across a demand curve (Gilroy et al., 2020; Hursh and Silberberg, 2008). Third, Pmax (i.e., maximum price) is the price at which elasticity is exactly −1.00, meaning that a one-unit increase in unit price is met with precisely one unit decrease in consumption (Gilroy et al., 2019); this is the point of unit elasticity, where demand shifts from inelastic (i.e., less than one unit decrease in consumption with each unit increase in unit price) to elastic (i.e., greater than one unit decrease in consumption with each unit increase in unit price). Fourth, the work function is plotted as the total number of responses emitted as a function of unit price, where output is equal to quantity consumed multiplied by unit price. The point of maximum output on the work function is called Omax and occurs at Pmax. The work function is a useful companion to demand because it captures the degree to which a reinforcer dominates the behavioral output of the organism. Fifth, essential value can be calculated as a singular metric of response persistence amidst the increases in unit price across the demand curve, incorporating several facets of demand in its calculation (Gilroy, 2023). Finally, some researchers also examine break point, a traditional measure of reinforcer efficacy from progressive-ratio studies that simply quantifies the price at which reinforcer consumption ceases. The aforementioned quantitative facets of demand lend themselves well to addressing issues of social importance for two reasons. First, demand analyses are mathematically precise and can describe and predict relations of reinforcer prices to consummatory patterns. These robust and objective analyses can serve as a baseline measure of demand by which comparisons can be made when an independent variable is introduced and a new demand curve is rendered. Second, policy makers enjoy the mathematical language of demand because its metrics are readily translatable to meaningful conversations. Demand inherently addresses the influence of cost, which is a standard lever for changing consumer behavior—for example, costs can be levied through taxation/tariffs or manipulating the response burden to promote or thwart consumption. Understanding the precise influence of consumer behavior when costs are manipulated provides potent information to decision makers who are considering mechanisms to influence behavior. For these reasons, it is unsurprising that demand has become a powerful tool in behavioral public policy pursuits (Hursh, 1991; Hursh & Roma, 2013; Reed, Gelino, et al., 2022; Reed, Strickland, et al., 2022; Roma et al., 2017). The influence of operant demand on public health was first realized during the emergence of the cocaine crisis in the 1980s and 1990s. As the concept of operant demand became formalized, the United States was reeling from the cocaine epidemic and in desperate need of novel solutions. Hursh's conceptualization of leveraging demand to inform drug policy (Hursh, 1991) materialized around the same time that behavioral economists such as Warren Bickel and Steve Higgins were beginning to translate behavioral economic approaches from the nonhuman literature to understanding human drug self-administration (Bickel et al., 1990, 1993). This new operant demand enterprise proved incredibly helpful in understanding drug use, blazing a trail for further translation to various public health concerns. Since the 1990s work in drug self-administration, operant demand has been successfully applied to understanding a host of public health concerns, such as alcohol use (Kaplan, Foster, et al., 2018; Morris et al., 2017; Murphy & MacKillop, 2006), tobacco use (Jacobs & Bickel, 1999; MacKillop et al., 2008; Reed et al., 2020), illicit drugs (Berry et al., 2023; Greenwald & Hursh, 2006; Strickland, Campbell, et al., 2020), cannabis use (Aston et al., 2017, 2023; Collins et al., 2014), healthy eating (Epstein, Paluch, et al., 2018; Epstein, Stein, et al., 2018; Sze et al., 2017), ultraviolet indoor tanning (Becirevic, Reed, & Amlung, 2017; Becirevic, Reed, Amlung, Murphy, et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2016), medication uptake (Hursh et al., 2020; Jarmolowicz et al., 2020; Strickland et al., 2023), risky sexual activities (Gebru et al., 2024; Harsin et al., 2021; Strickland, Marks, et al., 2020), texting and driving (Hayashi, Foreman, et al., 2019; Hayashi, Friedel, et al., 2019), and environmental policies (Gelino et al., 2023; Kaplan, Gelino, et al., 2018; Reed, Partington, et al., 2013), to name a few. Beyond describing demand for socially important health behaviors, demand studies have also simulated potential public health policies and interventions to model potential consumer effects in topics such as pandemic mitigation strategies (Strickland, Reed, Hursh, et al., 2022), safe late-night transportation options (Gelino et al., 2024), excise taxation (Grace et al., 2015), happy hour drinking policies (Kaplan & Reed, 2018), changes in menthol regulations in smoking (O'Connor et al., 2012), and legalization of recreational drug use (Amlung et al., 2019). These simulated tasks have also shown promising predictive validity, wherein studies that assessed actual health choices following the simulated methods documented convergence between what participants said they would do and ultimately did (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2021; Strickland, Reed, Dayton, et al., 2022). The breadth of operant demand across public health is visualized in Figure 1 (interactive version available at https://tinyurl.com/OperantDemandVOS) as a bibliometric network plot using VosViewer (van Eck & Waltman, 2010). Specifically, we searched for all scholarly work on lens.org with all of the following terms: ""operant,"" ""behavioral economics,"" and ""demand."" The search returned 201 articles, which we then analyzed regarding source citations (i.e., the degree to which journals publishing those 201 papers cite one another). Six clusters emerged, color-coded in Figure 1. The red cluster (anchored by The Behavior Analyst) appears to comprise broad applications of behavior analysis, with emphases on applied psychology (e.g., Aids and Behavior, Behavior and Social Issues). The blue cluster (anchored by the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior) appears to represent translational demonstrations from the experimental analysis of behavior (e.g., Behavioural Processes, Current Addiction Reports). The purple cluster (anchored by Psychopharmacology) appears to comprise psychobiology and behavioral pharmacology applications (e.g., Drug and Alcohol Dependence, Tobacco Regulatory Science). The green cluster (anchored by The Psychological Record) represents behavior analytic pursuits (e.g., Behavior Analysis in Practice, Animal Learning & Behavior). Finally, the yellow cluster (anchored by Neuropsychopharmacology) appears to represent neuroscience and psychiatric extensions of demand (e.g., Behavioural Pharmacology, Translational Psychiatry). The size of the circles associated with each journal represents the relative number of articles from that journal. Connecting lines demonstrate citations between journals. Beyond showing the breadth of publication outlets and the clusters of journal topics, the network plot also visualizes the interconnectedness of operant demand research—work in one domain affects work in others. The influence of operant demand on public health appears to be well documented (Bickel et al., 2016). The growth in this topic area prompted the call for articles for this special issue.1 Our goal with this special issue was to show novel applications of operant demand to public health and present novel research approaches that will further spark translational endeavors. This special issue features six articles, which we see as addressing three research domains: (1) reward valuation and policy-relevant behavior, (2) public health interventions, and (3) expansion into novel public policy domains. Understanding the dynamics of healthy behaviors through operant demand is critical for designing effective public policies for prevention and intervention strategies (Reed, Gelino, et al., 2022). Martínez-Herrada and colleagues' article, ""Distribution of Schedule-Induced Behaviors Depends on the Essential Value of the Reinforcer,"" provides an excellent preclinical study that demonstrates the translational utility of operant demand for potential public health applications. The inclusion of a preclinical study is important for this special issue, given recent discussion of demand as a unifying language between human and nonhuman models of health behavior. Specifically, Martínez-Herrada and colleagues examined the development of schedule-induced drinking (SID) in rats under fixed-time reinforcement schedules. The study demonstrates how reinforcer preference—operationalized through essential value derived from demand curves—affects the rate and competition of adjunctive behaviors like SID. In this study, rats receiving their least preferred food pellets demonstrated higher rates of drinking than those receiving their most preferred pellets, particularly under shorter interfood intervals. These findings suggest that preferred reinforcers, even when equally nutritious, encourage terminal behaviors such as magazine entries, competing with adjunctive behaviors like SID. The implications of this research extend beyond basic behavioral processes. By showing how the essential value of reinforcers influences behavior, the study provides a basis for public policy directed at modifying food preferences to promote healthier behaviors. For example, policies that improve the taste and availability of nutritious foods could reduce demand for less healthy options, aligning with broader goals to address obesity and other health concerns. The preclinical approach affords a higher degree of internal validity to isolate the controlling variables—this level of research provides an excellent springboard for further translation to human affairs. Moving to human research, Murphy and colleagues' article, ""Reward Deprivation and Alcohol Demand in Emerging Adults,"" demonstrates how reward deprivation influences alcohol demand among young adults. Their study used alcohol purchase tasks to examine how indices of deprivation (e.g., socioeconomic stress and environmental enrichment) modulate alcohol's reinforcing value. These findings suggest that greater reward deprivation is associated with increased demand for alcohol, as evidenced by higher demand intensity and reduced price sensitivity. These results align with theories suggesting that limited access to substance-free rewards enhances the reinforcing value of addictive substances. By elucidating these dynamics, Murphy and colleagues' article provides actionable insights for policy makers, emphasizing the need to create environments rich in substance-free alternatives to mitigate addiction risks (see Witkiewitz & Tucker, 2024). Finally, Miller and colleagues' article, ""Exploring the Suitability of Cannabis Use with Next-Day Responsibilities: A Behavioral Economic and Qualitative Study,"" demonstrates context influences on cannabis demand using a modified marijuana purchase task. Participants completed hypothetical scenarios involving cannabis consumption under varying next-day responsibility conditions, such as work, caregiving, or leisure. The results indicated significant reductions in cannabis demand when participants anticipated responsibilities requiring focus or care, such as job interviews or childcare. Interestingly, participants' perceptions of cannabis suitability—using qualitative thematic analyses—were closely linked to demand indices, with higher perceived compatibility leading to increased consumption. This study highlights the subtle role of individual perceptions and contextual factors in shaping substance use decisions, offering important implications for public health campaigns and workplace policies. We applaud the authors' use of qualitative methods to help inform interpretations of quantitative measures and view this article as an excellent exemplar in expanding our methodology to best answer behavioral economic questions. As discussed in the introduction of this editorial, public health is one of the most influential domains for operant demand methodologies, as these tools can reveal the contingencies driving critical health behaviors (Reed, Strickland, et al., 2022). Importantly, the ability to test potential public policy interventions to advance health is a unique advantage of behavioral economic methods (see Roma et al., 2017). Edgemon and colleagues' article, ""Comparing and Intervening on Behavioral Demand for Snack Foods Among Justice-Involved Adolescents: A Preliminary Translational Analysis,"" demonstrates how behavioral economic frameworks can address health disparities in vulnerable populations. Their study used a commodity purchase task to assess demand for high- and low-energy-density snack foods among adolescents in juvenile residential treatment facilities. The researchers observed that high-energy-density foods exhibited greater reinforcing value than healthier options, highlighting the role of environmental factors in shaping food preferences. Importantly, a nutritional intervention successfully shifted demand, reducing preferences for unhealthy options. These findings demonstrate how operant demand methods can inform interventions that are directed at reducing obesity and improving long-term health outcomes, particularly in marginalized populations. The adaptability of hypothetical purchase tasks allows researchers to explore diverse and novel applications, rendering these approaches highly advantageous when exploring new domains. Decades of purchase task works have resulted in gold-standard approaches to measuring demand (e.g., Roma et al., 2016), making it easier for researchers to extend these methods to new topics while remaining conceptually systematic and anchored to the extant literature. This section includes articles that extend operant demand methodologies to innovative policy-relevant areas. Day-Watkins and colleagues' article, ""Optimizing Variables for Contingency Management Among Infant Caregivers Using a Simulated Purchase Task,"" investigates caregiver decision making regarding safe infant sleep environments. This study translated a willingness-to-accept approach to a demand framework to explore how financial incentives influence adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. The results demonstrated that larger incentives increased adherence rates, underscoring the potential of contingency management strategies to promote infant safety. An important finding, however, was that these effects were modulated by the caregivers' impressions of the intervention's social validity. This research provides a novel application of demand analyses to maternal and child health. Battaglia and colleagues' article, ""Assessing Differential Personal Information Value with Social Discounting and Hypothetical Payment Tasks with University Students,"" explores the valuation of personal information in cybersecurity contexts. To date, behavioral economic pursuits have not been translated cybersecurity, despite the critical social need for such science. Using hypothetical purchase tasks, the study assessed how individuals value different types of personal information, such as financial or health data, under various pricing conditions. Findings revealed significant differences in perceived value across data types, with financial information commanding the highest demand. These insights can inform policies that are directed at enhancing cybersecurity and protecting consumer privacy. Behavioral science has a rich history of targeting policy as an efficient and effective means of behavior change in public health. Public policy is particularly attractive to behavior analytic pursuits given its far-reaching influence and emphasis on environmental contexts to spur behavior (see Fawcett et al., 1988). Behavioral economics has emerged as a unique mechanism by which to address public health via behavioral science given its robust methods and policy-relevant measures (Bickel et al., 2016; Hursh & Roma, 2013; Reed, Strickland, et al., 2022). This special issue was published in recognition of operant demand's promise and potential to influence public health and policy. The articles in this special issue illustrate the versatility of operant demand methodologies in addressing a wide array of societal challenges. From improving health behaviors to understanding substance use dynamics and exploring novel policy domains, these studies demonstrate the profound potential of behavioral economics to inform public health policy. This collection highlights the power of operant demand frameworks to drive meaningful societal change across three themes: (1) reward valuation and policy-relevant behavior, (2) public health interventions, and (3) expansion into novel public policy domains. As operant demand research continues to evolve, its applications will likely expand further, offering new opportunities to address emerging challenges in public health, technology, and beyond. The contributions in this issue underscore the critical role of behavioral economics in shaping evidence-based interventions and policies. All authors contributed equally to this article.

How has the relationship between major financial markets changed during the Russia–Ukraine conflict?,"Geopolitics events have a significant impact on financial markets in the process of global economic integration and financial liberalization. Focusing on the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict, this paper utilizes the TVP-VAR network connectedness approach to investigate its specific impacts on the connectedness of major global financial markets. It examines the dynamic evolution of high-frequency and low-frequency shocks on market correlations during the pre-conflict, initial, and stalemate stages, revealing the changes in risk transmission paths. Findings show that the conflict led to increased market interconnectedness. Low-frequency became a major part of the total spillover, signaling long-term structural changes. The stock and foreign exchange market initially responded swiftly, serving as starting points for risk diffusion. The commodity market has been risk receivers throughout the conflict period. Intra-market and cross-market linkages have also changed. The German stock market was the main source of risk spillovers in the conflict, influencing international market linkages. In the global financial market network, several stock markets were the primary risk transmitters in the early stage of the conflict, while foreign exchange markets took on this role during the stalemate period. In addition, gold continues to play a safe-haven role. Furthermore, the TVP-VAR model is used to quantitatively assess the extent of the impact of the conflict on the spillover effects of major global financial markets at different time points and lags. Based on these findings, this paper constructs diversified portfolios and proposes a series of targeted risk management recommendations, which provide a theoretical basis for future policy formulation under similar crises.",2024-12-26,
The Causes and Impacts of the Depreciation of the Japanese Yen,"This paper analyzes the causes of the yens depreciation since the COVID-19 pandemic and examines its potential impacts on both the Japanese domestic economy and the international landscape. In the post-pandemic era, global productivity has significantly declined, leading to rising prices and ushering in an era of low growth, high inflation, and elevated interest rates. This has presented unprecedented challenges to the development of national economies. The paper first highlights Japans critical economic position in the post-pandemic context and then analyzes the causes of the yens depreciation from three perspectives: the divergence in U.S. and Japanese monetary policies, global economic conditions, and Japans domestic economic environment. Finally, the paper discusses the effects of the yens depreciation, noting that while it has contributed to an increase in net exports and an improvement in deflationary pressures, the persistent rise in domestic living costs, driven by higher commodity prices, remains a central challenge to Japans long-term economic growth. In conclusion, the depreciation of the yen amid global financial volatility highlights the intricate interplay between domestic economic policies and international financial markets. Japans experience underscores the complexities faced by advanced economies in a highly interconnected global economy, where shifts in major currencies and monetary policies can have far-reaching implications for economic stability and growth.",2024-12-26,
"A Study on the Dynamic Conditional Correlation Between International Oil, Gold, and Chinas Stock Markets","In the context of globalization, Chinas stock market (CSM) is increasingly impacted by the risks in international financial markets, especially the two important commodities, oil and gold. This article started from the perspective of stock market styles and used the model to explore the dynamic conditional correlation between international oil, gold markets, and CSM. The study found a positive mean dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) between the international oil market and CSM, which is heterogeneous for different market styles. On average, Oil price shocks are more correlated with large-cap, value, and dividend stocks. After further dividing the sample interval, the study found that during the occurrence of external shocks, the DCC between assets generally increases. As for gold, the research also found a positive mean DCC between the international gold market and CSM, which expands when external shocks occur as well, failing to reflect its hedging properties. The research not only enriches the understanding of the linkage mechanism among financial markets but also provides an empirical basis for investors to formulate more precise risk management and investment strategies in the changing international market environment.",2024-12-26,
Enhancing Performance for Fama-French Model Based on New Factors: Evidence from Multiple Industries,"As a matter of fact, in the current complex and volatile financial markets, the traditional Fama-French five-factor model shows some limitations in explaining stock returns. With this in mind, this study introduces new technical indicators (e.g., MACD, RSI, and CCI), to improve the model's performance as well as analyze the performance of the technology, energy, healthcare, financial, construction, and commodities sectors. To be specific, this research uses data collection, model construction, hypothesis testing, and statistical analysis to improve the model's explanatory power and predictive accuracy. According to the analysis, the finding proves the new factors' effectiveness and provides investors with a more accurate asset pricing tool. The research in this paper emphasizes the importance of innovation and improvement of traditional asset pricing models in the changing financial market environment. At the same time, it discusses the implications of the findings for investment strategies and market efficiency and suggests possible directions for future research.",2024-12-26,
Rethinking sanctions: Exploring resistance and internal dynamics through a target‐centred lens,"Over the past few decades, sanctions have become a key foreign policy tool in international politics. Sanctions involve states or international organisations pressuring target states to make political changes by restricting economic interactions, including trade, investment, and finance (Jones, 2015). The United States (US) has been the most frequent user of sanctions (Hufbauer et al., 1990), increasingly employing them to promote its foreign policy objectives by inflicting economic damage. US-led sanctions increased by 933%, rising from 912 in the year 2000 to 9421 by 2021, targeting 25 different countries (US Treasury, 2021). As sanctions became used against other countries extensively, literature around sanctions focuses on whether and when sanctions work or not. Such questions aim to address efficiency and/or deficiency of sanctions on target countries from a sender-centred lens, drawing from Eurocentric and Atlantic-centric discourses, which seeks to ameliorate the grand theory of how to improve the effectiveness of sanctions. Therefore, in return, this question results in the exclusion of potential dynamics within a target state to resist sanctions. To move beyond the Eurocentric, Atlantic-centric, sender-focused perspective that has long dominated discussions on sanctions, it is crucial to reframe the central question from whether and when sanctions work to why they succeed or fail. This shift involves adopting a target-centred lens, where the attention is placed on the behaviour, resilience, and strategies of the sanctioned country or countries rather than exclusively on the sanctioning power. By assessing how the targeted states adapt, resist, or comply with sanctions, scholars can gain deeper insights into the internal dynamics, socio-political structures, and economic capacities that affect the efficiency of sanctions. Shifting the prominence in this way challenges existing frameworks and encourages a re-assessment of extensively accepted theories and assumptions. It prompts a reconsideration of key concepts such as compliance, defiance, and resistance, thereby opening new avenues for understanding the complex and often unpredictable consequences of sanctions policies. This approach also highlights the agency of the sanctioned states, which has often been overlooked in conventional evaluations, and calls for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between external pressure and internal response. To examine this approach, I have selected two books that implicitly address the why by examining the mechanisms of resistance. The books are titled, How Sanctions Work: Iran and the Impact of Economic Warfare, authored in 2024 by Narges Bajoghli, Vali Nasr, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, and Ali Vaez; and Bucking the Buck: US Financial Sanctions and the International Backlash against the Dollar, written by Daniel McDowell in 2023. In How Sanctions Work, the authors explore the effectiveness of sanctions on Iran over 200 pages. They argue that US sanctions on that country have failed to achieve key foreign policy objectives while causing severe unintended consequences. The book emphasises the extensive humanitarian crises and social damage caused by sanctions through interviews with diverse Iranians, including academics, businesspersons, and so forth. It also reviews Iran's political history, protests, and contrasting policies on US relations. The book then traces the history of sanctions from Jimmy Carter (1977–1981) to Joe Biden (2021–2024), illustrating how sanctions have failed to achieve regime change or secure major concessions and how even lifting sanctions is complicated by political risks, as seen during Donald Trump's (2017–2021) and Biden's presidencies. Ultimately, the book evaluates secondary sanctions, which involve additional economic restrictions designed to ban economic activities of agents who are not subject to US territorial and personal jurisdiction, from transacting with a target of US sanctions. The second book, Bucking the Buck, examines the growing resistance to the US dollar's dominance in global finance. Written by Daniel McDowell, a professor of International Affairs at Syracuse University and an expert on financial sanctions, the book presents timely insights into how US sanctions drive global efforts toward de-dollarisation, making it highly relevant to current geopolitical debates. Supported by quantitative, data-driven research, the book addresses gaps in the literature on US foreign policy, dollar dominance, and the effectiveness of sanctions. The book explores mechanisms like correspondent banking and US Treasury enforcement, detailing how sanctions leverage the dollar to exclude foreign actors from the financial system. The book also examines the dollar's role as a store of value, the responses of countries like Russia, China, and Venezuela, the rise of gold reserves, and efforts to internationalise rivals such as the euro and the renminbi. In How Sanctions Work, the authors present a thesis known as the 'sanctions counterproductive overreliance,' which proposes that sanctions, when used broadly, can lead to outcomes that undermine the policy goals they were intended to achieve. Using US sanctions on Iran as a case study, demonstrates how these measures, aimed at kerbing Iran's nuclear ambitions, limiting its regional influence, and promoting political reform, have instead strengthened Iran's resistance to external pressures. This has fostered the development of a 'resistive economy' (7) focused on self-sufficiency, with efforts to bolster domestic industries and deepen ties with non-Western nations. The book also analyses how sanctions have encouraged national solidarity in Iran, with the population—especially the political elite—rallying around the government against foreign pressure. The 'resistive economy' has driven innovation in sectors like energy, agriculture, and defence, making Iran's economy more resilient. Instead of causing instability or regime change, as the US intended, the sanctions have enabled Iran to develop alternative economic and political alliances, particularly with China and Russia. In a complementary argument, Bucking the Buck argues (18) that US financial sanctions, by introducing political risk into the international currency system, have spurred de-dollarisation—diminishing the dollar's dominance in global trade. Using case studies from Russia, China, and Venezuela, the book shows how these nations have responded by diversifying currency reserves, developing alternative payment systems, and trading in currencies like the euro, renminbi, and cryptocurrencies, driven by the dollar's use as a geopolitical weapon. Bucking the Buck examines how US sanctions leverage the dollar's dominance in global trade, clearing systems, and reserves to isolate targeted states effectively. However, this strategy undermines confidence in the dollar, prompting nations to seek alternatives. By using the dollar as a geopolitical tool, the US inadvertently accelerates de-dollarisation, threatening its currency's global supremacy and potentially shifting the balance of economic power. Problem-solving theories of sanctions seek to address the deficiencies of sanctions by approaching them from a sender-centred lens, drawing from Eurocentric and Atlantic-centric discourses, to cover how and when sanctions succeed, from various different lenses, such as liberalism, realism, or institutionalism. How Sanctions Work aligns with the liberal perspective on sanctions, as indicated by the claim that 'the pressure on the living standards of ordinary Iranians was always central to the rationale behind sanctions, which was expected to result in them applying indirect pressure on the government to alter its behaviour' (76). This statement underlines the liberal belief that sanctions are designed to create economic hardships that force citizens in the sanctioned country to impose pressure on their government for policy change—especially in authoritarian regimes where direct political engagement may be restricted. This perspective aligns with Johan Galtung's (1967) 'naïve theory' of sanctions, which suggests that sanctions create popular discontent, leading to internal pressure on governments. According to this theory, sanctions are meant to make life challenging for civilians, urging them to rise up for political change. Nevertheless, Galtung criticises this view as simplistic and excessively optimistic, arguing that it assumes hardships will spontaneously translate into political pressure. Conversely, Bucking the Buck analyses the topic through liberal and institutional theories on sanctions. In contrast to liberalism, institutionalism explores how international institutions shape and apply sanctions to enhance coordination and legitimacy. It also adopts three other distinct schools of thought that emphasise maintaining the dominance of the US dollar: the political economy of sanctions, currency competition theory, and geopolitical risk theory. The first theory connects to Bucking the Buck's argument that US financial sanctions create political risk, illustrating how using the dollar as a geopolitical weapon can prompt targeted states to seek alternatives. The second theory explains shifts in currency dominance and implications for global trade and finance as countries begin conducting trade in currencies other than the dollar, such as the euro and renminbi. Lastly, in the third framework, the book explores how geopolitical manoeuvres can create economic vulnerabilities and provoke systemic changes. Both books examine various theories of sanctions, including liberalism, political economy of sanctions, currency competition theory, and geopolitical risk theory, demonstrating how US sanctions can be counterproductive when they are overly relied upon and how then can push targeted states to seek alternatives to the dollar, impacting global trade and currency confidence. However, these books are ultimately complementary as they employ sender-lens perspective to ameliorate the deficiencies of sanctions - aiming to answer how and when without profoundly questioning why some sanctioned countries succeed or fail to counteract sanctions. The strength of How Sanctions Work lies in its nuanced analysis of the impacts of US sanctions on Iran, particularly how this overreliance has prompted Iran to develop resistance strategies. Key factors contributing to the book's effectiveness involve its strong emphasis on empirical evidence from in-depth ethnography, interviews with key stakeholders and academics, and economic data analysis. Moreover, it explores the broader geopolitical implications of US sanctions, highlighting how Iran's responses challenge US foreign policy by reshaping alliances in the Middle East and fostering cooperation with non-Western countries like China and Russia. Additionally, the book's insightful case study explores specific sectors like oil, banking, and healthcare, demonstrating the diverse impacts of sanctions across industries. These case studies enhance readers' understanding of how sanctions disturb daily life in Iran and how various actors, from the government to local businesses, adapt to the changing economic landscape. In contrast, Bucking the Buck excels in its detailed analysis of US dollar's dominance in the global financial system and the extensive impacts of US sanctions on targeted states and global financial dynamics. A key strength of the book is its robust theoretical framework, which integrates concepts from international political economy, currency competition, and geopolitical risk theory, providing a comprehensive understanding of how US dollar maintains its dominance. This theoretical grounding builds the discussion on how sanctions disrupt the economies of targeted states while also challenging global financial stability. Another significant contribution of the book is its focus on rising challenges to the dollar, particularly the process of de-dollarisation. The author explores how targeted states, especially Russia and China, are increasingly pursuing alternatives to the dollar by establishing bilateral trade agreements in local currencies, expanding cryptocurrency use, and creating new financial institutions. This global perspective on de-dollarisation clarifies how US sanctions have unintentionally sped up efforts of countries to reduce their dependence on dollar, potentially threatening its future dominance. Each chapter of Bucking the Buck builds upon the last to present a cohesive, structured argument about the long-term implications of US sanctions on the global financial system. Insightful case studies explain how countries like Russia, China, Turkey, and Venezuela have responded to sanctions, while statistical models propose empirical support for the arguments. These models help quantify the economic impacts of sanctions, providing concrete evidence of their impacts on both targeted economies and the global financial order. In contrast, How Sanctions Work lacks thematic cohesion, covering a wide range of topics without uniting them under a clear central theme, while its omission of statistical models further weakens its empirical support. Moreover, the book fails to conceptualise and characterise sanctions within existing sanctions theories, it generalises the concept of 'resistance' without accurately defining it, offering only implicit descriptions, and the analysis of the global costs of sanctions for both the US and the world is limited, as it does not address anti-sanctions rhetoric or the growing international concerns regarding the US dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. These shortcomings prevent the book from providing a more comprehensive and rigorously supported analysis of sanctions. Such serious accusations require brief substantiation. The authors study the impact of sanctions on poverty, food shortages, healthcare, education quality, and humanitarian suffering, but they fail to label sanctions as primary and secondary or clearly differentiate between comprehensive and smart sanctions. This implies a conflation of comprehensive and smart sanctions, as comprehensive sanctions broadly impact entire sectors, affecting widespread hardship, while smart sanctions target specific individuals or sectors to lessen collateral damage to civilians. How Sanctions Work mainly focuses on comprehensive sanctions while downplaying smart ones, which are referred to only briefly on page 55. By neglecting this important distinction, the book lumps all restrictive measures under the broad term 'sanctions,' hiding their nuanced effects. For instance, it mentions on page 70 that 'the Trump administration levied over 1500 sanction designations against Iran as part of its 'maximum pressure' campaign', suggesting a blanket increase in sanctions. However, many of these were smart sanctions targeting specific individuals and entities within Iran's economy, differing significantly from comprehensive sanctions, which generally have broader and more detrimental effects on the population. By failing to categorise and analyse these distinctions properly, the authors risk overgeneralising the complexities of US foreign policy and its economic coercion tools. The book also downplays secondary sanctions by discussing them implicitly without systematically explaining their triggers. It mentions closing Iran's access to the Brussels-based Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) (64), classified under the trigger 'Use of US financial system' (Davies & Kent, 2020). However, it fails to draw attention to the US dollar's dominance in international transactions and financial markets as a key funding and investment currency. The US does not need a direct economic relationship with the target to impose economic coercion; rather, US financial sanctions derive their power from the structure of the global financial system. However, secondary sanctions also rely on two additional triggers: the use of US technology and control by a US company. The first trigger bans the re-exportation of US-origin items, specifically technology, to sanctioned countries, expanding the scope of secondary sanctions to include global supply chains that incorporate US components, even in small amounts. This places a significant burden on international companies, requiring them to ensure that none of their products or technologies trace back to US origin. The second trigger indicates that secondary sanctions apply not only to companies in the US but also to those not incorporated in the US if they are majority-owned or controlled by a US 'person' (Ruys & Ryngaert, 2020). This grants US sanctions a global jurisdictional reach, compelling foreign businesses with US ties to comply with American foreign policy. The book fails to see these triggers, downplaying the widespread and complex nature of secondary sanctions, which are now a critical tool in US economic statecraft. While the first book effectively details the impacts of sanctions on Iran and its society, it lacks a broader theoretical grounding to improve its analysis and provide deeper insights. Without a cohesive framework, the work risks a fragmented view of the complex sanctions landscape. Although much of the sanctions literature, including this book, examines the effectiveness of economic coercion, it ignores theories addressing this issue, mentioning the liberal view only briefly on page 76. By not engaging more deeply with liberal perspectives or comparing them with theories such as realism, PCT, institutionalism, and neo-weberianism, the authors lose the chance to advance their analysis and explain why sanctions succeed or fail. Their attempts to evaluate resistance to sanctions is also weakened by this neglect of underlying reasons, undermining their analysis and reducing its overall strength. As readers begin the book, they frequently encounter the term 'resistance,' but it lacks a clear conceptualisation to address the underlying 'why' question. The definition of resistance remains unclear; for example, it states, 'after 4 decades, it is clear that those incentives have not pushed Iran toward a more just society and a more peaceful role in the world. Instead, sanctions have created an economy both resilient and resistant' (7). While the book discusses some economically resistive mechanisms like non-oil products (82), e-commerce (24), and women-led charity networks (23), it mainly overlooks the significant growth of knowledge-based enterprises and a parallel economy, as highlighted by interviewees I spoke with in my own research between April and June 2024 in Iran. A CEO of a knowledge-based firm, for example, told me that, 'knowledge-based start-ups, supported by the government, have been actively functioning in Iran for almost 20 years, yielding impressive outcomes'. Furthermore, a CEO of an Iranian cancer control centre mentioned a parallel economy, saying that some companies facilitate the transit of medical equipment through third countries before reaching Iran, acknowledging that while this process raises costs, it still allows access to necessary equipment despite sanctions. The authors recognise the limited effect of sanctions on the target country but overlook broader consequences for the US, particularly the dollar's status in sustaining global power. Sanctions could unintentionally undermine dollar's dominance by prompting de-dollarisation strategies. While overreliance on sanctions is seen as counterproductive, the authors ignore the specific impact of Iranian sanctions on the dollar. John Kerry, former US Secretary of State (2013–2017), warned that re-imposing sanctions on Iran could jeopardise the dollar's reserve currency status (Strobel, 2015). As such, overusing financial sanctions may debilitate US leverage as countries shift to alternative financial systems. While the initial book downplays the significance of secondary sanctions by overlooking their triggers, especially the dominance of US dollar in international transactions, Bucking the Buck addresses this gap by stressing the importance of controlling global mechanisms of financial transactions through dollars. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) enforces sanctions primarily through the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which names individuals the US seeks to isolate. US-based financial institutions are unable to process transactions for those on SDN list and may need to freeze their assets. Violators in the financial industry encounter serious penalties, including long prison sentences and fines. Banks also risk significant fines and reputational damage for non-compliance, motivating them to closely monitor and report any transactions involving SDNs. In contrast to How Sanctions Work, the second book benefits from a more structured and consistent approach, effectively synthesising various aspects of its analysis. The book provides a plain explanation of the dollar's role in the sanctions mechanism but does not categorise comprehensive and smart sanctions as 'primary' ones. This omission may confuse readers about the distinction between primary and secondary sanctions. For instance, statements like, ""institutions found to be in violation of US sanctions also face reputational damage. Such severe penalties encourage banks to self-monitor and self-report"" (41) are misleadingly categorised under primary sanctions instead of secondary ones, further blurring the distinction. Bucking the Buck, like the earlier book, fails to address the importance of US technology and the influence of US companies that prompt secondary sanctions. By downplaying these elements and related theoretical frameworks, the book's literature review is undermined, ultimately limiting the effectiveness of its argument and understanding of the sanctions landscape. The book frames de-dollarisation as a response to US-led financial sanctions, considering it part of the 'resistive' strategies used by sanctioned countries. While McDowell addresses how de-dollarisation happens and references resistance in Iran, Bucking the Buck explores it narrowly, avoiding the reasons behind it. He does examine the strong correlation between the threat of sanctions and their effects, stating that this can deter US financial settlements. Nonetheless, like the earlier book, he does not assess the reasons for the success or failure of anti-dollar policies in realising de-dollarisation, leaving the ontological basis of these outcomes unexplored. The author also overlooks a key factor in examining anti-dollar policies: the extent and intensity of sanctions. Countries facing severe sanctions, especially multilateral ones, could have fewer possibilities for currency diversification. It seems that strict sanctions can reduce foreign reserves remarkably, making it harder to move away from the dollar, minimising the likelihood of success. For instance, the extensive multilateral sanctions between 2006 and 2010, mainly due to Iran's nuclear programme, left the country with limited response options. In this constrained environment, reserve diversification caused volatility and unexpected exchange rate fluctuations in Iran's foreign exchange markets. Despite challenges, Tehran has not remained passive. The Iranian government and merchants use alternative money transfer systems, like hawala, to bypass dollar boundaries and sanctions. Originally from South Asia, hawala is a closed network operating through family or tribal connections. Nowadays, the term refers to a broader range of financial services that rely on non-bank settlement methods, such as trade-based and cash settlements, with extended settlement periods. By employing this method, sanctioned states like Iran can move money and carry out transactions without relying on the formal banking system. The trade-based system helps avoid restrictions and allows businesses or individuals to continue financial activities despite the sanctions. The most common hawala settlement method involves value transfer through trade transactions, often via over- or under-invoicing, a widespread practice in Iran. Hawala operators use excess funds to pay for trade transactions, compensating recipients in the remittance destination. This informal system, embedded in regional networks, is often tied to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a hub for hawala activity. Over 300,000 Iranians and 8200 Iranian-owned companies in Dubai facilitate trade-based transfers for sanctioned countries like Iran (US Department of State, 2015). This mechanism is closely related to the declaration of the aforementioned CEO of the knowledge-based firm who reminded me in Tehran that 'individuals working in the gaming industry sometimes register companies in other countries, such as the UAE, to address issues related to international transactions and to conduct business on behalf of these companies'. The previously mentioned hawala mechanism in an example of this practice. An Iranian manufacturing company seeks to buy or sell a product and identifies a supplier or buyer, before placing a provisional order. To prevent triggering secondary sanctions, Iran uses shell companies and front businesses located in the UAE. These entities function as intermediaries, facilitating the transactions on behalf of Iranian companies without directly linking the deal to Iran. Operating in UAE free trade zones with less oversight, these companies allow Iran to continue trade, like importing goods or exporting oil, while avoiding direct sanctions. Iran also uses a barter system, exchanging goods and services without money, the oldest form of trade. In response to the Trump administration's 'maximum pressure' campaign in 2018, Iran established a 'barter committee' to organise key ministries in exchanging crude oil for necessary commodities. As such, Iran views bilateral barter agreements as crucial for trade, especially with neighbouring countries. Recent examples include a general barter agreement with Pakistan, a deal with Russia for industrial products, and an agreement with India to exchange tea to settle old debt. Barter deals with countries that are subject to Western sanctions—such as Iran, Russia, and Venezuela—are often more viable, as both parties face similar economic constraints and restrictions in accessing international markets. Since these nations are principally excluded from the global financial system, bartering permits them to evade the use of conventional banking channels and avoid the risk of violating sanctions related to monetary transactions. Additionally, such deals provide a mutual advantage, enabling the exchange of essential goods and resources without the complications of external regulatory oversight. This shared experience of sanctions pressure fosters stronger economic cooperation and builds resistance against Western punitive measures. In conclusion, while How Sanctions Work and Bucking the Buck offer valuable insights into US sanctions, each has strengths and limitations. How Sanctions Work excels in empirical analysis, specifically on Iran, but lacks theoretical strength in distinguishing sanctions and characterising resistance. Bucking the Buck provides a clearer analysis of US dollar dominance and de-dollarisation but omits key issues like secondary sanctions and the role of US technology. Both books improve our understanding of sanctions, but a more integrated and theoretically robust approach would improve their analyses of the broader geopolitical and economic impacts. One future research area could include examining the interaction between sanctions and de-dollarisation attempts, focusing on the reasons for the success or failure of such efforts in sanctioned countries. As explored in Bucking the Buck, sanctions are often seen as a catalyst for accelerating de-dollarisation. However, the book does not fully address the complexities of informal economic systems in sanctioned countries, such as hawala and bartering systems, which may play a crucial role in shaping de-dollarisation outcomes. For example, while sanctioned countries may aim to shift to alternative currencies like the euro, renminbi, or even cryptocurrencies, the persistence of informal economies complicates these transitions, as they are often profoundly embedded and resistant to formal monetary policy changes. This gap invites research on how informal economies could serve as models for other sanctioned countries. For example, Iran's use of hawala and barter systems offers valuable lessons, but understanding their functioning and sustainability is key. Additionally, examining the global implications of sustained de-dollarisation—such as its potential to weaken US financial dominance—could propose insights into the sustainability of alternatives like cryptocurrencies and non-dollar trade agreements. Another key research area is the need for more rigorous definitions and conceptual clarity around 'resistance' to sanctions, as emphasised in How Sanctions Work. While the book examines some strategies used by countries to thwart the impact of sanctions, it falls short in offering a consistent conceptualisation and characterisation of resistance. As such, resistance can manifest in various ways, including sanctions resistant, partially sanctions resistant, and sanctions non-resistant. Further studies could attempt to develop a more inclusive theoretical framework for these strategies. For instance, can the creation of parallel economies and informal financial structures be considered forms of institutional resistance? Or do they represent temporary adaptations that lack long-term viability? Moreover, there is room to examine how these strategies might be formalised into more permanent, state-sanctioned systems, and what conditions are necessary for this formalisation to occur. This could involve a deeper examination of how governments in sanctioned countries interact with local elites, business networks, and international actors to stabilise informal economies and turn them into sources of resistance. By systematically exploring the relationship between informal economies and formal state responses to sanctions, scholars can better comprehend how resistance involves not only reactive but also proactive strategies that shape the political and economic landscape in sanctioned countries. Moreover, this research could clarify the factors that determine whether these strategies succeed in improving long-term resilience or, alternatively, intensify the vulnerabilities that sanctions aim to develop. To shift the perspective on sanctions from a sender-centred approach—concentrating on when and how sanctions are effective—to a target-centred approach that assesses why sanctions work or not, I examined two prominent and methodologically robust books. Both How Sanctions Work, authored by Narges Bajoghli, Vali Nasr, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, and Ali Vaez and Bucking the Buck, written by Danel McDowell, investigate the efficiency of sanctions, emphasising their unintended consequences. The former argues that US sanctions on Iran have not only failed to achieve their primary goals, in particular regime change, but have also fostered a 'resistive economy' that enhances Iran's degree of resilience. The latter study shows how US financial sanctions have prompted countries like Russia and China to pursue de-dollarisation, decreasing their reliance on US dollar in response to geopolitical pressures. Both works highlight that overusing sanctions can backfire, with How Sanctions Work noting that sanctions have strengthened national solidarity in Iran instead of prompting regime change, while Bucking the Buck demonstrates how isolating adversarial states has encouraged them to pursue alternatives to the dollar, potentially undermining its global dominance. While both books present compelling arguments and contribute to the discourse on sanctions, How Sanctions Work is more persuasive in its detailed exploration of the social impacts of sanctions on Iran. Its empirical foundation allows for a nuanced understanding of the lived realities of societies under sanctions, which is crucial for understanding the broader implications of US foreign policy. On the other hand, Bucking the Buck provides an important perspective on the global financial system's intricacies and the potential threats to dollar dominance posed by sanctioned states. Its theoretical insights are significant for understanding the broader economic implications of sanctions, but the lack of detailed examination of resistive mechanisms limits its effectiveness. The strengths of these books complement each other, offering a multifaceted perspective on sanctions and their effects. Together, they provide a richer understanding of how sanctions function and their broader implications for targeted states and the global order. By synthesising insights from both works, scholars and policymakers can better grasp the complexities of economic sanctions and the resistance strategies they inspire. Future research might examine the intersection of sanctions, de-dollarisation, and resistance, particularly the role of informal economies, and develop clearer conceptual frameworks around sanctions resistance. This would enhance understanding of how sanctioned countries navigate economic punitive measures and whether such strategies foster resilience or exacerbate vulnerabilities.

"Integrated Marketing Chain Pattern of Smallholder Rubber Commodities in The Southern Region of Papua Province, Indonesia","Smallholder plantations drive economic growth, provide livelihoods, and support conservation, such as rubber, coffee, and cocoa widely cultivated, including rubber in Papua since the colonial era. This research aims to analyze rubber cultivation's history, development, and challenges in Southern Papua and identify strategies to optimize rubber commodities' supply chain and marketing. The study used qualitative and quantitative approaches, including historical data analysis, interviews with farmers and traders, and analysis of rubber prices from 2009 to 2016. The data are analyzed using the QSPM method to determine strategic priorities based on internal and external factors. The results show that since 1969, rubber development in the region has been facilitated by Catholic missionaries, who played a key role in education and the distribution of rubber seedlings. However, the global decline in rubber prices since 2013 has reduced farmer incomes, with many halting rubber sheet production. Supply chain barriers, such as difficult transportation and a lack of partnerships between farmers and traders, further exacerbate the situation. To address these challenges, the research recommends several strategies. In the short term, rubber plantation rejuvenation and strengthening partnerships between farmers and traders are needed. In the medium term, strengthening cooperatives and financial institutions and supporting production and marketing should be prioritized. In the long term, new processing machinery should be introduced, and medium-scale rubber processing factories should be established—rubber plantations in Merauke face price fluctuations, transportation issues, and weak partnerships. The research suggests rejuvenating plantations, strengthening cooperatives, and building processing factories to improve sustainability.",2024-12-23,
Factors of sustainable development of the grain market of the Russian Federation and assessment of their impact on the competitiveness of domestic grain producers,"In the presented article, the author substantiates the need to take into account the full variety of ex-ternal and internal factors of sustainable development of the grain market as an important condition for compliance with the standards of a highly competitive global grain market. The purpose of the study was to systematize and stratify ESG factors depending on the specific ecological, economic, social and infrastructural results obtained by the industry, as well as their correlation with those adaptation and optimization tools that can provide domestic grain producers with long-term strategic competitiveness in world markets, as well as increase the financial and economic results of the industry even in conditions of high volatility of supply and demand. The result of the conducted research and a certain increment of theoretical and methodological knowledge on this topic was a model of sustainable development of the grain market of the Russian Federation, reflecting the relationship of factors influencing the industry and adaptation industry tools, the use of which is based on those financial capabilities of grain producers, which were identified in the article as part of the description of the new transformed economic model of the grain market. The author substantiates the high efficiency and prospects of integration into the grain industry of both ESG principles and clustering, pointing out that the cluster development path facilitates the procedures for financing sustainable agricultural practices and simplifies the processes of conducting scientific research and implementing the best available technologies. At the same time, the state needs to implement certain protectionist measures against the grain industry, which should support its development during a period of serious geopolitical shifts and conjunctural fluctuations in financial and commodity markets.",2024-12-23,

Analisis Hubungan Antara Kasus Korupsi Harvey Moeis dan Setya Novanto serta Kaitannya dengan Hukum Tata Negara dan Undang-Undang NRI 1945,"Corruption is an unlawful act that aims to enrich oneself, others, or a corporation, which in turn results in financial losses or has a negative impact on the country's economy. The definition of corruption itself is regulated in Law Number 31 Year 1999, which was later amended to Law Number 20 Year 2001. The harmful actions were committed by Harvey Moeis and Setyo Novanto. The losses incurred by each suspect were Rp 2.3 trillion and Rp 300 trillion, respectively. The writing method used in this article is literature study. This method can be done by collecting references consisting of several previous studies and then compiling them to draw conclusions. The corruption case committed by Harvey Moeis was related to the management of thyme commodity trading in Indonesian territory with a state loss of Rp 300 trillion, then the E-KTP case that dragged Setya Novanto's name. He is suspected of arranging for the project to be approved by the House of Representatives. Both cases violate Article 20A of Law Number 20 of 2001 and Law Number 31 of 1999 on the eradication of corruption. This case calls into question the accountability of public officials, especially in the case of Setya Novanto, the authority of state institutions over this case and the rule of law upheld in Indonesian constitutional law.",2024-12-23,
Political Crisis Following the Adoption of the Third Universal in the Context of Land Issues in Ukraine.,"Research aim. This article explains the internal economic and social preconditions for the governmental crisis that followed the adoption of the Third Universal by the Central Rada, considering systemic economic factors that shaped the stance of the Ukrainian government regarding land reforms at that time. Methodology of the research. The analysis of internal crisis factors focuses on various elements, including the nature of landlord estates in Ukrainian governorates at the beginning of the 20th century, the distribution of land among rural households unable to engage in commercial production due to land scarcity and lack of resources to sustain draft animals, as well as the programmatic positions of Ukrainian socialist-oriented parties regarding land reform directions. The scientific novelty. This study demonstrates that the political crisis stemming from the adoption of the Third Universal was triggered by the government's inability to resolve contradictions between the need to maintain a commodity-based agricultural system–primarily upheld by large, capitalist-style privately-owned estates closely linked to financial capital, which occupied a significant portion of Ukraine's agricultural lands–and the need to allocate land to peasants as a basic means of subsistence for rural families. The article highlights that, according to the socialist parties' agendas, one approach considered by the Central Rada and its government for resolving these contradictions was to establish collective farms on the basis of landlord estates. Conclusions. By the early 20th century, large-scale landownership in Ukraine had already acquired a capitalist nature in terms of both organization and integration into market relations. However, the limited volume of land available for redistribution made it impossible to allocate enough land for all peasants to conduct commercial farming. Consequently, land reform based on the redistribution of landlord lands neither had an anti-feudal character, promoted capitalist relations, nor could it mitigate the severe agrarian crisis. Under these conditions, the leadership of the General Secretariat for Land Affairs of the Central Rada pursued a policy aimed at preserving large, capitalized estates of a latifundial type, which conflicted with the mass peasant movement advocating for an egalitarian redistribution of land ownership. As a result, the Central Rada lost its primary social base–the Ukrainian peasantry–which ultimately led to its removal from the historical stage.",2024-12-23,
Machine Learning WTI Crude Oil Price Predictions,"Energy commodity price forecasts have always been quite important to a lot of market participants. To tackle the problem, our analysis looks at West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices on a daily basis. The sample under inquiry covers 10 years, from April 4, 2014 to April 3, 2024, and the price series under analysis has major financial implications. Here, Gaussian process regression methods are developed using Bayesian optimization techniques and cross–validation processes, and the resulting strategies are utilized to provide price projections. The relative root mean square error of 2.2743% indicates that our empirical prediction approach produces reasonably accurate price estimates for the out-of-sample assessment period of April 19, 2022–April 3, 2024. Models of price predictions give investors and governments the information they need to make wise choices about the crude oil market.",2024-12-21,
Strategising the behavior of exporters in target global markets,"International trade is an important component of economic growth, so it is important to find an effective way to enter international markets that will bring positive results in both the short and long term. The study provides recommendations on how exporters should enter international markets, as exports enhance economic development and a country’s position in the global economy. Nowadays, the issue of entering the international market is closely related to the tools for supporting and promoting exports, as the market is highly competitive. The article identifies economic and additional incentive instruments for export promotion. Economic instruments include financial and tax instruments, while additional incentives are based on the use of administrative and marketing measures. An important part of the work is the analysis of global trends in commodity exports, which make it clear the importance of specific commodity sectors. The study also includes methods and indicators for assessing the effectiveness of the export support system, which allows countries to measure the impact of export support and promotion activities, as the effectiveness of instruments for one country will not always have the same effectiveness in another country. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukrainian exporters have faced many challenges, which is why effective strategy is of paramount importance for the country’s development. One of the biggest problems in Ukraine’s exports is the high volume of raw material exports and the high number of imported value-added products, which is why the issue of export support and promotion is a relevant topic of research. The key regions for Ukrainian exports were selected in this study: European, Asian, American, African, Australian and Oceania. The choice of regions is based on the strategy of diversifying export markets. Ukraine already needs to minimise risks in international trade in order to avoid risks that may arise when it joins the European Union, as our national economic interests closely overlap with other countries of this integration association. The recommendations provided to Ukrainian exporters have been adapted to specific parts of the region that have certain peculiarities. At the end of the description of important aspects for entering the market of a particular region, promising sectors have been suggested based on the importance of this industry for the country or region.",2024-12-21,
Aggregated Inflation in Poland: Examining Impact of the Energy Commodity Global Prices,"The relationship between energy commodity prices and inflation has important implications for fiscal policy and economic stability. The nature of energy commodities is multi‑dimensional, serving both as basic raw materials in production processes and as critical consumer goods. This study focuses on estimating the impact of oil, natural gas and coal prices on inflation in Poland. Through the adoption of multiple regression models using quarterly data from Q2 2000 to Q3 2023, the study aims to estimate the impact of energy commodity prices, particularly oil, coal, and natural gas, on inflation in Poland and to answer the research question: What role do energy commodity prices play in shaping inflation in Poland? The empirical analysis revealed that oil and coal prices significantly influence inflation, reflecting Poland’s energy dependency. Natural gas prices showed a limited impact due to lower consumption and mitigation policy measures. The significant impact of energy prices suggests that energy market developments should be closely monitored for their inflationary potential. The study offers valuable insights for policymakers in their efforts to effectively manage inflationary pressure. The article contributes to the literature by presenting the short‑run relationship between inflation and energy commodity prices, covering long period of time with both financial, COVID‑19 crisis and the Russian aggression in Ukraine.",2024-12-21,
Ancient numismatists and the seasteading movement,"I read with great interest how the Nordic krone, Venezuelan petro, and New Russian ruble alternative currencies emerged as a result of the US dollar's crash in 2040. As an archeologist and scholar of more traditional forms of currency (what might more accurately be termed exchange valuables)—and coupled with the knowledge of what has passed in the sixty years since these currencies developed—I would like to provide a temporal perspective on why the compendium of monetary instruments owes part of its origin to legacy units of exchange, their ultimate transformation due to various economic and sociopolitical factors, and climate-driven reasons behind the rise of the Oceanic vaka (VKA) digital unit. As noted in Mandirola's (2025) brochure on the subject, ""money is not neutral"" and is ""an active agent in creating the ways in which wealth is generated, circulated, and distributed."" As a reminder, it is worth pointing out a much-discussed topic in economic theory and anthropology, and that is how money—so fundamental in state-level societies across human history—became a critical and integral piece of political economies (see, e.g., Davies, 2002; Pitluck et al., 2018; Weatherford, 1997). While space here does not allow for a full review of the myriad concepts and variations that have prevailed over the last few thousand years, suffice to say that money must fulfill three basic criteria: The note or coin has to be (a) a medium of exchange with a set value that can be used to pay for things or services, (b) a store of value that avoids the issue of both parties needing to desire goods or services in a trade scenario while also retaining purchasing power over time, and (c) a measure of value that assures that the unit of account can serve as a common denomination and has a relative measure of worth. The three alternative currencies described by Mandirola (2025) all served to try to solve—with some degree of success—how they could become both economically stable (i.e., reducing volatility in the markets) and profitable after US dollar transactions became transparent and traceable vis-à-vis the Honest Currencies program. This seemingly well-intended philosophical facet of financial engineering, at least on the surface, had some unintended effects that led to skyrocketing unemployment and the deportation of migrant workers on whom the American agricultural sector relied and from whose loss it subsequently never recovered. Along with the decline of the dollar in international reserves and investors no longer accepting US currency, the economy collapsed. The development of these new alternative currencies in response to the US dollar's demise needed to address several major concerns. These included removing or severely inhibiting the illicit tampering of each currency while ensuring government solvency. The results were the development of vastly different systems, each couched within the sociocultural peculiarities inherent across Scandinavia, Venezuela, and Russia. In essence, these three new alternative currencies achieved their goals until 2062, when a major phenomenon began to arise and changed the optics of monetary policy for most nations. This was a direct outgrowth of forced retreat and emigration due to climate-induced sea level rise, forcing a greater emphasis on living alternatives for those displaced along the world's coastal margins. During the mid-2010s, seasteading (i.e., habitable floating islands) became an increasingly popular and effective means of challenging political authority (Quirk & Friedman, 2017) while ensuring economic viability for those living under oppressive regimes, such as in Venezuela and Russia. It also allowed people across a broad spectrum of economic classes to regain or attain some of the autonomy that had been persecuted in their home nations. These habitable and movable structures, most of which were mass-produced and quite sophisticated, included built-in desalinization, waste management, and recycling systems; aerial and submarine drones; deployable purse seiners to capture seafood; and a combination of solar power, sails, and hydroelectric motors to harvest renewable energy sources to facilitate movement across large bodies of water. Similar to the floating cities found today—and not unlike the mega cruise ships popular in the mid-21st century, prior to massive avian influenza outbreaks (but without the immense multistory structures that were controlled by a single company or country)—these seasteading units could be autonomous or joined with others to form multimodule sea villages comprising tens or hundreds of separate domiciles. The impetus for these was clearly inspired by the earliest seafaring peoples, who crossed larger bodies of water thousands of years ago in search of new homes in response to overpopulation, a lack of resources, and/or autocratic rulers (Figure 1). These early traditional floating villages typically involved lashing canoes to each other and/or larger bamboo platforms and were once quite common across the Indo-Pacific. These not only became an effective way to facilitate trade but also created aquatic communities and established a level of autonomy that was completely movable and malleable.

The remoteness and isolation of many island groups, such as Hawai'i and the atolls of Micronesia, forced early inhabitants circa 1500–3000 years ago to create trade linkages with other islanders so that they could acquire needed or desired resources, find marriage partners, and assist with catastrophes (sometimes called the rescue effect). The disparate nature of some resources in the Pacific, notably pearl and Spondylus shells manufactured into beads or other objects, led to these becoming highly prized. In other places, like the Indian Ocean and West Africa, cowry shells became extremely valuable. The historical and symbolic importance of cowries cannot be understated. In Ghana, the national currency is the cedi, which translates to ""cowry."" Arguably the most famous example of portable object exchange in the Pacific, and notable in its own right on a global scale, is the stone money (rai) of Yap. For centuries before European contact (ca. 1200–1500 CE), the Yapese of western Micronesia traveled hundreds of miles over open ocean to the Palauan archipelago to carve disks of limestone, a relatively scarce resource not found in Yap. These disks were brought back on canoes or rafts and used in a variety of social and economic transactions. In the 1800s, Euro-Americans became involved with the transport of laborers and rai on larger ships using metal tools; stone money disks thus increased in size and number, leading to de facto inflation. Astonishingly, some of these disks exceeded two to three meters in diameter and weighed more than five or six metric tons (Fitzpatrick, 2008; Hazell & Fitzpatrick, 2006), though smaller disks carved precontact using shell and stone tools were considered much more valuable. An interesting facet of this exchange was that the stones, once brought to Yap, were rarely or ever moved again. To keep track of ownership, the Yapese kept an oral ledger among community members and later transposed this to a digital blockchain network (i.e., the Yapese Digital Ledger; YDL) that was accessible only by the high chiefs in the Council of Pilung. Even those rai lost offshore in rough seas during transport were considered so valuable that they could still be exchanged. It has been argued that these attributes, particularly the lack of a need for physical ownership of stone money for them to have value, may have been the impetus and inspiration for Bitcoin and its use of blockchain technology (Fitzpatrick & McKeon, 2020; Nakamoto, 2008) (Figure 2). Source: Photograph by the author Source: Gillilland (1975) Source: Photograph by the author Source: Photograph courtesy of Brad Holland Source: Photograph by the author In the 60 or so years since the failed Honest Currency program, seasteading has emerged as a prolific, sustainable, and politically influential force by establishing newly formed social groups, known as aquahives, that comprise independent, interlocking residential units that are free from any national government oversight outside of a nation's respective exclusive economic zone. While early seafaring societies often bartered to acquire needed goods or services given their smaller and mostly egalitarian nature, these modular aquahives could at times reach up to a thousand or more individual family and commerce units. This became even more critical with sea level rise drowning the world's coastlines. Seasteading provided a way for islanders to stay connected to what remained of their homeland, but with the flexibility to move if and when necessary. However, an immediate concern for all seasteaders regardless of location was how to also ensure financial flexibility after leaving their homelands and renouncing citizenship. This required a stable, digital alternative currency so that funds were easily accessible and transferable, but also potentially attractive to investors outside of the seasteading movement. Cryptocurrencies were one option, but the massive requirements for electricity and computing power were beyond the immediate capabilities of seasteaders even when harnessing the combined energy storage of larger aquahives, and keeping a crypto mining farm landlocked would have also defeated the purpose of seasteading autonomy. The tremendous growth of seasteading that emerged from different nations and dialects also necessitated a monetary unit that could be used within and between all participant groups and those with whom they interacted. This new currency was termed the Oceanic vaka, a Polynesian word for ""canoe,"" in deference to the exceptional seafaring skills of Pacific Islanders, who settled the most remote patches of land on earth. In a twist of irony, it was the ancient numismatists of Yap—with their tradition of carving and moving large limestone disks of stone money and their history of interconnections with smaller atoll groups as part of the ancient sawei exchange system—who became the centralized banking hub to which the VKA was tethered. In the 1930s, the Japanese administration had counted more than 13,000 rai in Yap, though an island-wide inventory conducted by archeologists in 2044 revealed only 3554 still intact. Their value, roughly akin to how the value of diamonds was assessed (cut, color, clarity, and carats [weight/size])—but importantly for the Yapese, also according to each stone's pedigree—was integrated into the YDL. From this, one hundred million VKA currency units were divided and unequally distributed among the total rai inventory based on their five uniquely assigned attributes. Although rai as a medium of exchange did not have nonmonetary uses, like gold did, their rarity and pedigrees dating back centuries were sufficient to help stone money retain a high level of demand on the antiquities market. The upside was price stability, whereby there was no feasible way for seasteaders (or governments) to inflate prices by expanding supply, though the downside was that the Yapese were highly unlikely to sell rai. This was not a strict monetary policy, however, and the Yap state government sold one rai each year to the highest bidder, often generating more than triple its VKA value. The revenue generated served to support all Yapese government services, with the remaining 50% reintroduced into the digital chain. As such, VKA digital units became not only an established currency but the preferred monetary unit among coastal cities with seasteading ports of manufacture and repair.",2024-12-20,
Beyond the S&amp;P 500: examining the role of external volatilities in market forecasting,"Abstract This study examines the impact of various exogenous volatilities on S&amp;P 500 volatility using HAR-RV-type models. In this regard, a diverse range of exogenous volatilities—including assets, commodities, oil, gold, bonds, interest rates, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), and the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index—are incorporated into the Heterogenous Autoregressive (HAR) model. The exogenous volatilities are classified into three groups: European Market Information, U.S. Market Information, and U.S. Financial and Policy-Related Information. The study aims to determine which group of information contributes most effectively to forecasting S&amp;P 500 stock market volatility. The results reveal several noteworthy points. First, the predictive accuracy of the baseline HAR-RV model is improved by incorporating exogenous explanatory variables. Second, the combination and the kitchen-sink approaches outperform models with single exogenous regressors, particularly for the U.S. Market Information group. Third, the U.S. Market Information group demonstrates superior predictive power compared to the other two groups, highlighting the interconnected nature of U.S. financial markets.",2024-12-20,

Kata kunci: Kepastian Hukum, Cryptocurrency, E-commerce, Inovasi Digital, Regulasi Indonesia. Abstract In recent years, the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of transaction in e-commerce has been increasing, but regulatory uncertainty in Indonesia has created a dilemma for businesses and consumers. Although recognized as a digital commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti), the use of cryptocurrency as an official means of payment is still prohibited by Bank Indonesia. This study aims to examine the legal certainty of the use of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce transactions in Indonesia and compare it with countries such as Japan and the European Union which already have a more mature legal framework. Using a normative method, this study examines applicable regulations and their impact on the e-commerce sector. The results of the study show that regulatory uncertainty hinders cryptocurrency innovation and adoption in Indonesia. A harmonious and collaborative legal framework is needed to create legal certainty and protect consumers. More comprehensive regulations are expected to encourage the development of the digital economy and increase Indonesia's competitiveness in the global market.

The Importance of Bitcoin and Commodities as Investment Diversifiers in OPEC and Non-OPEC Countries,"The study aims to critically assess the safe-haven properties of Bitcoin and a diverse set of commodities in mitigating stock market risks during periods of extreme financial turbulence. Specifically, this research seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of these assets as hedging tools or diversifiers in the portfolios of both OPEC and non-OPEC countries, focusing on their behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. We employ a wavelet coherence approach to analyze the dynamic relationships between the variables. Portfolio optimization is conducted using CVaR to assess the effectiveness of these assets as safe havens, hedges, or diversification tools in mitigating financial risks during periods of heightened market volatility. The diversification benefits of commodities and Bitcoin in OPEC and non-OPEC stock portfolios decrease over time as their co-movement with stock markets increases. During the COVID-19 period, BTC did not act as a safe haven. However, gold served as a hedge for non-OPEC countries. Using CVaR, we found that BTC provides stronger diversification benefits than commodities, followed by gold. We examine the safe-haven role of Bitcoin and various commodities, specifically within the context of both OPEC and non-OPEC countries. Our study offers a more comprehensive analysis of how BTC and commodities function as portfolio assets during financial stress, providing valuable insights for investors and policymakers.",2024-12-19,
TWO The UK Food System,"This chapter examines the UK food system, its physical and financial flows of people and products, and considers critical assessments by food policy experts such as Tim Lang and Henry Dimbleby, who wrote a national food strategy at the request of the UK government in 2019. The chapter proceeds to explore the UK's food security through examination of export and import trade flows of key food commodities, before looking at the UK's diet and food provisioning habits. It concludes that at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic early in 2020, the UK food system might be described as robust in terms of trade, supply chains and logistics but inherently weak with regard to diet, health, social justice and equality.",2024-12-19,
"Assistance in Calculating Cost of Goods Sold (HPP) at UMKM Penyetan Hot Nyot in Dadirejo Village, Pekalongan","Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Dadirejo Village, Pekalongan, will receive support and training on financial reporting.

Analisis Perlakuan Akuntansi berdasarkan SAK Indonesia untuk UMKM studi kasus pada X-Barue Coffee Banyuwangi,"-Barue Coffee is an MSME that operates in the coffee management sector located in Kalibaru, Banyuwangi. Coffee is a plantation commodity that has a harvest period once a year, so financial management is very important in the running of this business. Good financial management must start from proper recording and quality financial reports in order to provide clear and complete financial information, and support appropriate decision making. Recording must refer to applicable accounting standards, namely the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards for Micro, Small and Medium Entities (EMKM). This research aims to (1) analyze accounting accounting in recording transactions (2) understand in depth the financial management of X-Barue Coffee MSMEs. The method used in this research uses a qualitative method with a case study approach, data is collected through observation and interviews. The sample collection technique uses purposive sampling. The research results show that X-Barue Coffee MSMEs still use simple manual recording methods, are not in accordance with Indonesian SAK for EMKM, and there is a mixture of personal and business wealth. In financial management, X-Barue Coffee concerns planning, recording, reporting and financial control, but it is still not optimal according to the established standards.",2024-12-19,
Navigating access and benefit sharing in international trade of endemic species: The case of Colombia's poison frogs (Dendrobatidae),"Abstract Wildlife is an important global commodity that generates significant revenue along the supply chain, including economic benefits in range states for sought‐after species. However, international trade in wild species is often associated with over‐exploitation and illegal extraction. To regulate, monitor, and ensure the sustainability of such trade, over 180 countries have ratified the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Using national data collected through CITES processes, we undertook a network analysis to evaluate the structure and dynamics of international trade in six CITES‐listed species of Colombian endemic poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). We assessed the magnitude of the international trade and the countries that were reporting legal imports/exports, both before and after Colombia allowed legal exports of these species, to examine the changes associated with Colombia's export legalization and to draw conclusions about the country's role and benefits from trade in these species. Our analyses show that, for over two decades, international trade of CITES‐listed species likely in contravention of the Convention resulted in significant exports—and likely greater financial benefits—accruing in non‐range states through reported captive breeding programs. Although the market was reconfigured when Colombia legalized the export of certain endemic frog species, non‐range states with founder stocks obtained from unknown and possibly illegal sources continue to account for a significant portion of the trade volume of some species (mostly, Phyllobates spp.). We discuss the importance of enforcing regulations and collaborations that promote better traceability of international commerce of endemic species to ensure the legitimacy of transactions, economic benefits for origin countries, and the conservation of species in the wild.",2024-12-18,
"Problems of the Labour Theory of Value, Money, and the State Form","The article articulates four theses towards a properly value theoretic account of of contemporary capitalism. First, money precedes capitalism by millennia, implying that there is a process of becoming a measure of value in capitalism. Second, even conceived within a strictly capitalist commodity economy, money is already an inherently imperfect measure of value as socially necessary labour time. Third, commodity money as world money only operated through national and international coordination. Fourth, the end of the Bretton Woods system removed any objective measure making price and price dislocations incomprehensible without incorporating an understanding of the role of states and their monetary practices. States are a vital, endogenous, part of modern capitalism, whose capacities are limited by capital and should be theorized in value theoretic terms, but with a specific, non-determined moment of their own, with profound consequences. This implies that recent financialization shouldn't be seen as an escape from a lost world of successful Keynesian management but as one in which state actions actively reproduce finance and financial instability.",2024-12-18,
Evaluating SMEs Exchange as an Emerging Platform in India,"Stock exchanges are the cornerstones of every nation’s growth, and capital markets are the nation’s foundation too. Hence, the growth of the Stock Markets of the world is directly related to the production of the economy of every country. It can be noted from the last few years that the stock markets have expanded to suit the unmet needs. Stock market improvement has been created, and different products have been produced to meet the requirements. Commodities and the financial markets are the correct examples. The goal of this paper is to assess that the SME exchange provides companies with a new forum from which they can transfer to the exchange’s main board. Till 2022, 107 companies have been transferred from NSE Emerge to the NSE mainboard market. The research hypothesis of the paper is to measure the performance of the companies that migrated from the SME’s exchange to the main board of the NSE market. Using the independent sample t check with SPSS tools, we took a survey of 107 companies from the NSE Emerge that is being evaluated for their success before and after migration. This study’s added value is to measure that whether the migration is a mean of increasing the profitability of the migrated company or not. We used the statistical tool independent sample t test on pre- and post-migration return differences. Our analysis reveals that when a corporation opts for a main board (NSE) listing, its shares often generate a favourable anomalous return although it was not found significant for post-migration return capabilities.",2024-12-18,
Economic analysis of the influence of the structure of commodity producers on the efficiency of agriculture in Turkestan region,"The purpose of research is to determine the impact of various forms of farming on the efficiency of agriculture in Turkestan region using econometric models, which will make it possible to formulate proposals for improving agricultural policy in the region. Research hypothesis. It is assumed that the structure of commodity producers has a significant impact on the efficiency of agriculture in Turkestan region. In particular, larger agrarian enterprises show high productivity and economic efficiency due to the scale of production and access to better technologies. At the same time, farmers and smallholders can make important contributions to the diversity of production and sustainability of the agrarian economy, but their efficiency may be limited by insufficient access to financial and technical resources. In the course of the study, the authors used methods of literature review of domestic and foreign researchers, statistical method, economic and mathematical method, modelling, etc. The result of the study is the development of proposals to optimise the structure of agriculture in the region, including measures to support small and medium-sized farms to improve their competitiveness, as well as the development of cooperation between producers to improve their access to resources and technology.",2024-12-18,
An innovative voting ensemble learning approach for sorting and classifying date fruit varieties,"Dates are among Algeria's most significant agricultural crops due to their considerable health and financial benefits. Moreover, they constitute an essential export commodity beyond the hydrocarbon sector. The current traditional methods for classifying and sorting dates are inefficient, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, resulting in a disparity between limited exports and high production levels. This study proposes an Ensemble Learning (EL) model that employs Transfer Learning (TL) techniques to address impediments and enhance date fruit categorization. We evaluate the performance of four classifiers: MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, DenseNet201, and EL soft voting classifier that uses these TL methods, work on a set of 1,619 images of 20 different varieties of Algerian dates. The dataset ranks among the largest benchmarks for varietal variety. The proposed hybrid model has outstanding performance, with a validation accuracy of 98.67% and a classification accuracy of 99.92%. It sets a novel standard in agricultural technology by surpassing all evaluated models in precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings illustrate the approach's capacity to entirely revolutionize date sorting and significantly enhance agricultural productivity and efficiency.",2024-12-18,
Terrorist Financing: Traditional vs. Emerging Financial Technologies,"This study examines the use of traditional systems and emerging financial technologies for terrorist financing based on a dataset comprising 121 cases around the world. While there are speculations that terrorists are largely adopting emerging FinTechs like cryptocurrencies, our exploratory findings indicate that only 7 percent of cases involve such technologies. Traditional payment systems are still dominant, accounting for 93 percent of cases. Terrorist financiers primarily rely on the banking system and employ methods such as foreign shell companies, money transfers, Hawala systems, and high-value commodities. Research and policy implications for law enforcement and public authorities are discussed.",2024-12-17,
DO MACROECONOMICS AND COMMODITIES PREDICT STOCK MARKET?,"The stock market is a leading indicator and barometer of a nation’s economics and is influenced by a wide of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and global commodity prices. One of the consequential effects of the stock market is foreign exchange. International commodity prices, such as tin, may have an impact on the stock market too. Foreign exchange and the stock market are two significant components of the financial system, and the price of commodities has been a concern for industrialists, economists, and researchers in recent years. This research examines the effect of foreign exchange and commodities on the stock market, uses daily data from the beginning of January 2020 to the end of December 2023, and applies the Generalized Auto Regression Conditional Heterokedasticity (GARCH) method. The findings show that foreign exchange has a negative significant effect on the stock market, while commodities have a positive and significant effect on the stock",2024-12-17,
Introduction,"For the past 75 years, environmental economists and scholars in other fields have included environmental valuation as a tool in their toolkit. Environmental goods are not transferred and bought in the markets. Due to the lack of a market price for environmental goods or resources, or those goods that do not have a market price such as air, water, natural landscapes, still the economists and policymakers, through the use of non-market valuation (NMV) methods, determine and quantify their monetary value. Traditionally, it is considered a tool of non-market valuation. But the roots of NMV methods can be traced back to classical economists like Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, but they did not develop specific methods to measure non-market goods. NMV has its roots in development economics. Market prices are poor indications of the underlying economic value; NMV is employed when the market is distorted, or commodities and services have no market (Roussel and Tardieu, 2018). As such, determining the true value or the costs of such products or services posed a challenge to the researcher. To tackle the issue, scientists developed several methods that make it possible to develop financial indicators that evaluate gains or losses associated with changes in the quality of these goods or services. The goal is not just to assign a monetary value to a non-market environmental good, but the challenges of creating practical policy tools based on solid theory and avoiding political misuse. Instead, the aim is to equip decision-makers with the tools they need to take appropriate political actions, guide the resource allocation, imposition of tax policies, and the development of compensation schemes.",2024-12-17,
Improvement of the legal status of the Personal peasant households in Ukraine in the conditions of martial law and European integration,"The article is devoted to the analysis of scientific material and the legal framework regarding the legal status of Personal peasant households (PPH) in Ukraine in the conditions of war and European integration. But the goal of introducing such a form of individual management along with the prevailing collective forms of land management in the Soviet period was significantly different from the tasks facing the PPH now. According to the Kyiv School of Economics, by 2021, 41.5% of products were produced by individuals - households. They dominate in animal husbandry, in the production of potatoes, vegetables, etc. It seems that a similar trend persists even now, in the conditions of martial law and European integration processes in our country and is a serious basis for ensuring food security in our country in conditions of war. Therefore, further research and improvement of legal status of PPH seems expedient. Official statistics prove a steady tendency to reduce their number. PPH is an economic activity that is carried out without creating legal entity by natural person individually or by persons who are in family or family relations and live together, in order to satisfy personal needs through the production, processing and consumption of agricultural products, the sale of their surpluses and the provision of services using the property of personal peasant household, including in the field of rural green tourism. Therefore, in the light of European integration and the most modern studies of European legislation, PPH fits perfectly into the modern European agrarian production system. The immediate tasks for improving the legal status of PPH are the review of approaches to the legal regime of their lands and the improvement of the mechanism of their state support with the subsequent transition to the European model of such support for small commodity producers. The legal regime of land plots for РРН should be comprehensive with permission to build manor house and hotel type residential buildings. State financial support of РРН should be on the same level as of the other producers of agricultural products.",2024-12-16,
Main types and types of document flow in institutions of post-graduate education in Ukraine,"The last third of the 20th century was marked by the transition of a number of countries to the information civilization, under which the majority of workers are employed in the field of information activities, and the main product of production and commodity is information. Currently, information has become the most important resource of society and has acquired strategic importance. Globalization of world processes, on the one hand, and deep socio-political and economic transformations that unfolded in the 1990s, on the other, created the prerequisites for Ukraine’s rapid entry into the global information space. In the new century, the future of our country will largely depend on how energetically and effectively it moves in this direction. Information processes actively affect all aspects of human life. The use of the latest information technologies multiplies this influence. Most of the information is recorded on various material media, contained in various documents. The role of information in the management process is particularly important - at all its levels and in all spheres: political, economic, scientific, cultural, etc. Documenting information, its search, processing, storage and transmission require significant financial, material, labor resources and time. Therefore, the organization of effective work with documents, improvement of all information and documentation processes both on the scale of society as a whole and at the level of individual enterprises, organizations, and institutions is an extremely important direction of management activity. In turn, qualified work with documented information requires a significant number of professionally trained specialists. The current stage of Ukraine’s development is characterized by a difficult and contradictory path of the country’s transition to a market economy. Without a doubt, the success of this transition largely depends on the effectiveness of the management structures of the market economy, whose activities are based on the production and use of information, a large part of which in any organization, as mentioned above, is concentrated in documents.",2024-12-16,

10 RNN models for evaluating financial indices: examining volatility and demand-supply shifts in financial markets during COVID-19,"Several semi-recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were developed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial indices representing bond market (yield spread - Spread), energy market (crude oil prices - Oil), stock market (volatility index - VIX and Wilshire 5,000 total market index - Wil5,000), housing market (Shiller housing price index - HPI), commodity market (Gold, Wheat, and Soybean indices), and recession (USrec). The indices were divided into two groups based on two properties: volatility and demand-supply shifts. USrec was a part of both groups. Two time-series datasets (dataset 1 and dataset 2) were obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for the two groups. The volatility and demand-supply shift groups had daily and monthly data, respectively. Each dataset was first purified by applying derived-breakpoints (the transition block) for each index, separately. Second, the purified dataset was partitioned into ""before"" and ""during"" the pandemic. Semi-RNNs were trained by the training sets for the ""before"" and ""during"", separately, and tested against their corresponding test sets which delivered two 5-element counter arrays. Each array carries the overall percent of the correct classifications of the indices for the entire records of the corresponding test sets. A decay rate was calculated for each index in the arrays and the average of decay rates (overall decay) is also calculated for each array to be used for inspecting the impact of COVID-19 on indices. The positive, zero, and negative decay rate means COVID-19 has negative, none, and positive impacts on the financial indices, respectively. The results also revealed: (a) VIX was explained by Wil5,000, Spread, Oil, and USrec more accurately before the pandemic, indicating that other observed and unobserved factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic would affect the VIX more than the other financial indices. (b) USrec is predicted less accurately compared to other indices during the pandemic, which shows the sensitivity of this index to health and geopolitical challenges. (c) Effects of the indices on the bond market diminished during the pandemic. (d) HPI declines in predic tive accuracy during the pandemic indicate disruptions in the housing market due to economic and social changes. (e) Gold price drop in predictive accuracy during the pandemic reflects its nature as a relatively stable safe-haven but still sensitive to COVID-19. (f) Wheat's substantial drop in predictive accuracy highlights its sensitivity to disrupted supply chains, global trade dynamics, and fluctuating demands during the pandemic. (g) Similar to wheat, soybean predictive accuracy fell during the pandemic, underscoring the impact of supply chain disruptions on agricultural commodities. The sensitivity analysis suggests that the results remain highly robust to the changes in the number of records chosen for the different test sets.",2024-12-16,
Konsep dan Peran Uang dalam Perspektif Ekonomi Islam,"This research examines the concept of money from an Islamic economic perspective which is fundamentally different from conventional economic views. In Islam, money is not a commodity that can be traded for profit. Money is a medium of exchange that must be used to support real economic activities and contribute to social welfare. The basic principles of Islamic economics, such as the prohibition of usury, gharar, and maysir strictly regulate the use of money so that it cannot be used for speculative activities that have the potential to be detrimental. This research aims to analyze the role of money in Islamic economics, explore its application in the Islamic financial system, and assess its impact on wealth distribution and economic stability. The research results show that the concept of money in Islam emphasizes justice, ethics and balance in the economy, and can provide a more sustainable alternative compared to conventional financial systems which often pursue maximum profits without paying attention to social impacts. This research concludes that the application of money principles in Islamic economics can support the creation of a fairer and more inclusive financial system and contribute to the overall economic welfare of the people.",2024-12-14,
The Impact of Equity Financing Moderation on Global Supply Chain Management and Corporate Performance Relationship,"The main urban environmental problems are poor air quality, the urban heat island effect, water quality deterioration and flooding, environmental biodiversity needs, increased waste flows, and excessive carbon emissions levels. Many of these issues, especially the urban heat island effect and stormwater runoff, have a greater impact and stronger influence on post-industrial cities more emphatically influence post-industrial cities, because of their specific development patterns. Cities face many environmental challenges, including air and water quality problems, the need for adequate green space, excessive heat gain, contaminated stormwater runoff and lack of biodiversity ecosystem. Urban agriculture offers a unique opportunity to utilize vacant or idle land and rooftops throughout cities for the production of oxygen and healthy pesticide-free food. Adding residential green space to a neighborhood, including community gardens and urban farms, is known to provide a number of social, health, economic, and environmental benefits. Despite the challenging global trends, some citizens believe that Indonesia presents the resilience trend as displayed across the region, and we are ready to keep moving forward together for the years. In 2021 President of the Republic of Indonesia, Bpk Joko Widodo, officially established National Food Agency in Indonesia. This agency is ministered under the Ministry of Agriculture Food Security Agency, led by Bpk Arief Prasetyo Adi, and the Ministry of Economy, led by Bpk Airlangga Hartarto. The need for food and the market is very large and will continue to grow. However, the development of the food sector requires innovative methods based on modern technology, which will be able to increase the efficiency of the production process and the quality of food that is affordable and able to improve the carrying capacity of the environment, as well as the welfare of farmers and their supporting sectors. The purpose of this research is to provide information for executives to contribute to the development of the supply chain management talent, including the primary drivers, benefits, barriers, and bridges. The challenging macroeconomic and political environment is also putting pressure on the global business sector. Large companies have reported shrinking profit margins due to rising costs. Among small businesses, bankruptcy rates have begun to rise as borrowing costs rise and financial support dwindles. Emerging markets face many risks related to a strong US dollar, high external borrowing costs, persistently high inflation, volatility in commodity markets, increased uncertainty on the outlook for economic conditions in global economies, and pressure from tightening policies in advanced economies.",2024-12-13,
Dinamika Kebijakan Moneter dan Diplomasi Ekonomi dalam Menjaga Stabilitas Nilai Tukar,"This study examines the dynamics of monetary policy and economic diplomacy in maintaining the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate in the context of Indonesia’s international financial market. Indonesia’s economic stability is closely tied to the Rupiah’s value, which is influenced by both domestic economic policies and external global factors. The study analyzes the effectiveness of various monetary policy instruments used by Bank Indonesia, such as the benchmark interest rate, foreign exchange market interventions, open market operations, and minimum reserve requirements. Furthermore, it explores the role of economic diplomacy, including bilateral swap agreements and international cooperation, in enhancing Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves and stabilizing the Rupiah. Despite these efforts, external challenges such as global economic uncertainty, commodity price volatility, and geopolitical tensions continue to pose risks to exchange rate stability. The study concludes with strategic recommendations for strengthening monetary policy, including diversification of foreign exchange revenue, enhancing domestic financial markets, and fostering synergy between fiscal and monetary policies.",2024-12-13,
Facing Sender States: Russia’s Smart Power and Energy Security Strategy to Survive from Sanctions 2022-2023,"This paper aims to explain Russia's efforts to face sender states for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since February 2022. Including EU countries, the US and its alliances, sender states have gradually imposed various economic sanctions on Russia as target state ranging from freezing state and individual assets to cutting off import and export activities aimed at halting Russia's invasion. Russia, in the aftermath of this, experienced various problems, in particular energy sector as top commodities yet Russia economy has not collapsed. As smart power (regarded as a combination of hard and soft power) and energy security as frameworks are proposed, authors seek to analyze how Russia deals with and survives from the economic sanctions. Previous studies have not addressed how Russia's efforts to deal with economic sanctions examined from the two concepts, thus this article seeks to fill the gap. Using qualitative research methods and the two concepts, authors found that Russia only employed hard power as coercive actions to deal with sender states through a bunch of energy and non-energy instruments. Russia, one of the largest energy exporters and regarding energy security strategy, has undertaken three strategic aspects; energy source sovereignty, foreign market access and financial security for investment.

"Evaluating diversification approaches: A comparative analysis of traditional, Islamic indices in the United Kingdom, and alternative investment options","This study explores the diversification potential of the United Kingdom’s (UK) conventional and Islamic stock indices, Bitcoin, gold, crude oil, and the GBP/USD exchange rate from 2011 to 2022 using methodologies such as VECM, MODWT, MGARCH-DCC, and CWT. The findings indicate that UK indices, gold, and Bitcoin respond to changes in crude oil prices and GBP/USD rates, whereas GBP/USD and crude oil show low correlation, offering diversification benefits. Gold consistently maintains a low correlation with UK indices during global disruptions, such as the 2020 pandemic and the 2022 Ukraine-Russia conflict, reinforcing its reliability as a diversification asset. However, Bitcoin shows potential as a diversification tool despite its high volatility, which is a concern. Crude oil’s effectiveness as a diversification asset diminishes for holding periods beyond 64 trading days. The study also reveals that the global financial crisis significantly impacted both UK Islamic and conventional indices, challenging the role of the Islamic index as a safe haven and suggesting that Shariah screening may not necessarily shield Islamic markets during economic downturns. These findings provide investors with essential insights into selecting equity indices and commodities for portfolio diversification and underscore the importance of advanced methodologies to understand correlation and volatility dynamics.",2024-12-12,
Systemic risk and contagion in the commodity market: identifying volatility transmission during crisis periods,"The commodity market is a key element of the global economy. It is influenced by the political and economic situation of the major participants on the supply and demand side, as exemplified by the geopolitical and economic situation related to the conflict in Ukraine. Another aspect of this influence is the close relationship between commodity markets and financial markets. Both factors contribute to the possibility of the commodity market becoming subject to contagion, resulting in the transfer of supply and demand shocks and volatility. The aim of this article is to identify the commodities that are the source of contagion (volatility) during the transmission of shocks and the increase of systematic risk in selected periods. Combining traditional network theory with vector autoregression (VAR) model, we aim to estimate systemic linkages as a measure of systemic risk and the contagion process underlying it. We used time series of commodity returns from the Refinitiv Eikon database to observe the relationships between commodities during crisis periods, starting from 2006. The results suggest that the commodities with the largest increase in volatility transmission compared to the pre-crisis period acted as a transmission gate for market shocks.",2024-12-12,
Shaking the coffee market,"Cryptocurrencies can be negotiated during trading and non-trading days. Such characteristic enables some innovative analysis between contemporary financial resources and the traditional market assets. In this manuscript, we focus on two assets that are related to the same commodity: coffee. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper was to analyze the impact of returns-based information during non-trading days from a coffee-related cryptocurrency (namely: Coffee Coin® - CFCN) on the returns of coffee futures returns after these non-trading days. The dataset comprises historical prices of BM&amp;F Arabica Coffee Futures, collected from Refinitiv Eikon (Thomson Reuters). Based on time series analysis, the main results suggest that CFCN volatility on non-trading days (particularly, holidays) can be used as a relevant indicator related to coffee futures contract. This evidence can also complement the literature on market anomalies, since we address two calendar patterns: the Monday and the Holiday effects.",2024-12-11,
A Darwinian Approach via ML to the Analysis of Cryptocurrencies’ Returns,"Abstract This study adopts a Darwinian approach leveraging machine learning (ML) to analyze cryptocurrency returns and their interactions with traditional financial markets. Using a daily dataset from 2018 to 2023, the Random Forest model proved particularly effective in identifying key factors influencing cryptocurrency returns, including technology stock indices (NASDAQ), global equity indices (S&amp;P500, Eurostoxx600), commodity prices (gold, crude oil), and market sentiment (Google Trends). The analysis reveals consistent positive relationships between market sentiment and cryptocurrency returns, highlighting the crucial role of public interest in shaping long-term outcomes. Cryptocurrencies emerge as a distinct asset class with specific correlations to traditional markets and investor sentiment. The study provides strategic insights into understanding cryptocurrency behavior and integrating these dynamics into informed portfolio strategies. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring both traditional financial indices and market sentiment for investment decisions across various time horizons. JEL classification numbers: C58, G11, G15.

Demonstrating Research Quality,"It is a truism that research papers that take account of previous studies and report interesting findings are of little merit if the methodology lacks rigour. Such papers are of no value to nurses or nursing if the science is wrong. As editors, we often get frustrated when what initially appears to be an interesting paper has to be rejected because the authors did not convince us that the research approach was robust and systematic. Rigorously designed and conducted research enables transparency and reproducibility, qualities valued by funders and governments. Journals play an important role in promoting such work. Because of our experience, the Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing is publishing a series of articles to assist authors in producing research papers that demonstrate excellence in design and execution. Quality mental health nursing research focuses on building evidence to improve the care of those with lived experience. However, research users, such as practitioners or policymakers, must have faith in what researchers produce. Much research is publicly funded, regardless of whether the grants come from governments (taxpayers) or charities (donations). It is in the interest of these bodies to ensure that money from the public purse only funds high-quality research. As a result, many countries have developed processes for evaluating the quality of research conducted in their publicly funded universities. For instance, since 1986, the United Kingdom has run research assessment exercises every 5–7 years, with other countries emulating this. The initial drive for this was primarily economic and initiated by the Thatcher Government, which was fundamentally suspicious of academia and wanted to bring market forces to bear on all aspects of economic, social and cultural life (Harvey 2005). As a consequence, academic research became a measurable commodity aligned with government business and linked to financial incentives. Universities are now regarded as key contributors to the performance of the economy. While its origins were within the United Kingdom (Research Assessment Exercise, followed by the Excellence Framework [REF]), this approach to evaluating academic research has been copied in at least 20 other countries. For example, Hong Kong, Poland, Sweden and Norway. New Zealand and Australia have also conducted similar quality research assessments but have paused their planned upcoming evaluations. For some countries, the amount of annual research funding that a university obtains from the government is informed by the results of these research assessment exercises. It is often the case that the quality of research is judged by an assessment of a university's research publications, research impact and research environment. We will concentrate here on the quality of publications, which is assessed on originality, significance and rigour. It will come as little surprise to readers that good quality research papers must adhere to these three criteria. However, it is surprising how many of the 700 manuscripts that are submitted to this journal each year do not mention these three words. As far as originality is concerned, editors and reviewers are seeking evidence of the research having been built on previous studies to push forward the boundaries of knowledge on the topic. The questions asked include—was the study the first to investigate the topic, did it produce and interpret new findings, engage with new problems, develop new research methods or analytical approaches, provide new arguments, interpretations or insights, collect new types of data or advance theory, policy or practice? It is important that the authors make the case for originality and not have editors or reviewers second guessing this. Authors should also make the case for significance or what may be referred to as the potential impact of the study's findings. How, for instance, do the findings advance or have the potential to advance knowledge, skills, scholarly thought or the development and understanding of practice, education, management or policy? The timeliness of the research may also suggest significance, as is its contribution to theory-building or theory-testing. As alluded to above, without rigour, the integrity of originality and significance is undermined. Therefore, rigour is of specific importance to any evaluation of publication quality. It can be defined as the extent to which the research demonstrates intellectual coherence and integrity, using robust and appropriate concepts, analyses, sources, theories and/or methodologies. We will now deal with how rigour is assured in quantitative and qualitative research studies. In quantitative research, the focus is on the application of theory, research designs, methodologies and procedures to generate hypotheses and test them. It aims to produce research findings with internal and external validity and reliability. Internal validity is concerned with how a study is designed, conducted and analysed and the procedural sureties we put in place to maximise the study's inferential impact. External validity is concerned with whether the findings of a study are generalisable to other settings. This also includes ecological validity, the measure of applicability to practice settings. It is these measures that raise a paper from parochial relevance to international excellence and world-leading importance, thereby increasing its publish-ability and research assessment worth. The 'a priori' and objective nature of quantitative research means that issues affecting validity, such as inappropriate research design, sampling issues, poor instrument selection, limited statistical analysis, etc., need to be addressed before data collection commences. Once data collection begins, there is no opportunity for correction. Many irreversible internal and external validity errors were made because researchers did not consult a methodologist/statistician early enough in the conceptualisation stage. Remember, there are limits to what statistical techniques can correct. Journal reviewers are often left feeling that the authors could have substantially strengthened the paper for publication if they had a better understanding and application of quantitative methods. Rigour in qualitative research involves providing an auditable decision trail of the design, conduct and reporting. A rationale needs to be provided for each step of the research process. Arguably, it is the research question that drives the design and reporting of the research. It must be clearly focused and supported by evidence. It also needs to be underpinned by a strong conceptual framework, which informs the selection of appropriate research methods. This enhances trustworthiness and minimises the researcher bias sometimes inherent in qualitative methodologies (Johnson, Adkins, and Chauvin 2020). The research question is foundational to the choice of conceptual framework, methodology and design of a qualitative study, and these facilitate the research process that best answers the research question. Furthermore, each phase of the study must be described in terms of its relevance to the research question. The research plan (recruitment, data collection and data analysis) should also systematically examine the research question within a relevant context. One common problem seen in qualitative papers in research assessment exercises and reviews for publication is that the research question is not resolved in the findings. A well-designed interview (or other data collection method) will capture complex data pertinent to the research question. An interview that gets side-tracked (by data that may be interesting but not pertinent) or one that fails to interrogate the participants' descriptions in relation to the overarching research question will produce insubstantial data for analysis. The analysis should be driven by both the methodological approach and the research question, and the reporting of findings needs to reflect the outcomes of the analysis. The analytic process is a systematic interpretation supported by evidence from the data. It needs to focus on interpretation rather than description alone, that is, what does the data mean in terms of the research questions and how does the analysis reflect the methodological approach? Sometimes, submissions to the Journal report under-analysed data. This may take the form of 'themes' that reproduce responses to the interview questions. These should be designed to elicit responses to the research question. It is an example of insufficient analysis when responses are reported without interpretation. The interpretation needs to be guided by the methodological approach or, in the case of thematic analysis within the conceptual framework. Following these rules enables others to ascertain whether the findings might be relevant to their clinical practice. In conclusion, regardless of whether the research approach is quantitative or qualitative, the publication should show scientific excellence in design, method, execution and analysis. It should demonstrate a systematic and rigorous approach to its relationship with existing research, be adequately detailed for replication purposes, error sources are identified, accounted for and minimised and limitations are highlighted. The Journal of Psychiatry and Mental Health Nursing is publishing a series of research methodology papers covering both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. For the former, they deal with philosophical paradigms, research designs, data collection methods and psychometric and statistical analysis techniques. For qualitative research, three papers focus on understanding the place of qualitative research in mental health nursing practice, conducting qualitative research and publishing qualitative research studies. The overall aim of these series is to enhance the quality of research papers submitted to the journal to increase understanding of the research process and improve the application of findings (internal/external validity) to produce good quality, rigorous research of high international relevance.

The Impact of US Macroeconomic Factors on Bitcoin Prices: A Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) Model Analysis,"Having emerged as a significant asset in the global financial landscape, particularly in the past decade, Bitcoin not only offers a decentralized alternative to financial traditions, but also potential for speculating and value storing. As Bitcoin matures, its impact on financial markets also grows rapidly, making it a critical subject for study. This paper focuses on the impact of seven selected key U.S. macroeconomic factors on Bitcoin prices by running a Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) model and performing Impulse Response Function (IRF) analyses. The indicators aim to stand for macroeconomic aspects including monetary policies, economic and market performance, inflation, commodity prices, and currency value. After obtaining quarterly time series from 2010 to 2024, a VAR model was utilized, attempting to capture dynamic relationships and lagged effects between the variables. The findings are expected to offer insights into Bitcoins dynamic interactions with macroeconomic conditions and prospects, especially for investors considering Bitcoin as a potential hedge in their portfolio and researcher interested in related topics.",2024-12-09,
Research on the Role of Risk Hedging and Arbitrage Strategies in Financial Derivatives Investment,"In financial derivatives investment, risk hedging and arbitrage strategies play a key role. Risk hedging aims to reduce the uncertainty caused by asset price fluctuations and provide investors with stable returns through derivatives such as futures, options, and credit default swaps (CDS). This strategy is widely used by enterprises and financial institutions to manage commodity prices, exchange rates, and credit risks. Arbitrage strategies use market price differences, especially pricing differences in different markets or at various time points, to seek risk-free or low-risk returns. This paper reviews existing literature on financial derivatives, sorting out the role of risk hedging in financial derivatives investment. It summarizes the basic principles, application cases, advantages, and limitations of risk hedging. Additionally, the research delves into the role of arbitrage strategies in financial derivatives investment, covering its basic principles, types, application cases, advantages, and limitations. This research finds that hedging strategies, through instruments such as futures, options, and credit default swaps, provide effective risk management by stabilizing returns and reducing the impact of market volatility. Arbitrage strategies, on the other hand, exploit market inefficiencies to generate low-risk or risk-free profits, thereby enhancing market efficiency and liquidity. Despite these advantages, this paper also highlights certain limitations, such as the complexity and cost of hedging instruments, and the diminishing arbitrage opportunities as markets become more efficient.",2024-12-09,
The Role of Regional Government in the Empowerment of Communities through Village-Owned Enterprises in North Lombok Regency,"The existence of Village-Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) in North Lombok Regency has not been optimal in empowering the community to support economic welfare. This is due to various challenges faced in the implementation of empowerment by regional govermet throught the P2KBPMD (Population Control, Family Planning, Community Empowerment, and Village) Office. This study aims to identify the role of the P2KBPMD Office in economic empowerment through BUMDes, as well as the challenges encountered during the empowerment process. The research employs a qualitative approach, with data collection carried out through observation, interviews, and documentation. The results show that the P2KBPMD Office empowers BUMDes through four main approaches: Human Resources Development (human resource development through management training and financial reporting), institutional development (institutional strengthening and evaluation meetings), business development (commodity selection, feasibility studies, and entrepreneurship development based on local advantages), environmental development (environmental development, which has not been implemented due to budget constraints), as well as Technology and Information Development. The challenges in empowering BUMDes include budget limitations and a lack of human resources, which hinder the optimal implementation of programs. The P2KBPMD Office is expected to seek additional funding sources from the central and provincial governments, or through cooperation with private sectors, and to conduct further studies on other factors such as village budgets, inter-village cooperation, institutional development, and other relevant variables.",2024-12-09,
Analysis of the financial derivatives for risk management in the context of financial market instability,"The study aimed to analyse the possibilities and efficiency of financial derivatives as instruments for hedging and minimizing risks in financial markets. The research methodology included the classification of financial derivatives according to various criteria, including their structure and underlying assets. The main types of derivatives were identified: futures, forwards, options and swaps used to hedge risks in the commodity and financial instruments markets. The results of the study indicate that financial derivatives are substantial in reducing the impact of negative changes in the market, opening new opportunities for investors and companies in the context of hedging, speculation and arbitrage. The study determined that the evolution of financial derivatives was driven by the need to adapt to constantly changing market conditions, especially during crises and periods of volatility. The study also addressed the impact of financial technologies (fintech) and blockchain technologies on the derivatives market, emphasising the importance of automation and increased transparency of transactions. As noted, the derivatives market had undergone significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies that had improved the availability and speed of trading. Particular attention was devoted to the analysis of the Ukrainian derivatives market, where economic and political instability creates a need for effective risk management. A separate element of the study was the development of a model for the effective use of financial derivatives for risk management based on the example of Kernel. The model included the stages of risk assessment, selection of appropriate financial instruments, as well as monitoring and adjustment of strategies. The findings of the study emphasize that the derivatives market in Ukraine is still in the development stage, which is due to the limited understanding of these instruments among market participants",2024-12-06,
Divine Trust ( <i>Amana</i> ) and Climate Change in Jordan: Valuing Water in the Face of Water Scarcity,"In the current context of environmental collapse and climate change, warnings about the threat of global severe water shortages have proliferated in media and policy discourses. At the same time, in many parts of the world, ordinary people, state institutions, and global financial actors are engaged in daily struggles over forms of water valuation. At stake in these struggles is the question: is water a commodity or a right? Based on ethnographic research conducted among Muslims and Christians in Jordan, this paper will explore how debates about forms of valuing water could be extended beyond the right/commodity and private property/commons distinctions to include religiously-informed forms of valuation. To do so, this paper shows how Muslims and Christians in Jordan provoke a mode of water valuation that is grounded in the idea of the ethical imperative to fulfil the amana (divine trust). Central to amana is the constant ethical labor of balancing the human right to govern/enjoy public resources such as water with divine responsibility. Amana affirms the value of water as a common good accessible to all and shared across generations while simultaneously making the realization of this value dependent on the divinely mediated relations of trust and obligation that hold together all of God's creation. As such, the stakes in this mode of valuing water go beyond the struggle to counter the financialization of public water to insist on the necessity of making space for a non-possessive relationship to water that is embedded in shared createdness and oriented towards the hereafter and accountability to God.",2024-12-05,
Forecasting gold price using technical analysis indicators,"Forecasting gold prices remains a complex challenge due to the volatile macroeconomic variables, market sentiment, and global events. This study explores the application of technical analysis indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Money Flow Index (MFI), Commodity Channel Index (CCI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) in order to predict short-term and long-term gold price movements. By analyzing these indicators across 1-month and 3-month timeframes on chart, the study provides a dual perspective on gold's behavior, capturing immediate price fluctuations and broader market trends. The results reveal that these indicators effectively identify overbought and oversold conditions, key support and resistance levels, and potential trend reversals. While gold prices are expected to maintain a bullish trajectory through 2025, the study highlights the possibility of moderate corrections in the short term. This research contributes to the literature on gold price forecasting, offering practical insights for investors and financial institutions aiming to refine their investing strategies in dynamic markets.

Market Dynamics of Short Covering: The Price Rebound Phenomenon and Double Peak Model in China’s Futures,"The present study examines the behavior of futures markets in the wake of widespread short selling and subsequent short covering, which frequently lead to notable price increases. Known as the ""Double Peak Model,"" this study provides a thorough analysis by synthesizing empirical data and recent literature. Data on futures contracts for different financial indices and commodities during periods of notable short interest and subsequent short covering are gathered for the study. Using statistical and econometric methods, the research examines trends in price movements and volatility. Key findings show that while short covering can result in sudden and sharp price increases, short selling can improve market efficiency and transparency by improving information flow. The study also emphasizes how crucial institutional involvement, legal frameworks, and market dynamics are in determining these price fluctuations. The Double Peak Model provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying market behaviors related to short selling and covering, which is useful information for traders, investors, and policymakers. These understandings are essential for creating sensible regulatory policies, enhancing risk management, and creating successful trading strategies.",2024-12-05,
"Comparative Analysis: Value at Risk (VaR) with Parametric Method, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Historical Simulation of Mining Companies in Indonesia","This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis between three Value at Risk (VaR) calculation methods, namely the Parametric (Variance-Covariance) method, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Historical Simulation, in measuring market risk in mining companies in Indonesia. The mining industry in Indonesia faces the risk of high commodity price volatility, thus requiring an appropriate approach in measuring potential financial losses. This study uses historical stock data from several major mining companies in Indonesia to analyse the difference in results between the three VaR methods. This study found that the smallest VaR value is owned by PTBA company. Along with the level of stability shows that PTBA company is more stable than other companies. This is inversely proportional to the TINS company which has a large VaR value and high volatility.",2024-12-05,
"Research on Financial Multi-Asset Portfolio Risk Prediction Model Based
  on Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Processing","In today's complex and volatile financial market environment, risk management of multi-asset portfolios faces significant challenges. Traditional risk assessment methods, due to their limited ability to capture complex correlations between assets, find it difficult to effectively cope with dynamic market changes. This paper proposes a multi-asset portfolio risk prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By utilizing image processing techniques, financial time series data are converted into two-dimensional images to extract high-order features and enhance the accuracy of risk prediction. Through empirical analysis of data from multiple asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and foreign exchange, the results show that the proposed CNN model significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness, especially under extreme market conditions. This research provides a new method for financial risk management, with important theoretical significance and practical value.",2024-12-04,
"Hidden Markov graphical models with state-dependent generalized
  hyperbolic distributions","In this paper we develop a novel hidden Markov graphical model to investigate time-varying interconnectedness between different financial markets. To identify conditional correlation structures under varying market conditions and accommodate stylized facts embedded in financial time series, we rely upon the generalized hyperbolic family of distributions with time-dependent parameters evolving according to a latent Markov chain. We exploit its location-scale mixture representation to build a penalized EM algorithm for estimating the state-specific sparse precision matrices by means of an $L_1$ penalty. The proposed approach leads to regime-specific conditional correlation graphs that allow us to identify different degrees of network connectivity of returns over time. The methodology's effectiveness is validated through simulation exercises under different scenarios. In the empirical analysis we apply our model to daily returns of a large set of market indexes, cryptocurrencies and commodity futures over the period 2017-2023.",2024-12-04,
Analysis of Export Barriers of Honey Pineapple Commodity in Purbalingga Regency,"Pineapple production is increasing globally due to the demand for the fruit in the food processing industry to the manufacture of snacks. Purbalingga Regency has not maximized this potential because some MSMEs have stopped and have never exported. This study aims to determine the factors inhibiting the export of honey pineapple commodities inPurbalingga Regency. The technique used was unstructured interviews with 6 resource persons, namely Nanas-qu, Almeidah, the Department of Industry and Trade (Disperindag), the Department of Cooperatives and SMEs (Diskopukm), the FTA Support Center, and export practitioners. The results showed that Honey pineapple MSMEs in Purbalingga Regency struggle to set competitive export prices due to inability to purchase canning machines, reliance on external services, high export costs, and limited negotiation abilities, resulting in low product competitiveness and high selling prices. MSMEs in Purbalingga Regency rely significantly on their own funds for canning machinery, which is insufficient to cover operating expenses. Financial recording constraints limit access to working capital credit programs. Sufficient operating capital is required for operations and annually certificate audits when exporting honey pineapple. Optimal cooperation between pineapple stakeholders and district governments must be done to increase Indonesian pineapple exports to global markets.",2024-12-04,
Development of Time Series Model to Predict Daily Gold Price,"Gold is ancient and one of the most precious and popular commodities in the world. Gold price forecasting is critical in financial decision-making, providing valuable information for investors in the gold market, sellers of gold items and stakeholders. Not much studies have been carried out in to forecast daily gold prices of Sri Lanka. The aim of this paper is to forecast the daily gold price rate (Rupees/troy ounce) using data from 2nd January 2018 to 14th June 2024 published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The best fitted model was identified as ARIMA (1,1,1) + ARCH (2). The model was trained using data from 2nd January 2018 to 31st May 2024 and validated using data from the 3rd of June 2024 to 14th of June 2024. The model was statistically tested using standard statistical procedure and errors were found as white noise. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for the training data set and validation data set were 0.748% and 1.002% respectively. The validation confirmed that the ARIMA (1,1,1) + ARCH (2) model effectively captures the dynamics of gold price movements, offering robust predictive power. These results indicate that the model is highly accurate and reliable for forecasting, making it a valuable tool for financial institutions and investors aiming to predict market trends and make informed investment decisions.

Food Financialization: Impact of Derivatives and Index Funds on Agri-Food Market Volatility,"This study explores the financialization of agricultural commodities, focusing on how financial derivatives and index funds impact the volatility of agro-food markets. Using a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) GARCH model, we analyze volatility spillovers among key agricultural commodities, particularly maize, and related financial assets over a sample period from 2007 to 2020. Our analysis includes major financial assets like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), the S&amp;P 500 index, and agribusiness corporations such as ADM and Bunge and the largest corn flour producer, GRUMA. The results indicate that financial speculation, especially via passive investments such as ETFs, has intensified price volatility in commodity futures, leading to a systemic risk increase within the sector. This study provides empirical evidence of increased market integration between the agro-food sector and financial markets, underscoring risks to food security and economic stability. We conclude with recommendations for regulatory actions to mitigate systemic risks posed by the growing financial influence in agricultural markets.",2024-12-03,
"Passport island: The market for EU citizenship in Cyprus By TheodorosRakopoulos. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2023. 262 pp.","All passports share similarities in appearance and in their purpose of facilitating international mobility. Despite their superficial commonalities, however, not all passports are created equal, and as this book shows, passports are often tools for the rich. The world's passports are subject to rankings; the wealthiest nations' passports allow visa-free access to about 200 countries, while the lowest-ranked ones (of poor and war-torn countries) offer far less access. One's citizenship, normally assigned by place of birth (jus solis) or one's blood ties (jus sanguinis), determines one's chance of acquiring a better or worse passport. As Passport Island shows, citizenship and passports are commodified such that the world's wealthiest people can acquire (in a sense ""buy"") citizenship and a higher-ranked passport (jus pecuniae), and they can thus acquire greater opportunities to move throughout the world for further investment and to hide and shelter their money. Passport Island raises fascinating questions about the shifting meanings and practices of global and national citizenship, social inequalities, and privilege. Anthropologists of migration have mainly focused on less privileged people who lack passports or meaningful citizenship, or who face passport and mobility problems, such as temporary or undocumented migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees. By contrast, Theodoros Rakopoulos examines a less studied and highly privileged side of the passport story. Chapter 1 highlights the importance of Cyprus's specific geoeconomic and political history, which fueled the commodification of citizenship as an economic solution and as a last-ditch effort to save the country from economic collapse. Chapter 2 continues the discussion of ""golden passports"" and their acquisition through the Citizen by Investment Program (CIP) by wealthy, privileged people from anywhere in the world who desired (or needed) a second passport, especially one that gave them EU access. The program was discontinued in October 2020, after a major corruption scandal in which the president was discovered to have planted his own ill-gotten golden-passport proceeds in an offshore account. Using extensive field research in the Republic of Cyprus, in the city of Limassol, where the CIP's impact is most visible in the form of its high-rise ""passport towers"" along the coastline, Rakopoulos introduces us in chapter 3 to the ""Makers,"" including local lawyers, brokers, and politicians, whom he meets and engages with in locations ranging from shiny modern office buildings to cafés. Many of them studied in Russian-speaking countries or spent time in the regions where their prospective clients come from. They introduce him to other colorful local characters and power brokers in the golden-passport industry. Rakopoulos is attentive and insightful about his interlocutors' language and diverse views, offering thoughtful interpretations of the varied and sometimes contradictory discourses that helped justify and promote the CIP. Chapter 4, ""Takers,"" introduces readers to members of Limassol's large Russophone population, numbering 44,000 out of the city's total population of 200,000. Many members of this community are involved in the CIP industry in some way, offering banking, financial, and other services. They are immigrants (some going back decades) who acquired citizenship in the normal way, by working and fulfilling longtime residency requirements, and as such, they have different opinions about the CIP. Both the Takers and the Makers provide intriguing images of the golden-passport holders (including their corruption and crimes), but they are most striking in their absence from Limassol, and from the real estate they have invested in, which mainly remains dark at night while they are presumably traveling elsewhere. The elite golden-passport holders remain shady and sketchy characters in the book and they do not speak for themselves. Most rarely reside in Cyprus, but sometimes they park their family members there under various circumstances. Nonetheless, there are fascinating tales of disreputable characters from various continents, including a Chinese businessman who changed his mind about investing in a building after consulting a feng shui app. The wider global economy of passports and CIPs is the topic of ""Markets"" (chap. 5). This far-reaching chapter addresses the book's argument ""that citizenship by investment is a national product addressing the global offshoring market regime"" (p. 190). It discusses the ever-changing list of countries offering CIPs, their passport rankings (correlated with the ""cost"" of investment and the investor's freedom of mobility), and the various benefits they offer to wealthy clients who seek to relocate or hide and protect their businesses or financial capital, themselves, or their family members. Options include small island countries of the Caribbean; small EU countries, such as Malta and Montenegro; and countries with low passport value, such as Turkey, Egypt, Vanuatu, and Comoros. The required investments vary greatly, as do the additional fees and required ""donations"" and the potential benefits. Some locations are, for example, better suited for relocating families, for people to disappear, or to serve as tax shelters. Some of the author's most fascinating examples are the UAE, Kuwait, and Dubai, where the emirates refuse to grant citizenship to the local domestic population. Instead, they ""offshore them"" by ""purchasing"" citizenship and passports for them from the poor island of Comoros, in the Indian Ocean (pp. 206–7). Passport Island closely examines the specific context in which golden passports came to be produced and brokered in Cyprus, and how they were understood and rationalized in the industry and by politicians, by the local Russian community, and to some degree by ""ordinary"" locals. Theoretically, the book is informed by a wide range of literature in political and economic anthropology, including Marx and Polanyi. Echoing arguments about the commodification of intimacy, the author refers to the purchase of citizenship as ""Polanyi's nightmare,"" in which things are commodified that should not be. The author engages with an array of scholarship about the state, global citizenship, and the political economics of the EU and Cyprus. He is highly attuned to various local arguments about the CIP and the golden passports. For example, advocates claimed that the program showed their lack of racism, since they welcomed anyone as citizens, regardless of their skin color. Critics respond to the program's purported color-blindness, pointing out that regardless of one's color, if they are poor and in need, they are indeed ignored equally. The book's key premise is that ""national citizenship correlates with and exacerbates global inequality"" (p. 10). Yet the author aims to steer a path between those who applaud golden passports to alleviate the inequality of the birthright lottery and those who criticize them as a threat to citizenship and as morally wrong. Instead, he proposes a more dialectical view of golden passports as a solution to ""the problem they partly create: financially escaping political restrictions"" (p. 41). A central theme involves the connection of CIPs to older forms of ""offshoring."" Brokers specialize in advising would-be customers on which CIPs would work best for them, depending on their needs and their finances. While some critics point to the criminality and corruption of this system, others see it as a pragmatic, positive, and even utopian approach to global citizenship. The author highlights the impact of the CIP on the Maker and Taker communities. But what about ""ordinary"" people who are not part of those two groups? While no book can cover everything, the focus on inequality and on the effect of the golden-passport program on the local community would benefit from a diversity of views from this community. Ultimately, we learn only briefly in the conclusion about the specific impacts on people not in the Makers or Takers category, an anti-golden-passport protest, the environmental impact of the passport towers, and the rent increases for locals. Including voices that speak directly to these issues might also diversify the predominantly ""masculine"" voices of the golden-passport program. One of the most interesting and provocative parts of the argument is Rakopoulos's engagement with Keshavarz's (2018) work on the market for forged passports as a means of addressing global inequalities of mobility. Addressing inequalities and economic globalization, Rakopoulos reflects on the ethical and practical implications of the purchase of golden passports and that of forgeries by otherwise immobile people who seek to migrate. Both reflect the globalization of citizenship, the commodification of passports, and a lack of commitment to a state. Overall, Passport Island makes critically important contributions to debates on the relationship between global and national citizenship, and between capitalism and the state, when citizenship becomes (or is reduced to) a mere commodity without connections or commitments to a community. The citizenship-by-investment scheme in Cyprus is fascinating alone. It gains even greater significance from the discussion of citizenship by investment offered by other countries, and the more subtle but related patterns of ""residence by investment"" with ""golden visas"" in other regions. This book should be of special interest to anthropologists interested in political and economic anthropology, citizenship, and migration. Anthropologists interested in the brokerage of citizenship in relation to the EU and to globalization more broadly will find this book especially compelling.",2024-12-03,
The Endowment Effect in a Field Study with Risk-Reducing Instruments,"The endowment effect is a phenomenon whereby ownership increases the perceived value of goods, thereby reducing the willingness to trade. This paper presents the results of a field experiment, designed to assess the robustness of this effect when decisions concern unique, non-tangible instruments of a very high utility. Participating students were unaware of being involved in the experiment, as we monitored their decisions concerning the examination bonuses in a natural academic setting. In contrast to the majority of prior studies that focus on commodities of a known and certain value, this research examines the effect in the context of risky and ambiguous instruments, which are more difficult to evaluate. Our results strongly support the endowment effect hypothesis, proving that the effect is robust, and likely to also be observed in markets concerning high-utility, risky instruments, such as financial ones. Additionally, we find a weak level of support for the gender effect, with female respondents demonstrating a lack of bias when endowed with ambiguous instruments. The study also analyzes the efficiency of these instruments in terms of their utility in risk reduction, and the effort incentives created.",2024-12-03,
"The Entrepreneurial Mindset: Views and Perspectives of Cacao Entrepreneurs on Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Bicol Region, Philippines","Innovation and entrepreneurship are fundamental drivers of economic growth. Oftentimes, sustainable development is equated with these two indices where untapped potential and emerging industries are available that present countless opportunities for the people. A research study was conducted composed of cacao farmers, farmers/processors and farmers/processors/traders residing in various towns in the Bicol region, Philippines aimed at determining their perception, innovation and entrepreneurial initiatives and strategies. A survey-questionnaire was designed and administered to 70 cacao farmers and entrepreneurs and qualitative data analysis techniques, such as thematic coding and content analysis was employed to analyze result of the interview and focus group discussions. Findings of the study showed that farming is the primary focus for the majority of respondents (67%), with only a minority involved in processing or trading activities. The most highly recommended innovative cacao-based products with potential market success are primarily in the food and confectionery categories, with substantial interest in beverages and skincare products. Ninety-one percent (91%) are willing to pay a premium for innovative cacao products because they value supporting local entrepreneurship and a good sign of a strong community support for local businesses with high level of willingness to invest in locally developed products. Job creation and empowerment of small-scale farmers are considered as top benefits of a community-based value-added cacao products enterprise. Limited financial investment/capital is the most significant problem faced, followed closely by unstable demand and low and unregulated farm gate price of agricultural commodities.",2024-12-02,
Using AI Technology to Enhance Data‐Driven Decision‐Making in the Financial Sector,"The finance industry has seen a rapid transformation with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), which makes data analysis, modeling, and decision-making more effective and efficient. Artificial intelligence technology allows the financial sector to process massive datasets, identify complex patterns, and generate predictive insights that previously were unattainable through traditional analytics methods. This chapter begins with an overview of AI technology widely used in the financial industry. Three case studies in the agricultural sector, the new energy sector, and the commodity sector are presented, which discusses how AI technology helps farmers, entrepreneurs, marketers, and other financial practitioners. The first case examines the effects of remote-sensing images to forecast crop price trends.

Energy Price Impact on BRIC Stock Markets: A Granger Causality Analysis,"Energy prices and the stock market are two of the crucial factors in the evolving landscape of global finance, particularly in major emerging economies. However, research on how energy price changes impact stock markets in BRIC countries remains limited, despite their diverse roles in global energy markets and economies. This study investigates the causal dynamics between energy prices and stock market performance in BRIC countries, aiming to uncover short-term fluctuations and long-run relationships in these major emerging economies. Utilizing daily data from 2013 to 2023, stationarity tests, cointegration analysis, and Granger causality tests are employed to examine these relationships. Key findings reveal weak evidence of a long-run equilibrium between energy prices and stock market indices, challenging previous assumptions about their cointegration. More significantly, the findings uncovered a strong unidirectional Granger causality from oil prices to all BRIC stock market indices, while gas prices show a more selective influence. Notably, no evidence of reverse causality from stock markets to energy prices was found, highlighting the exogenous nature of global energy prices in relation to BRIC stock markets. This study uniquely analyzes oil and gas price effects on BRIC stock markets, offering insights for investors and policymakers amid increasing commodity-financial market integration.

Community Forestry as Livelihood Assets: Household Perspectives and Sustainable Practices,"Abstract Community forestry (CF) has provided significant benefits to communities and maintained forest sustainability. This study aims to analyze the level of community dependence on the Community Forestry area and identify livelihood assets based on five capitals: human capital, natural capital, financial capital, physical capital, and social capital, as well as sustainable livelihood strategies. This study uses the method of analyzing the level of dependency using the contribution formula and livelihood analysis. The results showed that the level of community dependence on the CF permit area in a year was 36%, while from outside CF management, it was 64%. This shows that the community manages more commodities from outside the CF area than within the CF area because the market price demand for products from outside the CF area, such as corn and rice, is more stable and higher, which affects their income. In addition, many commodities that have just begun to be developed by the community have not yet provided significant economic benefits. The most influential capital in encouraging people to obtain a decent livelihood is physical capital, which is supported by several categories such as housing conditions, means of transport, access to communication tools, road access, and public assets. Meanwhile, human capital, natural capital, social capital, and financial capital are in the medium category. These four capitals synergize with each other through community skills supported by good cooperation among farmer groups, as well as the availability of natural resources that can be managed to fulfill daily needs. Sustainable livelihood strategies adopted by the community include intensification and extension, diversification, and migration. This research provides an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of community dependence on community forestry and the various livelihood strategies they use to achieve economic and environmental sustainability.",2024-12-01,
"Potential budgetary impacts of climate change on the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage insurance plan","More frequent and severe weather events are projected with climate change. The U.S. Federal Government offers programs to help producers mitigate the financial impacts of these adverse events, the largest of which is the USDA, Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP). The potential impacts on FCIP outlays under future climate scenarios have been explored but most analyses have focused on impacts on field crops. A changing climate could also affect forage commodities and livestock producers. The Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage (PRF) insurance plan was designed to help producers mitigate financial losses associated with a lack of precipitation. Payments are triggered if precipitation is below a historical index. Payment amounts are determined by the decrease in precipitation, changes in biomass value, and participation in the program. This report provides projected changes to precipitation(using climate estimates), biomass (using a livestock rangeland model), and future participation in the program. Results show that net payments (defined as indemnities, plus premium subsidies, minus total premiums) are projected to range from an annual average of approximately $495 million per year to$2.63 billion per year between 2024 and 2050 compared to the average net payments of $603 million per year (in 2024 terms) observed in 2020–23",2024-12-01,
The Transformation of Interest Prohibition,"This study aimed to explore the transformation of the concept of riba (usury) within contemporary financial systems, specifically how Islamic jurisprudence has adapted to modern economic practices. The analysis also aimed to understand the evolving interpretation of riba and its implications for Islamic and global financial markets. A comparative analysis was adopted, integrating qualitative methods such as document analysis and a case study of financial systems. This study examined historical and modern interpretations of riba, with a specific focus on the transition from traditional gold and silver standards to fiat money systems. The results showed that the adaptation of riba in modern financial systems required significant transformation, particularly in response to the transition from commodity-based to fiat money. The analysis identified key trends in how riba was reinterpreted within the context of contemporary financial systems as well as discussed the challenges and solutions proposed by Islamic scholars. Additionally, it contributed to the existing body of knowledge by providing a nuanced analysis of how the prohibition of riba was applied in contemporary financial systems, connecting historical perspectives with modern practices. The analysis provided new insights into the dynamic relationship between traditional Islamic financial principles and the evolving global financial landscape. It also showed the importance of continuous investigation of riba in the context of contemporary financial systems. This study suggested that ongoing discourse among Islamic financial practitioners and scholars was crucial for developing solutions to support both traditional principles and contemporary financial realities.",2024-12-01,
PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL REGULATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE BUSINESS IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY,"Purpose. The aim of the article is to summarize the institutional tools for regulating innovation dynamics and to study practical aspects of institutional support for the development of innovative business. Methodology of research. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study is the institutional approach to substantiating the instruments of regulation of the development of innovative business in the national economy; the evolutionary approach is used to generalize the elements of the institutional design of formal norms of influence on innovation dynamics; system approach ‒ to substantiate the mechanism of formation of institutional support for the development of innovative business. Findings. It is stated that the key problem for the development of innovative business in the national economy is its institutional insecurity. It is manifested in the contradictions and archaic nature of the innovation process model, the difficulties of fiscal administration of the results of innovation activity, the low investment activity of commodity producers and the evolutionary and institutional limitations of innovation dynamics. Emphasis is placed on the importance of the reconstruction of the existing institutional support for innovative development and the design of intermediate institutional forms to promote the development of innovation in the national economy. It is argued that institutional design is able to weaken institutional and evolutionary constraints that restrain the formation of effective institutions. A correlation has been established between innovative activity, financial results and the dominance of own sources of financing for innovative activity and the implementation of innovations. Originality. The theoretical and methodological substantiation for the formation of an effective economic institution have been further developed by determining a promising trajectory for its construction, which proceeds from resource, technological and institutional constraints and includes built-in mechanisms and tools that stimulate planned changes in institutions, which, unlike existing approaches, allows minimizing the occurrence of dysfunctions and institutional traps. Proposals for the formation of optimal intermediate forms of the innovation institute have been further developed through the implementation of: monitoring the institutional space (analysis of basic, economized, managerial, specialized institutions and institutes); assessment of institutional and evolutionary constraints (resources, technologies, human capital, social relations, expectations, cultural environment, political influence, complementarity of institutions and sequence of reforms); formation of favourable expectations from institutional reforms; introduction of instruments to stimulate innovative growth. Practical value. The obtained results of the research can be used to conduct further scientific research on improving the institutional support for the development of innovative business.

"Inflation Dynamics in Tanzania: An Exploratory Review of Reforms, Trends and Challenges","Abstract This study explores the inflation dynamics in Tanzania, analyzing the interaction of government policies, domestic factors, and external shock over the past five decades. While the existing literature has examined particular inflation dimensions, a holistic inflation picture is lacking, which this study aims to provide. Through rigorous documentation and review performed quantitatively and qualitatively, inflation trends, the effect of major policy reforms, and inflation management challenges are examined. The findings indicate that inflation has varied considerably with times of high volatility juxtaposed with times of relative stability. Market reforms such as fiscal and trade reforms have strengthened macroeconomic stability and recently contained inflationary pressures. However, structural bottlenecks such as a narrow tax base, low financial inclusion, dominant informal sector and limited institutional capacity persist and confront the effective management of inflation. Global commodity price volatility, the effect of climate change, and political events further exert pressure on prices. Policymakers need to tackle the challenges of inflation management and price stability effectively and holistically. Widening the tax base, improving financial inclusion, strengthening institutions, economic diversification, and reducing the effect of climate change, coupled with the sustainable improvement of macroeconomic management, are the major steps to improve living standards and foster Tanzania’s growth.",2024-12-01,
Volgograd Region Potential in Implementation of Import Substitution Policy and Agricultural Exports Strengthening: Need to Improve Government Support,"The diversification of foreign economic relations adjusted the approaches of government in terms of clarification of strategic priorities of agriculture, synchronizing them in accordance with the national goals of the country. The analysis of the factors that determined the new conditions for the activities of farmers showed the increased attention to improvement of the system of state support for the industry. Import substitution opportunities act as a vector for the development of the agrarian economy, aimed not only at growth stimulation of domestic agricultural production, but also increasing export potential. The study of self-sufficiency indicators revealed spot problems in the implementation of import substitution policy (breeding, seed production, genetic material) that require a systematic approach in the context of government support. The priority of the development of dairy cattle breeding is the basic condition for self-sufficiency achievement in milk and dairy products. Statistical data made it possible to assess the current state of development of dairy cattle breeding. The article systematizes measures of government support, examines the potential of Volgograd region in the context of problems’ solution of this area. The study also identifies the problems of breeding and seed production development. The conclusion is made about the need to transform the system of government support for agriculture on the basis of a mechanism made of three elements, which are the interaction between the state, agricultural universities or research institutes and farmers themselves. The task of the government is to respond in a modern way to changes in the conditions of activity of farmers, stability of provision and expansion of financial support measures, mainly targeted financing, adoption and adjustment of relevant legislation. The conclusion is made about the possibility of expanding the boundaries of domestic agricultural production with an emphasis on the export-oriented component, changing export flows from the position of commodity and geographical structure.",2024-12-01,
Risk Management Analysis in Snake Fruit Supply Chain through House of Risk Approaches (Case study in CV “MT”),"Snake fruit is a native Indonesian fruit that has become one of the leading export horticultural commodities. However, the distribution process of snake fruit exports to foreign countries faces several risks, such as perishability, bulky, diverse quality, and seasonality. Therefore, qualified management of risk barriers in the snake fruit supply chain system is needed, which is not only found in the distribution process but also in the production process and financial risks to maintain the quality of snake fruit. This study aims to identify potential risks, analyze the level of risk, and formulate risk mitigation measures in the snake fruit supply chain. The research method uses the intrinsic case study method and is analyzed using the House of Risk approach. The results showed that there were 32 risk events and 33 risk agents. Two of them are priority risks for mitigation, namely the risk of natural factors and demand fluctuations, which have led to 3 recommendations for mitigation actions, consisting of collaborating with related agencies and institutions, conducting intense communication among supply chain actors, and providing counselling and supervision of farmer-level snake fruit cultivation activities.",2024-11-30,

"Combining density forecast accuracy tests: an application to agricultural, energy, and metal commodities","Abstract This study develops a new methodology for combining density forecast accuracy tests and assessing the relevance of psychological indicators in predicting commodity returns. Density forecasts provide a complete description of the uncertainty associated with a prediction and are highly requested by policymakers, central bankers, and financial operators to define policy actions, manage financial risks, and assess portfolio selection. The proposed methodology combines different tests and derives the p-value of the resulting test statistic by Monte Carlo simulations. To assess the power of the proposed methodology, we implement a set of experiments for several data-generating processes. Based on an empirical forecasting exercise applied to agricultural, energy, and metal commodities, we find that sentiment variables and psychological factors improve the density forecasts of commodity futures returns, especially for agricultural commodities. Additionally, combinations of sentiment variables are more powerful in predicting returns than considering them separately.",2024-11-29,

Transition of Crypto Asset Supervision From Bappebti to OJK,"This article discusses the impact of rapid technological advancements in information and communication on the financial system, particularly the shift from cash-based transactions to non-cash payment methods and the emergence of cryptocurrencies. The increased adoption of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlights the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure investor protection and financial stability. This study focuses on the role of Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) in regulating cryptocurrencies, especially following the enactment of Law No. 4 of 2023, which mandates OJK’s involvement in overseeing these digital assets. The research utilizes a normative legal approach, leveraging a literature review to gather relevant literature, regulations, and legal frameworks on cryptocurrency management. Key findings reveal the existence of a dual regulatory framework involving both OJK and the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti), which may lead to potential conflicts and challenges in supervision. This article aims to provide recommendations for regulatory harmonization between OJK and Bappebti to enhance regulatory effectiveness and protect investors in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Through this analysis, the study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the regulatory challenges faced by cryptocurrencies and propose policy solutions that can strengthen OJK’s role in this sector..",2024-11-29,
Time-Varying Spillover Effects of Carbon Prices on China’s Financial Risks,"As China’s financial markets become increasingly integrated and the carbon market undergoes financialization, the impact of carbon emission price fluctuations on financial markets has emerged as a key area of systemic risk research. This study employs the Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and the optimal Copula function to investigate the dynamic correlation between carbon prices and China’s financial markets. Building on this, the Monte Carlo simulation and Copula CoVaR models are used to explore the spillover effects of carbon price volatility on China’s financial markets. The findings reveal the following: (1) Carbon price fluctuations generate spillover effects on all financial markets, but the intensity varies across different markets. The foreign exchange market experiences the strongest spillover effect, followed by the bond market, while the stock and money markets are relatively less affected. (2) The optimal Copula functions differ between the carbon market and China’s financial markets, indicating heterogeneous characteristics across regional markets. (3) There is a degree of interdependence between the carbon market and various sub-markets in China’s financial system. The carbon market has the strongest positive correlation with the commodity market and a relatively high negative correlation with the real estate market. These findings underscore the importance of integrating carbon price volatility into financial risk management frameworks. For policymakers, it highlights the need to consider market stability measures when crafting carbon emission regulations. Market managers can leverage these insights to develop strategies that mitigate risk spillover effects, while investors can use this analysis to inform their portfolio diversification and risk assessment processes.",2024-11-28,
Derivatives markets fragilities and the energy transition,"Abstract It is common knowledge that climate change concerns have prompted countries around the world to plan for a reduction in their fossil fuel dependencies. Yet while much attention has been placed on new low‐carbon sources of energy such as wind, solar, and nuclear, comparatively little focus has centered on the commodity inputs, critical metals, needed to create this clean energy. In this article, we argue that at the heart of the energy transition is a commodities transition, representing an unprecedented international reliance on critical metals, which have traditionally been capricious commodities traded in global markets. Indeed, nations around the world have begun to stockpile these geographically concentrated, geopolitically potent materials which are poised to take center stage. This critical commodities transition accompanying the energy transition is underappreciated in the legal scholarship despite its widespread implications for many areas, including financial regulation. We use the story of the London Metal Exchange's March 2022 nickel debacle to turn a spotlight on this development and to highlight several areas of existing regulatory frameworks in derivatives markets that are ripe for reexamination given this commodities evolution. In doing so, this article sets the stage for a research agenda that will examine how regulators and financial innovators can build strong metal markets to enable secure metals supply chains and to provide the basis for a sustainable energy transition.",2024-11-28,
Strategic monitoring of the investment policy of food enterprises in ukraine,"The article is devoted to the issues of investment policy and strategic monitoring of food enterprises in Ukraine. The study aims to improve the strategic monitoring process of the investment policy of food enterprises, which allows for assessing the effectiveness of investment decisions and the impact of innovative technologies on enterprise development in the context of globalization and competition. The article examines current trends in developing Ukraine’s food industry, particularly its investment support, and role in ensuring its food security. The dynamics of research expenditures in the food sector, including the food industry, are analyzed. A low level of investment in research and development has been identified as a key restraining factor in the innovative development of the industry. In particular, despite some positive changes in funding for scientific research, expenditures on research remain insignificant compared to the overall needs of the food industry. It has been determined that, under martial law, food enterprises in Ukraine operate in an unstable economic environment characterized by the instability of investment, financial, and commodity markets. The study identified the main challenges faced by enterprises in implementing investment strategies. The study substantiates the role of strategic monitoring as an effective tool for assessing the investment environment, which enables identifying promising development directions and adapting enterprises to changing market conditions. The study proposes the key components of the strategic monitoring process, which include analyzing the investment climate, studying investment structures, assessing the level of innovation activity, evaluating the effectiveness of state policies in stimulating investment in the food industry, and formulating recommendations for improving the investment policy of food enterprises. Implementing the proposed strategic monitoring process for investment policy will allow food enterprises to promptly identify factors limiting their development and develop specific strategies to enhance innovation activity, improve access to financial resources, optimize state support, and reduce investment barriers.

COTTON FARMERS' PERCEIVED RISK AND INCOME VARIABILITY AFFECTED BY COMMODITY DERIVATIVE MARKETS: A CASE STUDY ON ODISHA (INDIA),"Agricultural production, particularly cotton farming, is highly vulnerable to fluctuating commodity prices and unpredictable weather, making risk mitigation crucial for sustainability and profitability. Cotton growers face market volatility and climate challenges that impact yields and income. Previous studies, such as Sharma &amp; Bhushan (2019), highlighted the correlation between market instability and income fluctuation for smallholder cotton farmers, emphasizing improved risk management strategies. The quantitative study used data from 1000 cotton farmers from Odisha (India), selected via stratified random sampling to capture demographic diversity. A structured questionnaire was employed to gather information on key variables, with electronic distribution increasing accessibility. While the research provides. valuable insights, its cross-sectional design limits causal conclusions, and reliance on self-reported information may introduce bias and utilize SPSS to perform structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand the relationships between farmers' perceived risk, income variability, and the use of commodity derivatives. The result shows the negligible effect of commodity derivatives on the revenue stability of cotton growers, except for input costs. The varied risk assessments of farmers indicate that essential financial aspects are overlooked.",2024-11-27,
Fin-ALICE: Artificial Linguistic Intelligence Causal Econometrics,"This study introduces Fin-ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Intelligence Causal Econometrics), a framework designed to forecast financial time series by integrating multiple analytical approaches including co-occurrence networks, supply chain analysis, and emotional sentiment analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. In our co-occurrence analysis, we focus on companies that share the same emotion on the same day, using a much shorter horizon than our previous study of one month. This approach allows us to uncover short-term, emotion-driven correlations that traditional models might overlook. By analyzing these co-occurrence networks, Fin-ALICE identifies hidden connections between companies, sectors, and events. Supply chain analysis within Fin-ALICE will evaluate significant events in commodity-producing countries that impact their ability to supply key resources. This analysis captures the ripple effects of disruptions across industries and regions, offering a more nuanced prediction of market movements. Emotional sentiment analysis, powered by the Fin-Emotion library developed in our prior research, quantifies the emotional undertones in financial news through metrics like “emotion magnitude” and “emotion interaction”. These insights, when integrated with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), significantly enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts by capturing the emotional drivers of market sentiment. Key contributions of Fin-ALICE include its ability to perform month-by-month company correlation analysis, capturing short-term market fluctuations and seasonal patterns. We compare the performance of TCNs against advanced models such as LLMs and LSTMs, demonstrating that the Fin-ALICE model outperforms these models, particularly in sectors where emotional sentiment and supply chain dynamics are critical. Fin-ALICE provides decision-makers with predictive insights and a deeper understanding of the underlying emotional and supply chain factors that drive market behaviors.",2024-11-26,
Constructions of Luxury in Digital Visual Culture,"Introduction Luxury is a contextual notion that evades a single definition and is generally connected to the socio-historical and socio-cultural discourses in which it develops (Ko et al.). As such, what is considered as luxury can be a very subjective experience, and emerges as a “consumer- and culture-dependent construct” (Turunen, 105). The twentieth century witnessed an incredible revolution, as far as the idea of luxury was concerned. While luxury had historically been the domain of the wealthy, consumer capitalist imperatives created stratified and democratised notions of luxury, with different types of corresponding products created to meet the needs of different consumers; this made luxury ‘accessible’ for all (Chevalier and Mazzalovo). In the twenty-first century, luxury has also been undergoing a process of digital re-definition, in terms not only of how to own it, but also of what it means to own it for identity and display (Tungate). In our contemporary landscape, luxury has evolved into a multi-faceted concept, which moulds and adapts to circumstance and experience: it is built upon intersecting notions of innovation and tradition, accessibility and excess, individuality and collectivity, authenticity and artificiality. As the perception of luxury, especially in a media context, relies on a multisensory experience, the contemporary marketing of luxury goods often employs design elements that “boost perceived luxuriousness” (Turunen, 105). In order to achieve this, simplicity and pleasurable aesthetics are commonly merged with extravagance and over-the-top iconography. As Calefato suggests, “luxury is an aesthetic, economic and cultural model” that seeks to “explain and justify degrees of possession, forms of consumption, and features of taste” (12). Contemporary notions of luxury, whether connected to cars, clothes, accessories, food, or other goods—including holiday experiences—pursue spheres of exceptionality, opulence, and uniqueness, as well as more immaterial socio-cultural ideas of well-being and ‘satisfaction’. The construction of a luxury brand relies first and foremost on the “perception that consumers hold of brands” in general (Romaniuk and Huang, 547). Storytelling is a very important part of constructing luxury brands (Atkinson and Kang). A ‘brand story’ is often an artificial construction of suggested experiences and multiple multisensorial codes—visual and beyond—that are assimilated by consumers as being the foundations of luxury. In the twenty-first century, luxury has become intrinsically more connected to notions of display that are inseparable from online platforms and social media in particular. Therefore, there exists a need to reinvestigate the idea of luxury and its dissemination in today’s digital world. Taking this notion as a point of departure, this article provides a preliminary exploration of the construction of luxury in visual culture—with a focus on social media platforms such as Instagram—as connected to culturally informed projections of desirability and aspirational value. This inevitably raises questions over the artificial nature of curated online personas via practices of visual and digital storytelling, especially as projected ideas of luxuriousness become the focus of attention. Visual Culture and the Realms of Luxury As the term openly suggests, ‘visual culture’ refers to specific examples of our cultural expression that rely on images as a means of communication (Dikovitskaya). Visual culture is a very broad term that encompasses forms of narrative and expression that touch on different aspects of life. The most prominent exponents of the visual culture umbrella have historically been art, fashion, photography, film, television, comics, and advertising. More recently, examples such as video games and social media have also joined the visual culture family, and aided the development of what has become known as ‘digital visual culture’: an area drawing attention to the intersection of digital media, technology, and the visual arts (Bentowska-Kafel and Gardiner; Knochel). Although visual culture emphasises images, it is also important to recognise the interplay between images and words—the latter also known as ‘copy’—as a foundational way to communicate meaning and ideas. This is particularly evident in examples of visual culture such as advertising, where the play between words and image is often essential for rendering the message. Within this, one can see how the representation and communication of luxury is profoundly entangled with the broader aspects of visual culture (Armitage; Sikarskie). The ‘meaning’ of images is not universal; while many may recognise what something is just by looking at it, its ‘meaning’—what it represents, what it stands for, and how it will ‘speak’ to ‘people’—will change according to context and situation (Howells and Negreiros). Decoding the meaning of visual images will be dependent on a number of evolving factors, including gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, historical and geopolitical context The contextual nature of visual images already creates a clear conceptual affinity with the idea of luxury, which is dependent on perceptions, projection, and cultural construction. The terms ‘visual’ and ‘luxury’ are profoundly entangled, and operate in similar and interconnected ways. The very concept of luxury is dependent on representations of value and experience that change historically, culturally, socially, and economically. Discussing the decoding of luxury images, Armitage suggests that meaning is relative to and dependent upon structures of the visual connected with forms of cultural life, such as making a painting or the indulgence of eyeing a Cartier watch ... . Visual terms and discourses are never unbiased but are bound to cultural systems of understanding, practices and routines. (7) The great majority of luxury brands rely on particular aesthetic representations and significant visual images that communicate the experience, value, and importance of the item in question. The interpretation that is necessary for any visual product is also at the core of our understanding of luxury. As such, both are negotiable, contestable, evaluative, and subject to fellow agreement. “The powerful meanings of luxury”, as Armitage puts it, are based on the significant impact of the visual: not only is visual culture significant for the comprehension and direction of luxury”, but our conceptions of the visual are caught up and inherent in today’s luxury discourses and practices. (8) Therefore, to consider luxury is to interpret its visual narratives. Those narratives are inevitably entangled with culture and lifestyle. The construction of luxury is based on both ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ attributes and ideas that are promoted to potential consumers in many ways. The interaction between ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ luxury—and the emergence of the two, as the final ‘product’—is what is known as the three “realms of luxury” (Roberts and Armitage, 1). The ‘first realm’ of luxury refers to the tangible object or place that exists in the world: what the item of luxury is, where it is located, where it is sold, and so forth. The ‘second realm’ of luxury refers to all the imaginary connections and evocations that are rendered in order to conceptualise the experience of luxury—feelings, aspirations, daydreaming, and associations with ideas of worth and value (Roberts and Armitage). Finally, the ‘third realm’ of luxury refers to the interaction of the first two, so that luxury itself—or the conception thereof, in context—is a mixture of both ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ characteristics; that is, in simple terms, the ‘full package’ of how the luxury item works, both materially and immaterially (Roberts and Armitage). The third realm of luxury is connected to ideas of authenticity, which are often tacitly communicated through specific socio-culturally inscribed codes. Luxury in the third realm exists through the construction of images and narratives that can be sold as both desirable and achievable, and offers brands “the opportunity to leverage consumers’ imaginations to extend the demand for luxury goods and services” (Roberts and Armitage, 2). At the heart of capturing the third realm of luxury, and therefore of harnessing the imagination of the potential consumer, lies visual culture: all the strategies of image and meaning representations that populate our cultural everyday. The third realm of luxury is commodified according to different ‘types’ of luxury consumers, including different socio-economic possibilities and backgrounds (Roberts and Armitage). The third realm of luxury is the realm of narrative, where luxury businesses and brands construct the desire to own and experience for the consumers, by blending real objects with imaginary spaces (Brody). The third realm is, arguably, more than anything else, the realm of advertising and marketing. Every time luxury is represented and rendered, it brings with it artificially-coded constructions of objects and experiences and inevitably creates ‘categories’ of people (Wang et al.). As notions of luxury are intrinsically connected to identity, by representing luxury we are also representing how people see themselves, and how they want to be seen by others. Digital Luxuries and Fashioning the Self The relationship between luxury items and luxury consumers in our contemporary twenty-first century context must be understood as being an interplay not only of product and quality, but also of identity-building and methods of proliferation, including the uses of digital technologies. It is important to bear in mind that, as Kluge contends, the marketing of luxury goods is potentially built on a paradox: “the more desirable the brand becomes, the more it sells, but the more it sells, the less desirable it becomes” (Kluge, 1). The preoccupation between sales growth and exclusiveness is mirrored in the ongoing debates on whether the Internet is a suitable medium for the sales and proliferation of luxury goods. On the surface, “a luxury brand’s fragile concept of exclusiveness is seemingly incompatible with the ubiquitous accessibility provided by the mass medium internet” (Kluge, 2). This worry is often known as the “Internet dilemma” of luxury brands and goods. That superficial notion, however, is not met with the outcomes of practice. There is ample evidence to say that the Internet—and the various platforms it affords—has become “imperative to luxury marketers” (Kluge, 2). In terms of actual buying, Websites have become a primary source of purchases for luxury goods. In the twenty-first century, where ‘quickness’, accessibility, choice—and a general cultural dislike for in-person interaction—have emerged as significant factors, the Website allows luxury goods shoppers to make their purchases in the most efficient of ways. As Kluge puts it: “to the affluent clientele”, the opportunity to shop online has become “the second most important feature of a luxury brand website”, with the most important feature being “product browsing” (2). While accessibility and greater (often global) reach are definitely significant advantages of online platforms and technologies, the digital context still creates a unique set of constraints for the development of luxury experiences. An obvious facet is the disappearance of the physical aspect of the luxury shop location, where the tangible experience of luxury goods (feel, smell, etc.) is inevitably removed from the buying process (Khan et al.). The material aspects of an object—which often define the luxuriousness value of products—highly contribute to the luxury brand being perceived as more authentic (Goldstein and Carpenter). Therefore, the intangible and physically elusive nature of digital interfaces bestows upon the online luxury buying experience a distinct level of artificiality. If the experience of physical ‘craftsmanship’ is part of how the luxury brands sells, then the digital frameworks may appear far removed from it (Lin and Ku). Nonetheless, while digital luxury experiences are obviously different from their more traditional, offline counterparts, they still rely on their own constructed notions to communicate the idea of exclusivity (Hennings and Wiedmann). The digital context primarily depends on the exploitation of pleasurable images, and the employment of active storytelling around the luxury goods: both from the brand itself and from those who have already purchased it, if one considers the context of social media in particular. The platforms that present luxury goods (from Websites to social media) must provide high production values—high-quality images, striking colours, clear definition, and so forth—as this is an expectation of the association with luxury. Phrases like “luxury webosphere” have been coined to refer to specifically constructed digital contexts that facilitate the buying process for luxury goods (Batat, 4). Indeed, the social media context is particularly privileged as the ideal space for the continuous sharing and evocation of luxury images. As Batat argues, “because social media increase the visibility of perceived luxurious images”, the luxury experiences derived from online services have highlighted even more greatly “the role of luxury products in conspicuous consumption” (xiv). Conspicuous consumption refers to the acquisition of goods and services for the specific purpose of displaying one’s wealth and/or shaping one’s social status. The employment of digital technologies has entailed a ‘digital transformation’ for luxury brands in the twenty-first century, where the experience of pleasurable images—and the ability to ‘share’ them—lies at the centre of the luxury experience itself. A notable shift has taken place, where luxury brands have capitalised on different sectors of online spaces, with different tastes and financial abilities in mind, to cater to different consumers at the same time (Elgebali and Zaazou). New strategies, with different uses of digital assets—from Websites to social media platforms—have had to be developed to meet the needs of a changing market. As von Wachenfeld suggests, the luxury market has truly been “mediatized in both its production and consumption”, from fashion shows to the retailing of particular items, through “digital practices of the fashioning of the self” (100). While there are many ways in which luxury has capitalised on a variety of online media, including the presence of visually stunning Websites, social media platforms arguably provide the most evocative visual representation of luxury (Bonilla-Quijada et al.). As such, social media are also a fruitful conduit for the third realm of luxury. Indeed, social media are the ideal advertising and marketing venue for luxury, both overtly (as in actual adverts) and covertly (through the sharing of users’ experiences). Social media platforms such as Instagram, in particular, provide a particular view on ‘digital luxuries’ and their sitting in the third realm. Social media highlight the importance of ‘pleasurable images’ in constructing ideas of luxury, both real and imagined, and connected to evocations of both material and immaterial aspects. As Roberts and Armitage put it, digital luxury involves an imaginary element of relevance, ... [which exposes] how the interaction between real places of luxury such as retail stores can promote imaginary luxury, and how imaginary luxury, including that simulated by digital technologies, influences the real places of luxury. (2) The example of Instagram is especially useful here, as although this platform arguably relies on images in the form of both stills and reels it also draws strength from the narrative that accompanies them to personalise objects and experiences in a perceived tangible way. Recently, digital media have been at the centre of re-imaginations and re-constructions not only of what luxury ‘is’, but also of how it is marketed at different moments in time (Kumar). Like other social media platforms, Instagram has enabled its users to document their personal stories using words, images, and short videos. Storytelling is a very important part of luxury narratives, based as they are on experience and ‘feelings’. As Stokes and Price contend, “social media is used to construct identity through visual branding, wherein individuals utilise imagery designed to attract followers and maintain careful curation of an online persona” (159). Platforms such as Instagram can also successfully function as additional user-run marketing venues for luxury brands. Sharing pictures of perceived luxury goods, with the appropriate hashtags used, enhances the appeal of luxury brands to the broader market. This is a form of ‘free marketing’ and ‘free advertising’ which is based in storytelling and experience from ‘actual’ customers. The practice of ‘self-building’ lies at the heart of this online luxury marketing success. Here, “brand exposure in social media” has become “an interesting marketing space” for the luxury industry (von Wachenfeldt, 99). The enhancement of luxury goods online is particularly visible through the interactions of luxury brands with so-called ‘influencers’ and ‘self-styled fashionistas’ (Jin and Ryu). These individuals—often counting a large number of ‘followers’—are instrumental to the construction of luxury value via storytelling, especially for younger demographics. A considerable innovation in approaches to luxury, and how marketing and brands of luxury goods are conducted in social media and online cultures, has been the recognition that consumers value tacit notions of plurality in an effort to gain a sense of personal uniqueness. That is to say that, while luxury may be targeting ‘the masses’, in certain ways, it still needs to offer flexibility of identification and choice (Xi et al.; Debenedetti et al.). This often creates a tension between notions of autonomy and conformity: feeling unique, while also wanting to fit in, through co-existing ideas of prestige and membership (Pourazad et al.). Online users channel the idea of choice in order to “display independence” and “a distinction from the social prescription” (Song, Lee, and Kim, 102). This is, culturally and anthropologically speaking, part of how human beings have developed as part of communities. The plurality of the online consumer group must be reflected in the multifaceted ways in which luxury is represented, marketed, and sold. As Song, Lee, and Kim put it, when using social media “individuals want to present themselves in a favourable perspective and project to others their image implicitly or explicitly” (102). The possession and display of luxury goods is particularly effective for this process, by accentuating how the individual can “control the reflected impression” (Song, Lee, and Kim, 102). The celebrity discourse of luxury is also very clearly established on social media. Celebrities commonly share pictures of the interiors of their homes, their cars, their clothes and jewellery, and their holidays, often in connection to specific brands (Cuomo et al.). The practices of both celebrities and influencers draw attention to the relationships between brands and intersecting notions of uniqueness, plurality, and aspirational value (Stokes and Price). Luxury is at the centre of the narrative, acting as an identifying quality for both differences and aspirations. This engagement with visual storytelling inevitably brings to the surface preoccupations with artificiality that are perhaps intrinsic to the curation of visual images and personas on social media. Celebrity and influencer narratives on social media are often constructed on “lush visuals” (Armitage, 177), where luxury ranges from expensive and fashionable commodities to relaxation, ‘cosiness’, and the feeling of home. Social media platforms allow for individuals to become a “luxury authority” (Armitage, 177), often working tacitly with luxury experiences and brands. Even though the context is different from traditional luxury narratives, online platforms still construct the idea of luxury based on perceived notions of uniqueness and distinction (in terms of fame, lifestyle, vanity, and so on). The posting and sharing of ‘luxury images’ online goes beyond accessories such as clothes and shoes, of course, and extends to tourism and dining experiences (Michael and Fusté-Forné). Luxury food images, in particular, are connected to the building of self and identities, reliant as they are on perceived matters of taste (Lupton). Luxury food images can be broadly categorised “according to experiential (hedonism, altruism and passion collecting) and symbolic (social status, uniqueness, self-esteem and self-presentation) benefits” (Atwal et al., 454). For instance, on Instagram, hashtags such as ‘foodporn’ and ‘luxury food’ continue to garner a great number of followers and shares. While the food in question may not traditionally be perceived as’ luxury’, what is luxurious is the experience of one’s pleasure, and the beauty of the image shared (Atwal et al.). And naturally, traditional notions of ‘luxury food’—especially from high-profile restaurants—still also apply when relevant to the context of the experience in question. The desire to share not only food experiences, but luxury food experiences in particular, draws attention to cycles of consumer behaviour that are driven by a mixture of “self-importance, ordinary conversation, and extraordinary amplification” (Atwal et al., 455). This amalgamation of accessibility and exclusivity is at the heart of the online luxury experience, and pivotal to the construction of social identities as connected to luxury goods. Concluding Remarks Although the notion of luxury is a continually changing idea, there is certainly no doubting the fact that, in our contemporary era, luxury brands rely on specific socio-cultural and contextual constructions to establish their appeal. And while the concept of luxury may indeed have been historically characterised by elusiveness and exclusiveness, in the twenty-first century it has shifted from a singular elitist phenomenon to a framework of pluralistic individuality as part of visual culture storytelling. This has been predominantly driven by technological developments, particularly social media, and the rising level of consumer empowerment in the marketplace (Creevey et al.). In view of this, different strategies have been used to convey the luxury buying experience online, drawing strength from the media that the digital platform provides, both in terms of browsing and purchasing (Athwal et al.). This article has explored how, although there is an undeniable materiality to the idea of luxury, there is also a socio-cultural and socio-economic pull that relies on both popular and unpopular notions of desirability, individuality, and, broadly speaking, our sense of self (Kapferer and Bastien, p. 1). Luxury brands rely on artificially constructed ideas of both membership and exclusivity, which inevitably highlight the consumers of luxury brands as belonging to a particularly stratified sector, where ubiquitous and co-existing notions of uniqueness and plurality drive the sharing choices of consumers (Godey et al.). The shared ideologies that are intrinsic to social media have allowed both a representational and a marketing shift to take place. Here, luxury brands, luxury objects, and luxury experiences are perceived as part of visual storytelling practices that are not only entangled with the performance of identity, but that have also become highly democratised in the digital space.

What Drives Commodity Price Variation?,"Abstract We investigate the importance of time-varying discount rates for commodity prices using an index based on twenty-three commodities for the period 1959–2024. We show that in commodities markets, unlike other financial markets, time variation in discount rates plays a much smaller role. Instead, prices forecast cash flows as well as discount rates. A high price for a commodity today, measured as a low percentage net convenience yield, forecasts both a high future convenience yield and a low expected return. For longer horizons, variation in percentage net convenience yields seems mainly driven by net convenience yield growth, making commodities much closer to the classical textbook view of price changes representing news about cash flows.",2024-11-25,
Problems of information and analytical support of business management and ways to solve them,"Effective functioning of most modern commercial organizations is based on a comprehensive accounting of changes in the external and internal environment, which involves assessing the content, nature and direction of such transformations. The growth in the number and significance of ongoing changes is accompanied by a significant increase in the volume of information that must be collected, structured and interpreted for subsequent management decisions. In such conditions, there is an objective need to implement special software packages that can provide the maximum level of automation of the collection and processing of accounting information to solve problems at various levels, including monitoring the company’s cash flows, assessing and analyzing its financial condition and financial stability, determining opportunities for optimizing the capital structure, etc. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of implementing automated tools for information and analytical support for business management to ensure the effectiveness of monitoring the movement of commodity and cash flows and making sound management decisions to ensure the competitive position of the organization in the market.",2024-11-25,
Interdependence Between Energy Commodities and Global Stock Indices: A Volatility Transmission Approach,"This study aims to investigate the volatility transmission between energy commodities and global stock indices. Two primary energy commodities, Brent crude oil and Natural gas, are considered using monthly data from January 2001 to June 2023. Dynamic conditional correlation–GARCH method has been employed to examine the interdependence between two selected energy commodities and stock indices of India, the United States and Japan. The results show a high degree of interdependence between Brent crude oil and the global stock market indices of India, the United States and Japan compared to natural gas. The study also shows that long-run shocks persistent by the crude oil price variability have a more substantial influence on the global stock indices of India, the United States and Japan than short-run stocks. Swings in commodity prices and their effect on the stock market volatility indicate that policymakers and regulators should learn about financial system risks and vulnerability to external shocks.",2024-11-24,
"A Decision Support System for Stock Selection and Asset Allocation Based
  on Fundamental Data Analysis","Financial markets are integral to a country's economic success, yet their complex nature raises challenging issues for predicting their behaviors. There is a growing demand for an integrated system that explores the vast and diverse data in financial reports with powerful machine-learning models to analyze financial markets and suggest appropriate investment strategies. This research provides an end-to-end decision support system (DSS) that pervasively covers the stages of gathering, cleaning, and modeling the stock's financial and fundamental data alongside the country's macroeconomic conditions. Analyzing and modeling the fundamental data of securities is a noteworthy method that, despite its greater power, has been used by fewer researchers due to its more complex and challenging issues. By precisely analyzing securities' fundamental data, the proposed system assists investors in predicting stock future prices and allocating assets in major financial markets: stock, bond, and commodity. The most notable contributions and innovations of this research are: (1) Developing a robust predictive model for mid- to long-term stock returns, tailored for investors rather than traders, (2) The proposed DSS considers a diverse set of features relating to the economic conditions of the company, including fundamental data, stock trading characteristics, and macro-economic attributes to enhance predictive accuracy, (3) Evaluating the DSS performance on the Tehran Stock Exchange that has specific characteristics of small to medium-sized economies with high inflation rates and showing the superiority to novel researches, and (4) Empowering the DSS to generate different asset allocation strategies in various economic situations by simulating expert investor decision-making.",2024-11-24,
"Optimization of Production Inputs For Potato Farming In Sumber Brantas Village, Bumiaji District, Batu City","Potatoes are a vital horticultural commodity in Indonesia, serving as an alternative staple food and an industrial raw material. However, potato farming in Sumber Brantas Village, Bumiaji District, Batu City faces inefficiencies due to excessive use of inputs, such as seeds and fertilizers, and financial constraints arising from rising input costs. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency and optimization of production inputs in potato farming to enhance productivity and sustainability. A quantitative research approach was employed, with data collected from 50 potato farmers through interviews and questionnaires. The Cobb-Douglas production function was used to analyze input efficiency, supported by classical assumption tests, including multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and normality tests. The findings reveal that land area and seeds are relatively efficient inputs, while fertilizers, pesticides, and labor remain inefficient and underutilized. Further optimization analysis showed that none of the production inputs had achieved optimal levels, indicating overuse in some cases and underutilization in others. These inefficiencies significantly limit production outcomes. The study concludes that targeted interventions are required to optimize resource allocation and improve input management. These insights provide valuable recommendations for farmers and policymakers to enhance agricultural productivity and economic viability in the region, contributing to more sustainable potato farming practices.",2024-11-23,
Common Factors in the Profitability of Energy Firms,"The extent to which external factors explain profitability in the energy sector and their commonalities is largely unknown from the previous literature. We identify three latent factors underlying the profitability of 1,347 global energy firms, from 2000 Q1 to 2021 Q2. We rely on a novel Dynamic Factor Model estimated by Functional Principal Components. Profitability factors are strongly associated with global financial and macroeconomic factors, including energy commodity prices, interest rates, exchange rates, economic activity and financial uncertainty. We compare our empirical results for various energy subsectors and show that profitability of oil and gas companies is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and fuel prices, while renewable energy and uranium firms are more sensitive to exchange rates. We also provide a ranking of firms based on their association with the common factors of profitability, which can be used to monitor the resilience of the energy sector.

Energy Consumption and Socio-Economic Development: The Promise and Threat of Subsidy Removal in Nigeria,"The goals of subsidies are to lessen inequality, help families escape energy poverty, and lessen the negative effects of volatile commodity prices on both producers and consumers. The study provides some insight into energy consumption and socio-economic development of subsidy removal in Nigeria using the discourse analysis methodology. The study revealed that fuel subsidy removal in Nigeria would free up funds for other sectors, encourage domestic refineries to produce more petroleum products, lessen Nigeria's reliance on imported fuel, create jobs, reduce the deficit in the budget and create a budget surplus, decrease government borrowing, reduce corruption related to fuel subsidy payments, intensify competition, revitalize domestic refineries, and ease pressure on the exchange rate. Again, the withdrawal of gasoline subsidies may have the unfavorable effects (threat) of short-term slower economic growth, more inflation, greater poverty, increased fuel smuggling, higher crime rates, higher petroleum product prices, and a loss of jobs in the unorganized sector and threatening the very existence of peace and security. The study submit that the government thoroughly assess the effects of eliminating fuel subsidies on people and businesses, and offer palliative care as well as various forms of financial assistance to lessen the negative effects on them. Moreover, we advise that before fuel subsidy reforms are implemented, the required safety nets for the impoverished be put in place.",2024-11-23,
Housing and Water in Light of Financialisation and ‘Financialisation’,"This paper addresses the impact of financialisation on the systems of provision (SoPs) drawing on a series of case studies in housing and water – both non-financial sectors. In order to understand this more fully, the paper first considers some of the theoretical constructs connecting money, commodities and finance, exploring the theories of money, the extension of that theory to finance and the specification of the processes attaching finance to the non-financial. The paper shows that both case-study sectors have increasingly been subject to market forms with, for example, land markets in housing and cost recovery practices in water provision. However there are different forms of monetary relations across the case studies. Simply to equate financialisation with commodification would be misleading. The diversity of arrangements across sectors and locations is addressed in the paper by making the distinction between commodification (production for private profits), the commodity form (periodic payments for a good or service in the absence of a profit motive) and commodity calculation (application of a monetary logic without money changing hands). Each of these is associated with different forms of marketization and “market forces” but they are underpinned by different economic and social structures. The paper then goes on to tie these insights to financialisation and contemporary capitalism more generally with reference to the case studies. For housing there is variegation in the extent to which the expansion of finance coincides with expansion of material provision, as shown with for example the different outcomes from expanding lending for house production as opposed to mortgage lending for consumption. In water, there is diversity in the extent and nature of privatisation and this has led to differences in the extent and depth of financial intervention across the case studies. England and Wales lies at one extreme with heavily entrenched financialisation while this is considerably less significant in the case studies with less privatisation. The final section of this paper considers the implication of the different forms of financialisation for economic and social reproduction including gender.",2024-11-22,
"Land, agriculture and migration","The 2023 World Development Report (WDR, 2023) on migration is progressive in its advocacy for both migration and migrants, demonstrating a clear desire to build a better world for all by reducing the barriers to movement and mitigating the negative effects of hostile or insecure environments for those who migrate. Any report on a topic as large as migration—particularly one with the ambition to encompass the whole world—must focus, and the WDR 2023 has chosen to concentrate on the immediate causes and effects of moving across international borders, with income as the proxy for access to a larger basket of resources and rights, or what Amartya Sen (1976) would call entitlements. Influenced by this proxy, the report contends that economic inequality between nations is the largest predictor of who moves, and the desire to improve personal circumstance is the greatest motivation. What falls out of the report is one of the primary root causes for migration historically and today: insecure or insufficient access to land and its benefits (Hermans & McLeman, 2021; Radel et al., 2019; Sassen, 2016), which is only imperfectly captured in statistics on poverty or inequality. The WDR 2023 mentions land only twice, both times in the chapter on gender where the report rightly argues that improved land tenure security gives women greater resilience, providing them with income and stability to remain in place and support a family. This exclusion continues a longer trend in World Development Reports. Over the past 45 years (1978–2023), WDRs have exhibited an overwhelming urban and industrial focus.1 This is surprising given that the majority of the world's poor reside in rural areas, and they depend on access to land for both remaining in place and subsistence and survival. Only three reports have focused specifically on agriculture (1982, 1986 and 2008), suggesting that WDRs are less an analysis of current conditions and improvement therein and more focused on achievement of trajectories of growth (modernization) understood to require industrialization and urban development. This aspirational vision of development as a transition from rural to urban economies has dominated political perspectives and academic theories since the growth of political economy as a field of intervention in Europe in the late 1700s. Economic growth strategies have deliberately focused on moving people from rural areas to urban ones, tightening property relations and creating rental or ownership contracts that will allow the concentration of land, intensification of production, and release of 'unnecessary' or underemployed rural inhabitants (usually smallholders on untitled land deemed marginal) into the cities where they will be absorbed as cheap labour in industrial production. Even today, concerns about climate change and food insecurity have led to calls for sustainable intensification, a land-sparing approach that intertwines the concentration of high-yield agricultural production with restricted-access natural spaces, both of which are likely to lead to further out-migration from rural areas (see the debate summarized in Baudron et al., 2021). When people exit the countryside, they leave behind their primary means of production and social reproduction: the land and natural resources. Across the latter half of the 1900s, rural to urban migration filled the cities of the Global South in just 30–50 years, leading to growing informal populations and economies in over-crowded urban centres.2 None of this is news to the World Bank, which has developed a field of study and policy around land governance. A central tenet is that land tenure policies (particularly property rights) must be strengthened to mitigate forced displacement while facilitating voluntary out-migration, furthering livelihood security, competition and economic growth (German, 2022). The common wisdom is that greater tenure security will allow property holders to invest in their land, confident in their long-term access and able to use their titles as collateral for bank or corporate loans. The World Bank's Land Governance Assessment Framework is intended to evaluate the strength of a given country's land rights and rules because the bank agrees that such rules are integral to sustainable endogenous development. The need to understand land tenure dynamics has increased in recent years due to several factors, some of which the WDR 2023 highlights and others it does not. First, rapid urbanization is being accomplished in some countries by sweeping state-led dispossession and induced rural to urban migration. This has been well documented in both India and China (Andreas et al., 2020; Goldman, 2020; Levien, 2018). It is also evident in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (Mwesigye & Matsumoto, 2016). Second, climate change is making vulnerable land and farmers even more vulnerable, pushing them into cities or across borders when drought or extreme weather strikes (Clapp et al., 2018). Third, remedies for climate change include conservation and carbon mitigation or credit programmes that restrict land use in ways that may trade household vulnerability for ecological resilience (Agrawal et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2020; Vigil, 2022). Fourth, growing recognition of the greenhouse gas effects of coal and natural gas use has motivated interest in biofuels, and the push to replace food crops with spatially expansive fuel or flex crops has implications for agricultural land availability (Borras Jr et al., 2010; Rosa et al., 2021). Fifth, a series of economic crises in the mid-2000s (particularly in insurance, housing and automobile markets) along with a world food crisis that reverberated globally between 2006 and 2007, causing street protests in over 60 countries, generated increased investment in land that came to be known as the Global Land Grab (see Wolford et al., 2024). Imperfect data exists on these large-scale land acquisitions (Edelman, 2013; Liao & Agrawal, 2024) but perhaps the most significant effect is rising land prices across the globe. Higher land prices make it difficult for communities and poor households to retain access, pushing them to sell or forcing them to leave and moving to nearby rural areas, cities, or across political borders.3 According to data compiled by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Land Matrix, there is significant overlap in the countries that have the highest internal conflict, numbers of internally displaced peoples, and recent investment in land.4 Sixth, changes in financial markets have made it easier for large-scale investors such as hedge funds and pensions funds to trade farmland. This financialization of land contributes to increasing prices and concentration of ownership (Ashwood et al., 2022; Fairbairn, 2020). Seventh and finally, these economic, political, and environmental factors have combined to both justify and incentivize increased large-scale commodity and flex crop production or what some have called the 'return of the plantation' (Li & Semedi, 2021). This leads to mechanization without resulting in local jobs or development as promised. In the wake of the Global Land Grab and rising interest in plantations, some countries are re-writing their land tenure rules to favour international investment and large-scale acquisitions. This is evident with the latest round of changes to the Land Policy and Land Law in Mozambique, both of which are being revised to facilitate outside investment, suggesting that more investment into land will generate more migration from the rural areas to cities in Mozambique and beyond (Bruna et al., 2023; Tanner, 2022). One could argue that attention to land access is outside the scope of the World Development Report, but I argue that including land access fundamentally changes the perspective on migration. If the goal was to promote a policy discussion, then including an understanding of how land governance and access shape migration is necessary to understanding which policies need to be under discussion in which countries. Several factors are key to reshaping how we might think about policy. First, rural–urban migration is often the first step along a path to international migration. Second, rural–urban migration is not an unintended effect of violence, war or instability. Rather, it is an intentional effect of most development theories, policies, and prescriptions for developing countries. International migrants often bear the stigma of having been forced to flee, when it should be more widely recognized that displacement is an expected component of most growth models. Third, rural–urban migration, particularly of the poorest and most vulnerable, arguably benefits countries in the Global North that depend on raw materials for industrial production and a heavily decentralized global food system. Significant resources have been expended to assist large-scale producers in the Global South in their intensification and expansion, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, many of these corporate producers are headquartered or live in the Global North. While receiving migrants is sometimes pitched rhetorically as a form of charity, this disguises the benefit wealthy northern countries receive from landed production in the South. At a minimum, the complicated global flow of foreign direct investment in food, natural resources, and more recently, climate funds for land-based mitigation programmes, blurs the line between sending and receiving countries. Fourth, if forced migration is seen as a response to insecure land access, perhaps the discussion can broaden to include policies that strengthen local control over land, community-led decision-making around land laws and investment rules, cooperative profit sharing with local communities and 'matrix' organization (Perfecto & Vandermeer, 2010) of biodiverse small farms, conservation areas, and rural development.

Can desalination quench agriculture’s thirst?,"Ralph Loya was pretty sure he was going to lose the corn. His farm had been scorched by El Paso's hottest-ever June and second-hottest August; the West Texas county saw 53 days soar over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer of 2024. The region was also experiencing an ongoing drought, which meant that crops on Loya's eight-plus acres of melons, okra, cucumbers and other produce had to be watered more often than normal.Loya had been irrigating his corn with somewhat salty, or brackish, water pumped from his well, as much as the salt-sensitive crop could tolerate. It wasn't enough, and the municipal water was expensive; he was using it in moderation and the corn ears were desiccating where they stood.

Contending with too little water to support their plants and animals, farmers have tilled under crops, pulled out trees, fallowed fields and sold off herds. They've also used drip irrigation to inject smaller doses of water closer to a plant's roots, and installed sensors in soil that tell more precisely when and how much to water.In the last five years, researchers have begun to puzzle out how brackish water, pulled from underground aquifers, might be de-salted cheaply enough to offer farmers another water resilience tool. Loya's property, which draws its slightly salty water from the Hueco Bolson aquifer, is about to become a pilot site to test how efficiently desalinated groundwater can be used to grow crops in otherwise water-scarce places.Desalination renders salty water less so. It's usually applied to water sucked from the ocean, generally in arid lands with few options; some Gulf, African and island countries rely heavily or entirely on desalinated seawater. Inland desalination happens away from coasts, with aquifer waters that are brackish — containing between 1,000 and 10,000 milligrams of salt per liter, versus around 35,000 milligrams per liter for seawater. Texas has more than three dozen centralized brackish groundwater desalination plants, California more than 20.Such technology has long been considered too costly for farming. Some experts still think it's a pipe dream. ""We see it as a nice solution that's appropriate in some contexts, but for agriculture it's hard to justify, frankly,"" says Brad Franklin, an agricultural and environmental economist at the Public Policy Institute of California. Desalting an acre-foot (almost 326,000 gallons) of brackish groundwater for crops now costs about $800, while farmers can pay a lot less — as little as $3 an acre-foot for some senior rights holders in some places — for fresh municipal water. As a result, desalination has largely been reserved to make liquid that's fit for people to drink. In some instances, too, inland desalination can be environmentally risky, endangering nearby plants and animals and reducing stream flows.But the US Bureau of Reclamation, along with a research operation called the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI) that's been granted $185 million from the Department of Energy, have recently invested in projects that could turn that paradigm on its head. Recognizing the urgent need for fresh water for farms — which in the US are mostly inland — combined with the ample if salty water beneath our feet, these entities have funded projects that could help advance small, decentralized desalination systems that can be placed right on farms where they're needed. Loya's is one of them.US farms consume over 83 million acre-feet (more than 27 trillion gallons) of irrigation water every year — the second most water-intensive industry in the country, after thermoelectric power. Not all aquifers are brackish, but most that are exist in the country's West, and they're usually more saline the deeper you dig. With fresh water everywhere in the world becoming saltier due to human activity, ""we have to solve inland desal for ag … in order to grow as much food as we need,"" says Susan Amrose, a research scientist at MIT who studies inland desalination in the Middle East and North Africa.Brackish (slightly salty) groundwater is found mostly in the Western United States.CREDIT: J.S. STANTON ET AL / BRACKISH GROUNDWATER IN THE UNITED STATES: USGS PROFESSIONAL PAPER 1833. 2017That means lowering energy and other operational costs; making systems simple for farmers to run; and figuring out how to slash residual brine, which requires disposal and is considered the process's ""Achilles' heel,"" according to one researcher.The last half-decade of scientific tinkering is now yielding tangible results, says Peter Fiske, NAWI's executive director. ""We think we have a clear line of sight for agricultural-quality water.""Swallowing the high costFiske believes farm-based mini-plants can be cost-effective for producing high-value crops like broccoli, berries and nuts, some of which need a lot of irrigation. That $800 per acre-foot has been achieved by cutting energy use, reducing brine and revolutionizing certain parts and materials. It's still expensive but arguably worth it for a farmer growing almonds or pistachios in California — as opposed to farmers growing lesser-value commodity crops like wheat and soybeans, for whom desalination will likely never prove affordable. As a nut farmer, ""I would sign up to 800 bucks per acre-foot of water till the cows come home,"" Fiske says.Loya's pilot is being built with Bureau of Reclamation funding and will use a common process called reverse osmosis. Pressure pushes salty water through a semi-permeable membrane; fresh water comes out the other side, leaving salts behind as concentrated brine. Loya figures he can make good money using desalinated water to grow not just fussy corn, but even fussier grapes he might be able to sell at a premium to local wineries.Such a tiny system shares some of the problems of its large-scale cousins — chiefly, brine disposal. El Paso, for example, boasts the biggest inland desalination plant in the world, which makes 27.5 million gallons of fresh drinking water a day. There, every gallon of brackish water gets split into two streams: fresh water and residual brine, at a ratio of 83 percent to 17 percent. Since there's no ocean to dump brine into, as with seawater desalination, this plant injects it into deep, porous rock formations — a process too pricey and complicated for farmers.Rows of reverse osmosis membranes at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant in El Paso.CREDIT: PHOTO BY ADA COWANBut what if desalination could create 90 or 95 percent fresh water and 5 to 10 percent brine? What if you could get 100 percent fresh water, with just a bag of dry salts leftover? Handling those solids is a lot safer and easier, ""because super-salty water brine is really corrosive … so you have to truck it around in stainless steel trucks,"" Fiske says.Finally, what if those salts could be broken into components — lithium, essential for batteries; magnesium, used to create alloys; gypsum, turned into drywall; as well as gold, platinum and other rare-earth elements that can be sold to manufacturers? Already, the El Paso plant participates in ""mining"" gypsum and hydrochloric acid for industrial customers.Loya's brine will be piped into an evaporation pond. Eventually, he'll have to pay to landfill the dried-out solids, says Quantum Wei, founder and CEO of Harmony Desalting, which is building Loya's plant. There are other expenses: drilling a well (Loya, fortuitously, already has one to serve the project); building the physical plant; and supplying the electricity to pump water up day after day. These are bitter financial pills for a farmer. ""We're not getting rich; by no means,"" Loya says.More cost comes from the desalination itself. The energy needed for reverse osmosis is a lot, and the saltier the water, the higher the need. Additionally, the membranes that catch salt are gossamer-thin, and all that pressure destroys them; they also get gunked up and need to be treated with chemicals.Stay in the KnowSign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter todayReverse osmosis presents another problem for farmers. It doesn't just remove salt ions from water but the ions of beneficial minerals, too, such as calcium, magnesium and sulfate. According to Amrose, this means farmers have to add fertilizer or mix in pretreated water to replace essential ions that the process took out.To circumvent such challenges, one NAWI-funded team is experimenting with ultra-high-pressure membranes, fashioned out of stiffer plastic, that can withstand a much harder push. The results so far look ""quite encouraging,"" Fiske says. Another is looking into a system in which a chemical solvent dropped into water isolates the salt without a membrane, like the polymer inside a diaper absorbs urine. The solvent, in this case the common food-processing compound dimethyl ether, would be used over and over to avoid potentially toxic waste. It has proved cheap enough to be considered for agricultural use.Amrose is testing a system that uses electrodialysis instead of reverse osmosis. This sends a steady surge of voltage across water to pull salt ions through an alternating stack of positively charged and negatively charged membranes. Explains Amrose, ""You get the negative ions going toward their respective electrode until they can't pass through the membranes and get stuck,"" and the same happens with the positive ions. The process gets much higher fresh water recovery in small systems than reverse osmosis, and is twice as energy efficient at lower salinities. The membranes last longer, too — 10 years versus three to five years, Amrose says — and can allow essential minerals to pass through.Data-based designAt Loya's farm, Wei paces the property on a sweltering summer morning with a local engineering company he's tapped to design the brine storage pond. Loya is anxious that the pond be as small as possible to keep arable land in production; Wei is more concerned that it be big and deep enough. To factor this, he'll look at average weather conditions since 1954 as well as worst-case data from the last 25 years pertaining to monthly evaporation and rainfall rates. He'll also divide the space into two sections so one can be cleaned while the other is in use. Loya's pond will likely be one-tenth of an acre, dug three to six feet deep.From left, West Texas farmer Ralph Loya, Quantum Wei of Harmony Desalting and engineer Johanes Makahaube discuss where a desalination plant and brine pond might be placed on Loya's farm.CREDIT: PHOTO BY ADA COWANThe desalination plant will pair reverse osmosis membranes with a ""batch"" process, pushing water through multiple times instead of once and gradually amping up the pressure. Regular reverse osmosis is energy-intensive because it constantly applies the highest pressures, Wei says, but Harmony's process saves energy by using lower pressures to start with. A backwash between cycles prevents scaling by dissolving mineral crystals and washing them away. ""You really get the benefit of the farmer not having to deal with dosing chemicals or replacing membranes,"" Wei says. ""Our goal is to make it as painless as possible.""Another Harmony innovation concentrates leftover brine by running it through a nanofiltration membrane in their batch system; such membranes are usually used to pretreat water to cut back on scaling or to recover minerals, but Wei believes his system is the first to combine them with batch reverse osmosis. ""That's what's really going to slash brine volumes,"" he says. The whole system will be hooked up to solar panels, keeping Loya's energy off-grid and essentially free. If all goes to plan, the system will be operational by early 2025 and produce seven gallons of fresh water a minute during the strongest sun of the day, with a goal of 90 to 95 percent fresh water recovery. Any water not immediately used for irrigation will be stored in a tank.Spreading out the researchNinety-eight miles north of Loya's farm, along a dead flat and endlessly beige expanse of road that skirts the White Sands Missile Range, more desalination projects burble away at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico. The facility, run by the Bureau of Reclamation, offers scientists a lab and four wells of differing salinities to fiddle with.On some parched acreage at the foot of the Sacramento Mountains, a longstanding farming pilot project bakes in relentless sunlight. After some preemptive words about the three brine ponds on the property — ""They have an interesting smell, in between zoo and ocean"" — facility manager Malynda Cappelle drives a golf cart full of visitors past solar arrays and water tanks to a fenced-in parcel of dust and plants. Here, since 2019, a team from the University of North Texas, New Mexico State University and Colorado State University has tested sunflowers, fava beans and, currently, 16 plots of pinto beans. Some plots are bare dirt; others are topped with compost that boosts nutrients, keeps soil moist and provides a salt barrier. Some plots are drip-irrigated with brackish water straight from a well; some get a desalinated/brackish water mix.A brine pond at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico.CREDIT: PHOTO BY ADA COWANEyeballing the plots even from a distance, the plants in the freshest-water plots look large and healthy. But those with compost are almost as vigorous, even when irrigated with brackish water. This could have significant implications for cash-conscious farmers. ""Maybe we do a lesser level of desalination, more blending, and this will reduce the cost,"" says Cappelle.Pei Xu, has been co-investigator on this project since its start. She's also the progenitor of a NAWI-funded pilot at the El Paso desalination plant. Later in the day, in a high-ceilinged space next to the plant's treatment room, she shows off its consequential bits. Like Amrose's system, hers uses electrodialysis. In this instance, though, Xu is aiming to squeeze a bit of additional fresh — at least freshish — water from the plant's leftover brine. With suitably low levels of salinity, the plant could pipe it to farmers through the county's existing canal system, turning a waste product into a valuable resource.Xu's pinto bean and El Paso work, and Amrose's in the Middle East, are all relevant to Harmony's pilot and future projects. ""Ideally we can improve desalination to the point where it's an option which is seriously considered,"" Wei says. ""But more importantly, I think our role now and in the future is as water stewards — to work with each farm to understand their situation and then to recommend their best path forward … whether or not desalting is involved.""Sixteen plots of pinto beans at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility are being irrigated with water of differing salinities, as part of an experiment.CREDIT: PHOTO BY ADA COWANIndeed, as water scarcity becomes ever more acute, desalination advances will help agriculture only so much; even researchers who've devoted years to solving its challenges say it's no panacea. ""What we're trying to do is deliver as much water as cheaply as possible, but that doesn't really encourage smart water use,"" says NAWI's Fiske. ""In some cases, it encourages even the reverse. Why are we growing alfalfa in the middle of the desert?""Franklin, of the California policy institute, highlights another extreme: Twenty-one of the state's groundwater basins are already critically depleted, some due to agricultural overdrafting. Pumping brackish aquifers for desalination could aggravate environmental risks.There are an array of measures, say researchers, that farmers themselves must take in order to survive, with rainwater capture and the fixing of leaky infrastructure at the top of the list. ""Desalination is not the best, only or first solution,"" Wei says. But he believes that when used wisely in tandem with other smart partial fixes, it could prevent some of the worst water-related catastrophes for our food system.",2024-11-21,
Review of periodical literature for 2023: (iv) 1700–1850,"The topic of industrial revolution and industrial development attracted particular attention in 2023. Using econometric analysis Kelly et al. analysed growth pattern across English counties between 1760s and 1830s using male employment patterns to compare the contrasting explanations of the industrial revolution. They focused on textiles and iron industries and found that mechanical and related skills were crucial. Overall, Kelly et al. found that industrialization occurred in areas with low wages and high mechanical skills, whereas factors such as literacy, banks, and proximity to coal had little explanatory power. The work of Otojanov et al. on the other hand supported the 'induced innovation' hypothesis as the driving force of the industrial revolution, as cheap energy and capital induced adoption of labour-saving technologies. However, they also found that until the 1820s labour saving was modest. Galofré-Vilà explored the role of informal networks in spurring innovative activity. The author found that counties with a large number of informal networks such as Freemasonry, friendly societies, libraries, and booksellers were more innovative and produced more patents and exhibits for the 1851 Crystal Palace World's Fair. Several articles focused on industrial development. Sugden et al. explored the role of geographical factors, especially proximity to coal, for the location of woollens industry in the West Riding. They found that the key factors that facilitated the concentration in this region were coal, low cost of living, and running water. Allen studied the coal industry and transport. He found that coal markets were highly integrated, and productivity of coal shipments grew between 1695 and 1824, while the geographical pattern of production remained practically the same. Allen found that among the main reasons for the unchanging geographical pattern was the power of the Northeast coal producers that blocked the building of midland canals that would open up the market. Raman explored the role of the spinner's skill and dexterity for determining the final quality of cotton cloth. She argued that the trajectory of the British cotton industry was shaped by the pursuit of matching the quality of Indian cotton textiles and, unable to match the skills of the Indian artisans, British entrepreneurs turned to mechanization. Research on labour and living standards was also strongly represented. Sheng explored the limitations of the method of inferring time-use from court testimony. The author used Old Bailey records to study women's working time in London in 1750–1830. Sheng found that, unlike previous research that concluded that men worked longer in paid employment, women in his sample spent only slightly more time in paid work in the 1830s than in the 1750s. Sheng further argued that another limitation of the simulated time-use recall method for generating aggregate data on times worked in paid work also lies in the fact that sectoral distribution of subjects in the dataset may be biased. Paker et al. explored hiring and employment histories of over 1000 labourers employed in the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral between 1672 and 1748. They found that over the studied period the hiring strategies shifted towards labour retention and giving priority to core labourers. In this way, the employment strategies at the Cathedral were in stark contrast to the volatility that characterized pre-industrial labour demand. They also found that day wage rates remained flat over the period, but core workers had access to higher earnings, as they were given more days to work through retention and rehiring, and access to more lucrative watchman shifts. Several articles explored living standards and poor relief. Horrell relied on expenditure patterns of ordinary households between 1260 and 1869 to construct a chained-Laspeyres price index. The author used estimates of consumption of food; articles such as fuel and candles, clothing, etc.; housing costs; and durables such as furniture to reconstruct family expenditures in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Horrell's work shows a switch away from dairy with industrialization, the responsiveness of meat and poultry consumption to economic conditions, and the shift from beer consumption to beverages such as tea from the mid-eighteenth century. The author argued that, although the results are similar to 'bare bones' and the 'respectability basket', until the eighteenth century the chained-Laspeyres price index is superior in capturing price levels over industrialization. This is because the shift towards spending on imported groceries and manufactured goods introduced a new dynamic that the chained-Laspeyres price index better captures. Bujokova and Desportes explored Scottish poor relief. They presented two case studies of poor relief in Scotland – Lowland and Highland – between c.1720 and 1790. They showed that towards the end of the eighteenth century the system of poor relief transitioned from one based on a community approach rooted in parish and kirk structures to one based on legalism and the concept of rights based social provision. They also highlighted the role of Scottish political economists' ideas emphasizing progress and economic growth for this shift. Melander and Miotto examined the 1834 New Poor Law reform and its relationship to criminality. They found that the cut to welfare provision imposed by the reform led to increases in criminal activity with a 17.2 per cent increase in non-violent crime as compared with pre-reform yearly levels. Building a dataset of over 250 000 individual criminal charges between 1828 and 1840, they found that welfare cuts were related to a rise in non-violent property crimes, and these crimes occurred more in times of seasonal unemployment. Broadberry et al. presented a new chronology of business cycles for the period 1700–2010. They found that eighteenth-century business cycles had a shorter duration of 3.4 years and amplitude of 3.2 per cent than those in the post-1945 period, which were on average 16 years with an amplitude of 51.9 per cent. They found that the leading cause of economic fluctuations in the eighteenth century were shocks to agricultural production. The most important of these shocks was the Great Frost of 1709–10, which reduced GDP by 20 per cent. Eighteenth-century recessions were also caused by wars and financial crises. In the nineteenth century the importance of sectoral shocks, such as agricultural shocks, somewhat declined, whilst financial crises continued to be an important factor. The importance of wars declined only after the major economic shock brought by the Napoleonic wars. In the nineteenth century, increasing trade and capital liberalization saw shocks to commodity prices and international trade emerge as causes of recessions. In financial history, the focus was on the Bank of England and also on insurance. O'Brien and Palma, using recalibrated financial data, found that the Bank of England, even though it was a private institution, fulfilled a public role over the eighteenth century, well before the emergence of the Bagehot doctrine. The authors argue that, by providing financial intermediation, the Bank contributed to the development of the fiscal-naval state. Importantly, the Bank provided the state with credit, particularly at times when private credit was unavailable. Yet, the Bank had autonomy from the state and was able to deny the provision of funds when such a step undermined its financial safety. Milevsky focused on eighteenth-century debates surrounding choice architecture – how to design investment options in a retirement plan – and on default options and auto-enrolment into insurance schemes. The author studied the case of Adam Smith, who joined the annuity scheme Scottish Ministers' Widows' Fund when he was elected professor at the University of Glasgow. Very strongly represented was research on slavery. Absell studied the effects of slave emancipation in the British Empire on the sugar industry in Brazil. The author found that emancipation and subsequent trade liberalization led to increased demand for Brazilian sugar. Brazil thus saw an expansion of exports and its share of the world sugar market grew. Mishler explored enslaved people's engagement with the legal system in cases of legal activism in the British Empire. Roberts used slave ship drug invoices to relate the slave trade and captivity and drugs. Schwarz studied attitudes of important members of the Royal family towards the slave trade and abolition. The author shows the high level of polarization within the national debate on the issue of abolition by emphasizing that even within the Royal family there was a distinct division of opinion, with the Duke of Clarence, later William IV, favouring the slave trade. Radburn studied firms that supplied gunpowder to the slave trade and the stimulus that the trade gave to the explosives industry in Britain. The author emphasized that, as merchants from Bristol and Liverpool supplanted London slave merchants, new powder works opened in the areas focused on satisfying the specific demands from slave trading. However, as Radburn pointed out, only about 12 per cent of the British production of gunpowder was exported to Africa, so although the African market was essential to the firms connected to slave traders in the provinces, this did not apply to the industry as a whole. These firms were highly specialized, and the quality of the product they made precluded, for example, supplying the British state, and so even after abolition the firms continued to supply African markets. Business history was represented by articles on profit, trade, trading, and merchant networks and also had strong links to slavery. O'Sullivan explored the notion and the understanding of profit in the eighteenth century. To do so, the author studied revolts of Cornish copper miners in the late eighteenth century. O'Sullivan underlined that these revolts were not driven by luddism but were instead a protest against stoppages in mining activity undertaken by the owners who sought to decrease the supply of copper in efforts to increase prices and expand their profits whilst threatening the livelihood of the miners. She concluded that profit needs to be studied in a broader framework and in association with power. Ruderman and van Waijenburg examined the Royal African Company's behaviour in its post-monopoly period using letters to slave ship captains between 1685 and 1706. They emphasized the Company's organizational flexibility epitomized in better safeguarding of ships, more efficient management of slave voyages, and better monitoring of agents in Africa whose opportunities for cheating expanded with the opening of the slave trade. Sweet focused on the economic and social history of a British trading family involved principally in the slave trade – the family of Ambrose Lace. The author argues that, unlike some other British families and corporations whose business activities implicated them in slavery, the Laces focused on slavery as their main enterprise. Sweet links Ambrose Lace with the Calabar massacre and retells the subterfuge that Lace and his firm used to dissuade suspicion and to uphold their business reputation. Buckles presented a case study of John Pinney, a Bristol merchant with a plantation in Nevis, and his social network. The author modified historical social network analysis to better accommodate change over time by incorporating a 2-year moving memory total. Buckles used the methodology to study the business network of Pinney, the experience of enslaved people connected to the network, and the role of Pinney's wife Jane in the commercial network. Research on the economic role of women and their experience in the labour market was very strongly represented. Shepard emphasized that distinction between 'productive' and 'reproductive' work is a concept that originated in the nineteenth century and would make little sense to early modern women, as care work was often a commercial endeavour. Phillips examined the ways London theatre companies dealt with temporary absences of actresses due to childbearing in the late eighteenth century. The author found that about 20 per cent of actresses under contract with Covent Garden gave birth in the season 1784–5. Phillips found that actresses in major theatres received 1 or 2 months of maternity leave from at least 1770 onwards, and a range of accommodations were available for pregnant actresses. Furthermore, theatre managers also adapted the day-to-day business such as premieres, rehearsals, etc., to accommodate for actresses' absence. Wakelam argued that the increasing marriage rates and the declining rates of women incarcerated due to indebtedness over the eighteenth century imply that women's economic independence declined. This finding is in contrast to the scholarship that emphasized the continued economic agency of women after marriage. Brock studied the ways in which women shaped private trade of the East India Company. The author reviewed over 1300 petitions addressed to the Company by women between 1600 and 1757 focusing on the various relationships and roles women had. Brock found that about 15 per cent of the petitions sent by women related to private trade in which women were involved and emphasized that women in merchant families had a degree of autonomy and that a woman's credit and trust was often separate from her husband's. Whitehead explored the role letter writing performed in establishing the political authority of elite women and the ways in which letters were used to negotiate patronage. Bolissian used popular health texts to challenge the masculinization hypothesis and claims that women bodies after menopause were perceived by early modern medicine as becoming increasingly masculine. Several papers explored institutions from varied perspectives. Grajzl and Murrell studied caselaw development around land, inheritance, and families, and its impact on economic development. They found that developments in caselaw related to families and inheritance shaped real-income growth. The authors argue that changes in caselaw allowed for new ways of distributing family property and thus enabled new commercial activities to take place. Dimitruk argued that the Glorious Revolution of 1688 expanded access to estate bills to gentry families. Most of the estate bills focused on removing entails and restrictions on the sale of land. The author argued that these acts facilitated Smithian growth in land and credit markets. However, Dimitruk emphasized that passing individual acts was second best to a wholesale reform of the inheritance institutions, as it created opportunities for rent-seeking on the part of members of parliament (MPs) and brokers who prepared the bills for gentry families. Taylor studied tolls on grain – payments made by merchants to market owners for the privilege to sell the grain on their market. The author found that over the eighteenth century tolls became increasingly criticized for obstructing trade, and some markets started to abolish the practice. Skjönsberg used the writings of a Quaker merchant Richard Champion to explore the role of 'ordinary men' in shaping eighteenth-century politics. Halliday emphasized English law's capacity for mutation. Lidwell-Durnin explored the role of scientific authority in dispelling public fear in the case of the 1782 London caterpillar outbreak – an invasion of brown-tail moth caterpillars, which prompted fears of famine and plague. Camoglu explored the experience of plague in 1722 London as depicted by Daniel Defoe in a novel A Journal of the Plague Year. The author emphasized the collectively shared experience of the disease against the physical experience of isolation that was an outcome of disease prevention protocols. Maritime history was represented by articles on risk and on institutional frameworks governing shipping. A series of papers on risk and uncertainty in the early modern world were published in the International Journal of Maritime History. Wade et al. argued for the need to reassess the ways that actors in the maritime economy dealt with risk and challenges brought by the natural environment as well as by political and social challenges. They show how this provides new insights into globalization and economic development in the early modern world. Reid explored risk mitigation strategies of British merchant ships and points towards small alterations in the construction of merchant ships that followed the specific demands of the shipyards' clients connected to cargo capacity, structural integrity, and salaries of sailors. Reid thus empathized that sailing ship technologies remained static as previous research has argued but developed alongside the needs of its clients and with a view of natural hazards and commercial risks that sailing entailed. Dyble and Iodice introduced the AveTransRisk database that captures routes, cargo, weather conditions, ships, seafarers, and transaction costs of maritime trade. Jopling studied English privateering and challenged the perception that privateers believed in the notion of egalitarianism and had an anti-authority view. Instead, the author argued that, even though some elements of democracy were present, fragmentation between the notions of seventeenth-century buccaneers and privateers and eighteenth-century pirates existed, and this undermines the view that there was a universally shared 'discipline' observed by all. Tucker examined productivity of British shipping in the Atlantic using records of 25250 records of vessels entering and clearing Chesapeake Bay. The author found that over the eighteenth century port times decreased by about half and attributed this to increased attention to productivity, which was met by improved labour supply for ships. This labour supply was achieved through longer or more coercive contracts and thus decreased freedom for mariners. Articles on the history of economic thought focused on the Scottish Enlightenment and the political economy of population. Pye explored the writing of history in eighteenth-century Scotland and emphasized that, by rejecting the whiggish explanations of social progress and liberation brought by the Glorious Revolution, the Scottish Enlightenment brought focus on new explanations. The Scottish Enlightenment put a special stress on the role of commercial civilization and commerce as a force of modernization and a shift from the feudal past. Smith explored Hobbes' concepts of the political economy of population. The author emphasized that, although predemographic theorists such as Hobbes had an interest in state economies and had seen them as a system made of sectors based on a division of labour and exchanges, Hobbes construed population qualitatively rather than in numerical terms. Smith points out that, even though population theories were not strongly articulated in Hobbes' work, he held the view prevalent in the Tudor period that the monarch needed to strongly control population – its inflow, outflow, and quality – to prevent the population turning into a mob. Geography, travel, and the social perceptions thus created, also attracted, attention. Hsieh studied eighteenth-century British geography books and association with the expansion of travel and the Empire and pointed towards the particular popularity of Chinese landscapes. Mitchell looked at how English travel writing depicted the commonalities and differences between the English and Dutch based on commonalities, exchange, and interaction. The author points towards the English perceptions of the United Provinces as 'free' and this freedom as based on egalitarian and republican principles – which travel writers viewed with suspicion and as principles that led to both the rise and downfall of the United Provinces.",2024-11-21,
"A Deep Learning Approach to Predict the Fall [of Price] of
  Cryptocurrency Long Before its Actual Fall","In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly rising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more volatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign exchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain condition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the magnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also called volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they experience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the cryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the models have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model has been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed model gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of 0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin, etc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the lower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with proper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.",2024-11-20,
"Politics, policy and action: lessons from rural GP advocacy in Ireland","Context: Ireland has one of the most rural populations in Europe. Rurality presents challenges when accessing health services but should not be perceived as problematic and in need of a structural fix. Structural urbanism where health care is viewed as a commodity for individuals, rather than an infrastructure for populations, innately favours larger urban populations and has detrimental outcomes for rural health. In this article we present a brief account of advocacy led by rural GPs, their communities, and the political and policy implications of their efforts. Issues: In the period 2010–2016, Irish rural general practices were struggling for viability. Two key financial supports, distance coding and the Rural Practice Allowance, were withdrawn. This directly contributed to the founding of the 'No Doctor No Village' public campaign, following which the Rural Practice Allowance took shape as the Rural Support Practice Framework and was expanded to cover a larger number of rural practices. The World Rural Health Conference in June 2022 at the University of Limerick invited over 600 expert delegates who contributed to the authorship of the Limerick Declaration, a blueprint for advancing rural health in Ireland and internationally. This created a new momentum in advocacy for Irish rural general practice, which has drawn financial investments, sparked research interest building capacity for a pipeline to train rural general practitioners. Lessons learned: Local voices have driven monumental change in the Irish healthcare context. For these communities, the policy and politics of rural health are mere tools to maintaining or restoring their way of life. The biggest lesson to be learned is that unrelenting community commitment, when supported by the capacity to advocate, can influence politics and policy to generate sustainable outcomes and thriving communities.",2024-11-20,
MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF NUTRIENT USE IN BIOFLOC SYSTEM VANAME SHRIMP TO MAXIMIZE FARMING PROFITS,"Aquaculture is one of the alternative activities in increasing fisheries production. Shrimp is the commodity with the highest number of exports, which is 239.28 million kilograms. The key to the growth of cultured biota is by feeding nutrients in order to increase company profits.

Predictive Modeling of US Stock Market and Commodities: Impact of Economic Indicators and Geopolitical Events Using Machine,"Comprehending the dynamics of the stock market is pivotal for investors, policymakers, and economists in the USA. The United States stock market being one of the most influential financial markets in the world, contributes significantly to shaping the world economy. This research project aimed to bridge the important gaps in understanding the interrelationship between economic indicators and geopolitical events concerning the performance of the US stock market and commodities. The prime objective was to assess how different economic indicators have an impact on stock market performance over a specific period. In this regard, the development of machine learning models facilitated the ability to forecast stock market and commodities trends. These models utilized economic indicators and geopolitical events from historical data to predict future movements in the market with higher accuracy than the traditional forecasting technique followed. The study considered several different datasets to comprehensively analyze the effects that economic indicators and geopolitical events have on the stock market and commodity performances. The key datasets used in this analysis involve historical stock market indices such as the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ, as well as commodity prices for gold, oil, and silver. These datasets were collected from reputed financial databases such as Bloomberg and Federal Reserve Economic Data-FRED, for metrics including GDP growth rates, unemployment rates, inflation figures, and interest rates. The researchers also gathered data on geopolitical events: elections, trade wars, and military conflicts, using usually reliable news archives like Reuters, Bloomberg News, and The New York Times. Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XG-Boost algorithms were selected to capture various facets of the data. The performance metrics used to evaluate the models in this study included Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared. Random Forest Regressor outperformed the other models with the lowest RMSE, showcasing its ability to model complex relationships. XG-Boost Regressor equally delivered a strong balance between performance and computational efficiency, achieving similar accuracy to Random Forest. Results from this study therefore can inform policy makers, especially in regards to stabilizing the financial markets during periods of heightened economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Key recommendations include developing proactive policy measures that could dampen the effect of adverse economic indicators and geopolitical events on market stability.",2024-11-19,
Managing State Finances Amid Globalization; Challenges And Opportunities,"The increasing complexity and dependency of the global financial system are among the impacts of globalization on Indonesia's financial management. Globalization is often associated with the economy, politics, and society globally. This phenomenon indicates an increasing interconnectedness between countries worldwide. As a result, globalization creates broader impacts, influencing nearly every aspect of human life at the local, national, and global levels. The approach used in this study is qualitative with a literature review method. The results show that state financial management must be carried out in an orderly manner, in compliance with laws and regulations, and executed with high efficiency, economy, and effectiveness. Human resource competence becomes a critical element of achieving optimal state financial management. Globalization, a complex phenomenon involving economic, political, social, and cultural integration worldwide, is a process that accelerates interactions and exchanges between individuals, companies, governments, and institutions across different parts of the world. Globalization has become a significant factor influencing the regulation of state financial management. In the era of globalization, Indonesia faces unique challenges and opportunities in managing its finances. Some affected aspects include economic dependency due to Indonesia's increasing global connectivity through international trade, foreign investment, and capital flows. This affects state revenue and fiscal policy, as global economic fluctuations can impact tax revenue, commodity prices, and domestic financial market conditions.

Global Financial Market Spillovers to the Dhaka Stock Exchange: Strategic Insights From Trade‐Friendly Nations,"ABSTRACT This study explores the strategic implications of global financial market spillovers on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), with a particular emphasis on the financial markets of Bangladesh's key trade partners. Leveraging daily price data, the analysis focuses on major equity indices from Bangladesh, the USA, China, Japan, Russia, and India, in addition to global green and commodity indices. The study employs advanced methodologies, including value at risk (VaR), conditional value at risk (CVaR), continuous wavelet transforms (CWT), wavelet coherence (WC), and time‐varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP‐VAR). The findings reveal that while the DSE demonstrates lower downside risk relative to global indices, certain global assets, such as WTICO, exhibit heightened tail risk. The wavelet analyses underscore significant volatility and co‐movements among key assets, particularly during periods of global crises, such as the COVID‐19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict, highlighting the profound interconnectedness between global and regional markets and the DSE. Notably, global green and commodity assets provide potential safe haven benefits for Bangladeshi investors during times of crisis. The TVP‐VAR model further highlights the dynamic nature of volatility spillovers, identifying global green indices as key volatility transmitters, while the DSE retains robust internal market dynamics with reciprocal spillovers between DSE30 and DSEB. These insights suggest that Bangladesh should strategically integrate green and commodity assets into its financial markets to bolster market stability and protect investors amidst global uncertainties.",2024-11-17,
"The World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists’ Fellowship Programs: Past, Present, and Future","See Article, page 1259 Papua New Guinea (PNG), a low-middle-income country (LMIC) in the Asia Pacific Region with a population of approximately 12 million people,1 is served by 33 physician anesthesiologists. Although the first recorded anesthetic was given in 1896 in PNG,2 no anesthesiology residency program was offered for about 100 years in either PNG or the Pacific region. Medical graduates who wished to pursue a career in anesthesia were required to train in Australia or Philippines, often involving stressful processes for medical licensing, emigration, financial challenges, and location of a suitable supervisor and training hospital. PNG began its anesthesia postgraduate training in the late 1980s with the first graduates finishing with a Master of Medicine (MMED) in 1991. The program was designed to produce competency in general anesthesiology and to expose trainees to the basics of subspecialty care.2 The next advance in anesthesia practice in PNG was the introduction of subspecialty care. In 2011, to offer cardiothoracic surgical services, the first subspecialty program was developed for cardiothoracic anesthesia. This was supported by the Royal Australian College of Surgeons (RACS). In 2016, 2 anesthesiologists from PNG completed a World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) 6-month fellowship, one in pediatric anesthesia in Vellore, India and the other in obstetric anesthesia in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Subsequently, with the goal of building a well-qualified team, the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) supported additional opportunities in clinical practice, education, leadership, and research for these 2 anesthesiologists and their colleagues in PNG. Fortunately, today anesthesiology is increasingly seen as an attractive specialty to medical school graduates who have benefited from the leadership, teaching, and mentorship of subspecialist anesthesiologists. The national tertiary care hospital provides some specialized perioperative pediatric and obstetric services and, in conjunction with University of Papua New Guinea and ANZCA, subspecialty training in pediatric and obstetric anesthesia has started in PNG, with the initial in-country trained fellows due to graduate this year. PNG is the first Pacific Island country to offer subspecialty anesthesia training. This success story illustrates a positive outcome from the WFSA fellowships program and collaborative partners. The WFSA was established in 1955 with a vision of global health equality. Although the WFSA had been involved with anesthesia training programs in LMICs for a long time, the international fellowship programs are a more recent initiative conducted in conjunction with various partners. Professor Fujimori, the WFSA Education Committee Chair from 1992 to 1996, began the discussions on fellowship programs. The aim was to have fellows return home with capacity in leadership, education and research and the ability to make positive changes in their workplace.3–7 The first WFSA fellowship program led by the Chair of the WFSA Education Committee, Dr Haydn Perndt, and the head of the Bangkok Anaesthesia Regional Training Centre (BARTC), Professor Thara Tritrakarn, was started in 1996 for general anesthesia in Bangkok. Dr Perndt and the director of the training center in Santiago, Dr Sylvana Cavalieri, set up the first subspecialty pediatric anesthesia fellowship program in Santiago in 1998.4,6–10 Since then, more programs have been established globally and over 400 fellows have been trained from 62 different countries. Initially, funding to support these fellowships was limited so WFSA launched the ""Fund a Fellow"" campaign in 2016 to increase its reach to potential sponsors. The campaign, now called ""Fund a Colleague's Education (FACE)"" includes sharing of testimonials of the WFSA fellows and reports.5,11,12 Despite significant progress in terms of numbers of fellows trained, there has been no formal evaluation of the impact of the fellowships program. Is the program working? Is change happening? In this issue of Anesthesia & Analgesia, Bould et al13 have attempted to answer these questions by evaluating the factors influencing the transfer of new skills and knowledge to home countries for 2 WFSA fellowship programs: the pediatric anesthesia fellowship in East Africa and the regional anesthesia fellowship in Asia. The authors are to be commended for conducting the first formal study evaluating the impact of the WFSA fellowship programs. They found that graduated fellows had a positive influence on clinical practice, service development, research, and teaching. Contextual differences between the fellowship program and the home institution created some barriers to skill and knowledge transfer. There are many challenges faced by fellows when they return home. The new fellows may find their new subspecialty is not supported and they are deployed to general, nonspecialty surgical cases. Their workplaces may lack the necessary anesthesia machines, monitors, and medications required to perform safe anesthesia or to apply new subspecialty skills. Fellows may become frustrated due to the high workload, poor financial incentives, and lack of leadership and support. We must ask ourselves ""How do we evaluate educational outcomes for the WFSA fellowships? What is a success?"" Bould et al13 make recommendations for improving the transfer of knowledge and skill to practice in the home institution post fellowship. They suggest that programs select fellows from institutions with potential to support the fellow's subspecialty practice. They highlight the importance of fellowship training extending beyond medical knowledge and skills to include training in effective leadership, teaching, research, and change management. The authors also recommend strategic partnerships to facilitate the supply of essential monitors, equipment, and medications. It is disheartening and counterproductive for a fellow trained in regional anesthesia to have no access to an ultrasound machine or regional block needles. Other examples of success deserve consideration. The early years of Mongolia's anesthesia history had many difficulties including workforce shortages, absence of formal training programs and a lack of leadership and advocacy. A positive change began with the establishment of the Bangkok Anesthesia Regional Training Center in Thailand. Twenty-six Mongolian trainees completed this fellowship program and returned to Mongolia to be the driving force in the development of Mongolia's anesthesia educational programs, improving clinical practice and providing advocacy and leadership. The returning graduates were supported by the Mongolian Society of Anesthesiologists and the Australian Society of Anaesthetists, who developed a strategic plan to modernize the training of Mongolian anesthesiologists.14 These collaborations were essential for reducing the postfellowship system barriers and promoting ongoing mentorship and postfellowship collegiality. The graduates have become mentors and educators for the next generation of anesthesiologists. We must highlight the importance of bidirectional knowledge and ongoing mentorship postfellowship.13 Ideally, fellowship supervisors in the host institution should have some familiarity with the working conditions of the visiting fellows so that the program can be best adapted to create conditions for success on returning to the home country. It would be of great value to maintain communication and mentorship between the supervisor and fellow postfellowship. Through a process of mutual learning, the supervisors can continue to improve their ability to train future fellows. The on-site presence of a supervisor allows continuous exchange of knowledge and skills, including mentorship in research, teaching, and leadership. This on-site presence fosters motivation.15 Keeping motivation high, and constant, is not easy but is essential to driving change. Choosing fellowship centers appropriately may be one of the key factors in the success. Ideally, fellows should acquire new knowledge and skills for better anesthetic care in an environment that resembles conditions in their home country but includes opportunities their home country lacks. Therefore, rather than training in high-income countries, we recommend that anesthesiologists from LMICs complete fellowships in another LMIC where there are qualified supervisors and better facilities, equipment, and medications. The surgical profile should be close to that of the home country. In addition to making training more meaningful and relevant to fellows, supervisors will be more effective when they understand the context from which the fellow originates. There is an urgent need to train more anesthesiologists from LMICs. Subspecialty training is also crucial, and numbers of subspecialty trained anesthesiologists must be increased in parallel with the increase in general training. There is also the challenge to reach more sponsors and funds to facilitate training, particularly if bidirectional exchange is to be supported. But what would be more feasible and less costly in the long term is to support the fellows to develop the anesthesia training programs in their home countries. The advantage of this is that the programs are contextualized and the capacity to enroll more anesthesiologists is greater. Ultimately, the goal is to establish subspecialty training programs within home countries with regional support, as Bould et al. recommend. This will strengthen the quality of care and enrich the institutional learning environment. Anesthesiologists in LMICs are a very precious commodity. It is hard to spare an anesthesiologist for 6 to 12 months of subspecialty training. Nevertheless, as Bould et al highlight, fellows have great potential to make a positive impact in their home countries, through education, leadership, and clinical services. The situation we describe in PNG is 1 example of success from WFSA fellowship training. DISCLOSURES Name: Pauline B. Wake, MBBS, DA, MMED.

The Financial Life of Funerals before Death,"This chapter explores the financial life of funerals before death. Focusing on funerals as commodities, we argue that future sociological research into death, dying and bereavement should be critically attuned to the extractive value of mourning rituals. Existing studies illuminate no end of practical, emotional and symbolic meaning-making, as these relate to familial relations, kinship networks and work settings, yet frequently do so with little explicit appreciation of the underlying political-economic context structuring such activity. Coupled with new and emerging possibilities for body disposal and funeral services, as well as shifting sensibilities towards death more generally, this has led many sociologists to highlight the dynamics between funerary tradition, religion, technology and contemporary culture, as manifest through individual consumer choice. Adopting a broader view of 'the social' in order to emphasise the generalising drive of money capital, we argue that rapid expansions in pre-need funeral markets have occurred in an attempt to fix some of capitalism's most elementary and persistent crisis tendencies. We explore some contradictions and consequences of this expansion, before concluding with some possible questions for sociologists of death and dying to pursue in the future.",2024-11-13,
Predicted Increase in Gold Price Every Year with Impact on Economic Factors,"The purpose of this study is to develop a predictive model to predict the trend of the emas price over time and to investigate how this affects important economic variables. As a popular commodity that is regarded as a safe refuge for investments, changes in the price of emas can have a significant impact on a number of economic indicators, such as inflation, consumer spending, and investment decisions. Compiling historical data on emas prices, macroeconomic variables, and other related topics is a component of research methodology. Regression analysis and ARIMA modeling are two methods of deret waktu analysis that can be used to create an andal model of problems. The model's predictive accuracy is then determined by using appropriate statistical metrics. This study's findings provide new and important information about the factors influencing changes in the price of emas and how they affect the economy as a whole. The model that is being used can be used by investors, financial institutions, and policymakers to predict gold price movements and make informed decisions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities. The implications of this research extend all the way to the emas market since it increases our understanding of the close relationship between commodity prices and economic dynamics. The knowledge gained can help create more comprehensive investment and economic policies, which will eventually affect the stability of the economy and economic growth.",2024-11-13,
"Identification of Factors Leading to Unfit Medical Products and Other Health Commodities, Disposal Management and Related Perceived Consequences to Health Supply Chain in Rwanda. Case of Rwanda Medical Supply Ltd and Medical &amp; Allied Service Solutions Ltd","Abstract Background Unfit medical products, especially poor quality / damaged / expired / and phased out (no longer accepted for use) are among health challenges that need careful attention and adequate management in developing countries health supply chains, including Rwanda. Not only does medical wastage affect the public health in general, but also it affects financial capabilities. Actually, according to the Management Science for Health, countries on average spend about 25% of their total health expenditure on medicines, and a significant part of the funds expended on critical drugs is wasted. Objectives The main objective of this study is to identify the factors leading to unfit medical products and related perceived consequences to the supply chain management in Rwanda. Specific Objectives I. To identify the most commonly found unfit medical products in RMS and MEDIASOL. II. Explore factors contributing to unfit medico-pharmaceuticals in RMS and MEDIASOL. III. To explore perceived consequences of unfit medical products to the supply chain management in RMS and MEDIASOL. IV. To explore the disposal methods of unfit pharmaceuticals management in RMS and MEDIASOL Methods The mixed method research design used, data were collected from 20 key informant by doing interview, A questionnaire containing open questions was used and cross-sectional study were used both focusing on identify the most commonly found unfit medical products in RMS and their management, then the shared data were transcribed and translated by the researchers. Main ideas from each Key informant were merged under each theme and sub themes by reading and then rereading to identify common words, phrases and perceptions that were coded. Quantitative data were coded and analyzed using SPSS and EXCEL software. Results The study found that the most common unfit medico-pharmaceuticals are the laboratory commodities, malaria commodities and program products including quinine, and Haloperidol retard 50mg/ml injection and Insulin combinations, the study indicated that the Lack of local manufacturers of pharmaceutical products according to market needs; Change of medical products protocols; Minimum shelf life not specified while ordering the products; and Lack of accurate data to facilitate quantification were highlighted by the respondents as the main factors leading to unfit medicinal products. And the study found that the total unfit products were 3% of the average annual loss in unfit medicinal products compared to the total stock. The study recommended that further research should be done on this topic especially by exploring effective mechanisms and strategies to mitigate the wastage of medical products and other health commodities in Rwanda. Conclusions Medical products are critical for preserving lives in morbid diseases, yet they can get unfit from their intended use for different identified reasons in this study as presented in the summary of factors leading to unfit medical products. Those factors are for example the: Low consumption rate of some products; Sudden change of medical treatment protocols; Procurements without specific minimum required shelf life of products at arrival; etc. Then, were identified twenty-three (23) common unfit products also presented in the results, as well as the perceived consequences of unfit medical products to the supply chain; and three main applied disposal methods are incineration, plastic materials recycling and reuse of unfit products for other purposes. Future studies are needed to explore this important topic more broadly and come up with sustainable strategies to properly manage the medical products throughout the entire supply chain",2024-11-13,
"Uncertainty, stock and commodity prices during the Ukraine–Russia war","This article mainly investigates whether the war in Ukraine-Russia induces uncertainties and how this affects the returns of world stock market indices and commodity prices. To do so, we use the Economic Policy Uncertainty index (EPU), 96 stock market indices and the price of 67 commodities worldwide over the period from January 2022 to April 2023. Our empirical results show that the war between Ukraine and Russia increases uncertainties, and which negatively affect the performance of global financial markets and lead to higher commodity prices. These negative shocks tend to be smaller the longer the war persists. We also observe that responses to war-induced uncertainties are stronger in Europe and America. Overall, we provide unique evidence of the impact of war on uncertainties and how this is transmitted to stock market performance and commodity prices.",2024-11-12,
Socio-Economic Aspect of a Person’s Image Representation in the Khakass Proverbial Picture of the World,"Purpose. The article describes Khakass proverbs and sayings that represent the socio-economic relations of a person in society. Currently, many issues relating to the description of a person’s image through paremic expressions in the Khakass language have not yet received proper coverage, which determines the relevance of this study. Results. The authors have come to the conclusion that the socio-economic aspect is widely represented in Khakass proverbs and sayings. It is realized in the images of people, relatives, children, friends, enemies, masters, guests, neighbors, as well as men and women. The image of the people affirms the norms and rules of collectivism and peaceful coexistence in society. Children, parents and relatives are the main components of family relationships and always come to the aid of each other. The host is distinguished by his hospitality, and the guest, in turn, does not abuse this. As a rule, neighbors are endowed with such qualities as kindness and responsiveness. Based on the analyzed linguistic material, a man is endowed with a higher proportion of stereotypical characteristics: strength, stamina, strength of character, etc. And a woman appears as a kind, gentle and strong person. Conclusion. Economic relations reflect the ideas about a person’s financial condition, their work activity and the commodity-money sphere. The key to a person’s success in the Khakass society is adherence to the principles of col-lectivism, mutual assistance, tolerance, perseverance, education of the younger generation and caring attitude towards each other.",2024-11-09,
Scientific production on risks and financial instruments for commodity management,"Introduction: Commodity management benefits from a variety of financial instruments and tools that allow companies to mitigate risks and optimize their operations. Among the most used are futures contracts, contracts for difference, risk management tools such as insurance and investment funds. The objective of this article is to analyze the scientific production on risks and financial instruments for the management of raw materials. Methodology: The research paradigm is mixed, through the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. A bibliometric analysis was carried out which was complemented with a documentary review. The study was synthesized in three stages and was carried out in the Google Scholar, Scielo and SCOPUS databases, during the period from 1991 to 2024, without limitations in language. Results: The literature review shows an increase in the adoption of digital technologies to improve internal communication and employee engagement, with Brazil as a leader in the Latin American region. In addition, endomarketing is identified as a key element for attracting and retaining talent, especially in sectors with high competition and a shortage of specific skills. Likewise, its contribution to organizational sustainability is highlighted, focusing on the social dimension by promoting the well-being and development of employees. Conclusion: These findings reflect how endomarketing has been integrated into business strategies to align corporate objectives with the values ​​of social responsibility and job satisfaction, consolidating itself as an essential tool in improving productivity and long-term commitment.",2024-11-08,
Appraising the potentials of reusing plastic bottles as building blocks for housing construction at Paipe village Abuja Nigeria,"Plastic bottles package a multitude of commodities consumed worldwide. Upon consumption of the commodity, the disposed plastic bottles accumulate as waste, having impacts on both the aquatic and terrestrial environment. In a bid to convert such waste to wealth, plastic bottles are creatively reused for different applications, such as pedestrian bridge boats and street furniture, amongst others. Another application of reusing plastic bottles is their serving as building blocks for housing construction. Reports and research in Nigeria confirm the proliferation of plastic bottles littering the environment, which if reused in housing construction has the potential to contribute to achieving both UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 11 (making human settlements sustainable) and 12 (ensuring sustainable consumption and production). Although Nigeria is traced to being the first country in Africa to reuse plastic bottles in housing construction, not much research output exists from practitioners’ experience on the potentials of reusing plastic bottles as a sustainable construction material as practiced in countries like Vietnam, India, and the Philippines, among others. As such, this study investigates the potential factors driving the practice of reusing plastic bottles in Nigeria with a view to ascertaining the satisfaction derived from the practice for sustainable housing construction. Primary data was collected using a structured questionnaire from 41 respondents identified as having experience in using plastic bottles in construction (5 staffs of Awonto Konsult as well as 36 staffs of Brains and Hammers Construction). Data was analysed descriptively using both IBM SPSS Statistics 23 as well as MS Excel to compute the Mean Score as well as the Relative Satisfaction Index (RSI). Only 30 questionnaires were successfully retrieved and fully answered. Amongst the 10 potential factors studied driving reusing plastic bottles, results show that almost all respondents tend to be ‘satisfied’ with both ‘strength and stability’ (having a Mean Value of 4.70 and RSI of 0.94) as well as ‘durability’ (having a Mean Value of 4.50; RSI of 0.90) of buildings built with plastic bottles. These two factors recorded the highest ‘satisfaction’ ratings, leaning towards ‘very satisfied’. Regarding the factor ‘fire resistance’ of buildings built with plastic bottles (having a Mean Value of 3.40; RSI of 0.68), results reveal that 50 percent of the respondents are ‘unsure’ if it is a satisfactory factor driving reusing plastic bottles or not. The study found that the satisfaction ratings of technical and environmental factors have higher appeal to respondents compared to health and safety and also financial factors. It is recommended that Awonto Konsult and also Brains and Hammers Construction invest more in information related to the fire resistance of plastic bottles used in construction because fire outbreaks pose great threats to buildings. Equally, wider empirical research on plastic bottle wastes, if undertaken, could support the development of policies for waste management, particularly in developing countries. This research has the potential to convert waste into wealth in a bid to minimising environmental impacts of disposed plastic bottles as well as contribute to sustainable materials, particularly for rural housing. Since this study was based on a survey, experimental studies of potentials driving the reuse of plastic bottles in housing construction will reveal results that could enable more sustainable housing construction in Nigeria.",2024-11-08,
Combining the pieces: identifying key determinants of export diversification in Africa amidst model uncertainty,"Abstract Export diversification can be a driver of economic growth. Policies to diversify exports attempt to defy an existing comparative advantage in low-value-added goods to promote transformation. Many structural, general policy, and trade-related variables have been identified as important drivers of diversification. This article reviews the literature on the determinants of export diversification and applies Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to empirically tackle model uncertainty stemming from many possible determinants. It assesses the relevance and impact of up to 46 drivers of export diversification for up to 47 African countries and 123 trading partners from 1995 to 2018. It finds that African countries’ structural features are especially influential in determining export diversification, a potential explanation for Africa’s more concentrated export baskets compared to other world regions. Furthermore, trade policies, like tariffs and regional integration, are critical in promoting export diversification. These findings underscore the AfCFTA’s potential to foster export diversification across African economies. A diverse set of non-trade-related policy variables also significantly affect export diversification. Factors such as institutions, education, service sector, resource rents, financial development, FDI and exchange rate stability are relevant determinants in different settings. Moreover, the analysis shows that whom you trade with is also important for diversification, and that context-specific differences, such as specific regional integration contexts or type of commodity-dependence, matter. The results suggest that the goals to diversify exports at the extensive margin for structural change and the intensive margin to tackle volatility, seem often not achievable via the same policies.",2024-11-06,
Cost of living in Ethiopia: the agricultural commodities market,"Although the Ethiopian government is engaged in a process of modernization and making major financial reforms, there remains lack of solid financial tool that could assist market participants in analyzing the agricultural commodity market positions. Similarly, agricultural policy lacks instruments to shield neither farmers against potential losses induced by reductions in the price of crops they produce nor consumers against the increase in cost of living induced by food price inflation. Accordingly, this study aims to construct a price index for agricultural commodities in Ethiopia. Retail price data for agricultural commodities in five categories: cereals, pulses, oilseeds, root crops, and spices from 2010‑2023 from were collected from the Ethiopian Statistical Service (ESS). The Laspeyres average production quantity weighting index method was used to construct the index. The findings show that prices of agricultural commodities revealed an ever‑increasing trend in all the three regional states and Addis Ababa city administration, despite some variations across the areas. Once the price of a specific crop increases, it is unlikely to decline below its previous average. This persistent and continuing trend in agricultural commodity prices will likely worsen consumers' lives further and generally boost the cost of living in Ethiopia. As a result, the majority of Ethiopians are struggling to afford basic food items.",2024-11-06,
Long-Term Trends in Colombian Market Dynamics: An In-Depth Analysis of Equity Performance,"This study explores the relationship between petroleum market fluctuations and equity performance in Colombia's financial exchange. Employing cutting-edge statistical techniques, particularly Functional Data Analysis, researchers examined daily closing figures for 18 prominent corporations across various sectors from 2018 to 2019. The investigation showed patterns in stock behavior, uncovering three distinct groupings based on market trends. The analysis demonstrated a correlation between crude commodity prices and overall market dynamics. These findings offer insights for investors, policymakers, and financial analysts, potentially enhancing decision-making processes in Colombia's economic landscape. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of emerging market behavior, particularly in economies heavily reliant on natural resource exports.

Tariffs are a necessary backstop of the clean energy transition,"In May 2024, the Biden administration announced the results of a multi-year investigation into whether to extend the Trump administration's hefty tariffs on Chinese products, originally imposed in 2018 under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Biden decided to not only keep most of those tariffs in place, but to expand them to a suite of clean energy products, including electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and solar cells (White House, 2024). Why would an administration that prides itself on being the most climate-friendly in history take steps that could increase the price paid by American consumers for clean energy products? Wouldn't $10,000 Chinese EVs be better for the climate than U.S. models priced at $30,000 or higher? There are three reasons for this course of action. First, tariffs to stabilize a domestic clean energy industry that does exist or can are preferable to carbon taxes or free trade that doesn't or can't. Second, trade between a monopolist and non-monopolist cannot be free and introduces other distortions that may be more significant over the medium to long term. And finally, the specific design of Biden's tariffs minimizes the cost of his strategy, though more can be done to ensure the long-term viability of domestic and global clean energy production. In the sections that follow, we argue why tariffs are a necessary backstop of clean industrial policy. Climate change is a massive market failure, where firms producing carbon emissions generate negative externalities on society at large. Faced with this challenge, most economists agree that pricing emissions is the most efficient way to get fossil fuel-using firms to internalize this externality (see, for example, Metcalf, 2018). Many even agree that it is worthwhile to impose carbon tariffs at the border, both to avoid emissions at home simply migrating abroad (i.e., carbon leakage), and to manage the distributional consequences of home-disfavoring taxation. Taken together, this mix can be seen as creating a carbon market. The only problem: The U.S. political system has not produced such a market, at least nationally. Climate action was largely moribund during the Bush II and Trump administrations. The efforts of the Clinton and Obama administrations that might have led directly or indirectly to carbon pricing were blocked by the U.S. Senate (e.g., Kyoto Protocol and the 2009 Waxman-Markey Act), or structured to be nonbinding so that they would not need Senate ratification (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement; Durney, 2017). Meanwhile, an increasingly hostile judiciary has weakened executive actions on climate, as novel legal doctrines like ""non-delegation"" and ""major questions,"" and the repeal of ""Chevron deference"" have shrunk the space for environmental regulation (Meyer, 2024). In the wake of these repeated failures, a new paradigm emerged—one that centered clean energy industrial policy. An early iteration of this new approach was the Green New Deal, which was debated in a 2021 JPAM Point/Counterpoint, so we need not rehearse those arguments here (Fischer & Jacobsen, 2021; Konisky & Carley, 2021). A more recent iteration was Biden's American Jobs Plan, a portion of which Congress enacted in the form of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Together, these laws correct a market failure by helping firms internalize the positive externality generated by clean energy production. Indeed, the benefit to society at large from decarbonization is almost incalculable (estimates exceed $1.2 quadrillion; Alberti, 2024), while many clean energy ventures pre-IRA struggled to be financially viable (Christophers, 2024). In this perspective, even if the laws cost the taxpayer at the upper bound of trillions of dollars (Goldman Sachs, 2023), it will be a relative bargain. The early evidence from the new U.S. industrial policy regime has been encouraging. The U.S. is on track to meet a substantial share of its Paris commitments; every public dollar is drawing in six from the private sector; and there have been six straight quarters of record-breaking contribution by manufacturing construction to GDP (Boushey & Gallegos, 2024). Actual clean energy investment is up 71% in the 2 years following the IRA relative to the 2 years prior, has now surpassed investment in oil and gas production, and constitutes half of all new investment in the U.S. (Bermel et al., 2024). Seventy-five percent of announced investment is going to counties with below median income, with especially strong growth in communities previously reliant on fossil fuels, and 30% are in counties most adversely impacted by the China Shock (Haskins et al., 2024; Treasury, 2024). This boom is also drawing in foreign direct investment, with an estimated 45% of announced investment in recent years coming from companies headquartered in Japan, South Korea, and other countries (Council of Economic Advisers, 2024). Importantly, lawmakers and implementers have structured these laws to unlock important supply-side inputs like labor and materials. For example, under the refashioned investment tax credit, the amount a company can claim in tax credits starts at 6% of their capital costs, but can go as high as 70% if they pay prevailing wages and maintain union apprenticeship programs for their construction workers, invest in distressed and fossil-dependent communities, and use domestic supply chains (Gearino, 2023). Likewise, the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office and Department of Commerce's CHIPS Programs Office score program applicants more favorably if they have community benefit programs, collective bargaining agreements, and local development strategies (Reynolds, 2024). Early reporting indicates that labor unions, a widely acknowledged lever for reducing income inequality and unlocking economic opportunity, are using the various industrial policy programs to expand their footprint (Pontecorvo, 2024). Clean energy employment increased by 142,000 in 2023, and unionization rates in the industry are 12.4%—double that of the labor force writ large and greater than the entire energy sector for the first time (United States Department of Energy, 2024). This shift in policy practice has coincided with an academic re-examination of industrial policy. Long seen as a second- or third-best solution that ""picked winners,"" scholars increasingly see industrial policy as valuable when systemic problems reach sufficient scale and urgency; have substantial positive externalities, innovation, or coordination failures; or involve particularly thorny distributional concerns (Armitage et al., 2023; Juhász et al., 2023). The climate crisis certainly qualifies on all these grounds. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (2024) estimated that the energy transition will require between $4 and $6 trillion annually globally by 2030. Price volatility in upstream commodities like lithium and copper is disrupting investments in finished products like EVs and vice versa, leading to bottlenecks (Moerenhout et al., 2023). The clean energy transition will cause inter-regional labor market disruptions that will rival or surpass the China Shock (Hanson, 2023). And political scientists argue that industrial policy is superior to pricing approaches in creating coalitions of climate action winners to take on blockers, creating a basis for policy credibility and longevity (Meckling & Nahm, 2022; Mildenberger, 2020). The 301 tariffs are a relatively cheap, readily available way to safeguard the economic viability of these bargain-rate investments (both for the taxpayer and industry), similar to the way carbon tariffs at the border protect the integrity of carbon prices behind it. An increasingly aggressive and monopoly-oriented Chinese economic model is taking climate policy further away from a market-oriented trajectory. Contrary to those of neoclassical economic models, extant global clean energy markets are not ones of perfect competition. Risks posed by China's upstream and downstream dominance in clean energy supply chains are not only economic ones, but consequential matters of national security. This dominance did not rise from market forces, but rather from extensive government intervention—financial and otherwise—that far dwarf (and threaten) U.S. public investments and tariff protection. Clean energy supply chains are extremely concentrated. China's share of solar panel manufacturing is greater than 80% (International Energy Agency, 2022), and it controls between 59 and 72% of refining and processing for critical minerals required for EV batteries (Cheng et al., 2024). Market forces did not drive this accumulation: China has made extensive use of subsidies and other far reaching interventions over decades. In 2019, China's industrial policy spending amounted to $407 billion, and since 2009, nearly $230 billion in financial support and tax incentives for the EV market have propelled market share expansion (DiPippo et al., 2022; Kennedy, 2024). China's industrial subsidies are 10 times those of the United States, Germany, Brazil, and Japan. State-owned enterprises receive an outsized share of these subsidies, especially through government procurement channels (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2023). All the while, China is primarily producing to export. China's battery and solar production is already between 2 and 3 times projected global demand. Export volumes have ballooned, increasing 11.5% between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024, especially in EVs, solar, and semiconductors (Shambaugh, 2024). Between 2018 and 2023, Chinese EV exports increased by 1,016% (Coffin & Walling, 2024). As a result of this overcapacity, export prices have plummeted. A combination of labor repression, lax environmental regulation, and subsidization of otherwise unviable business practices means that low price tags like a $10,000 EV or a 11 cents per watt solar module made in China obscure the true cost of production. This threatens the ability for manufacturers not propped up by China's subsidies to exist, much less compete. By suppressing domestic demand, it shuts off potential markets for U.S. and emerging economies' exports and floods the globe with excess supply (Boullenois & Jordan, 2024; Klein & Pettis, 2020). While World Trade Organization (WTO) enforcement or reactive trade remedies, like anti-dumping or countervailing duties, are serviceable when trading partners deviate slightly from market norms, they've proven ineffectual at disciplining China's major deviations. The 301 tariffs, thus, serve several primary functions at ameliorating the effects of monopoly presence in clean energy markets (Pancotti et al., 2024). First, they reduce price distortions. Second, they provide a temporary cushion for domestic infant industries until they are able to scale enough to be internationally competitive. Third, they reduce national security risks by combating China's strategy of monopolization for geopolitical gain (Doshi, 2023; Naughton & Boland, 2023). Combined with industrial policy incentives, the 301s create more robust, competitive, and resilient domestic and global supply chains. Finally, it's worth noting that the tariffs—along with IRA and CHIPS provisions that encourage buying supplies domestically and from allies, rather than from China—also serve a political credibility function. Domestic concerns over Chinese competition have helped derail previous U.S. attempts to address the climate crisis. In 1997, by a unanimous vote, the U.S. Senate indicated disapproval of the U.S. joining the Kyoto Protocol, which would have set binding emissions reductions targets and paved the way for carbon pricing (as it did in Europe; Grubb, 2004), unless it also bound China and other developing countries. A few years later, after negotiations finished, President Bush (2001) concurred that the Senate's worries had been realized and shelved efforts at ratification. President Trump (2017) framed his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in virtually identical terms, citing unfair Chinese competition. For its part, the Obama administration actually managed to get a $90 billion green industrial policy package into the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act's (ARRA; Romer, 2010). But Obama removed domestic content requirements at the behest of U.S. trading partners (Lee, 2009), and industries that received investments proceeded to offshore production to China and elsewhere. Moreover, fierce Chinese competition also tanked ARRA's $535 million investment in solar manufacturer Solyndra. The combination tainted green industrial policy in the U.S. for a decade (Nahm, 2021). By 2016, Obama backed off the WTO's Environmental Goods Agreement (which would have promoted free trade in green products) over concerns that China was seeking unfair dominance in those markets (Reinsch et al., 2021). Nonetheless, while industrial subsidies hold the promise of lowering costs to energy consumers, tariffs could raise them. Luckily, the Biden administration is showing itself adept at managing some of the trade-offs inherent in its industrial strategies. Domestic content and friend-shoring requirements phase in gradually, and can be adjusted based on material availability. Some of the section 301 tariffs—like those on graphite—do not phase in immediately, allowing Chinese sourcing while domestic capacity is established. Others, like those on electric vehicles, are high and immediate, but on products that Americans do not currently import much of. A final category including lithium-ion batteries phases in now with mid-sized tariffs. And this is before we even get to the tariff exclusion process, which the government has used to address hiccups in implementation for projects or firms experiencing particular hardships. Taken together, Biden's tariff actions should be seen as prospective market shaping, not a penalty on existing consumption patterns. Still, more can be done to ensure that industrial policy and tariffs put U.S. firms on a pathway to surviving, decarbonizing, and eventually competing globally. An IRA 2.0 could enhance state capacity by learning from best practices in other countries' industrial policies (Tucker et al., 2024). Sectoral trade agreements can open up trade with allies in low-carbon steel, critical minerals, and other sectors (Mulholland et al., 2024). More nimble financing and stockpiling tools can help create new partnerships with the Global South (Deese, 2024). And, provided it is able to keep its own policy regime intact, the U.S. should never give up on efforts to coordinate with China on climate and establish carbon pricing if and when credible opportunities arise.

Strategy of Derivatives Hedging: Maintaining and Increasing Firm Value amidst Market Volatility in Indonesia,"This study examines the relationship of derivative hedging and firm value. With 1520 observations from 380 Indonesian non-financial firms. The research method used is quantitative explanatory with regression analysis panel data. We involved eight control variables to adjust the influence of external factors. We found that the application of derivative hedging strategies contributes to an increase in the firm value through risk reduction. We also found that commodity derivatives and currency derivatives play a more active role as risk tools than interest rate derivatives. In the context of economic uncertainty and high market fluctuations, firms are exposed to various financial risks, including currency and commodity risks. By implementing an effective hedging strategy, the firm can reduce cash flow volatility and increase financial stability. In addition, reducing uncertainty through risk management can improve investor perception and lower the cost of capital. This result is in line with the principle of Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958) that the firm value is determined by the resulting cash flow. Thus, the practice of risk management is not only relevant but can also reinforce the propositions of Modigliani &amp; Miller (1958) in a more realistic and specific context. The findings underscore the importance of proactive risk management in the face of dynamic market challenges. In addition, this study provides new insights into hedging practices in developing countries. With a better understanding of the impact of using derivatives, firms can manage risk more efficiently and increase their attractiveness in the eyes of investors. So that firm managers can plan the use of derivative instruments as an effective hedging strategy.",2024-11-05,
Significance and Consequence of Cryptocurrency,"On the network, cryptocurrency expands across massive machines. The decentralization approach is constructive for transmitting money more quickly and affordably in cryptocurrencies. Decentralization is a significant benefit of cryptocurrencies. A degree of economic equality is therefore created. Investments in cryptocurrencies are more advantageous. Using cryptographic algorithms, digital resources include cryptocurrencies. Different forms of cryptocurrencies are classified. The most well-known cryptocurrency is, without a doubt, Bitcoin (BTC), even though everyone has since appeared. It contains stablecoins, a cryptocurrency whose value is tied to something resembling a fiat currency, and debt paper, whose value is tied to commodities that resemble gold—a unique chance in finance history. Cryptocurrencies are primarily innovative and disruptive in the financial sector. Increased volatility in the stock market is a significant effect of cryptocurrencies. It is erratic, and the values change as well. Additionally, it causes stock values to fluctuate. One of the digital assets is crypto assets. No one can access our money until they have the private key to our crypto wallet. Once we forget or lose our key, no one will refund our money to us. The cryptocurrency industry in India has undergone a significant transformation, drawing in new investors and upending established structures. Cross-border transactions in economic enterprises are increased by blockchain. The technology was utilized by messaging applications in various ways with private investors. India will no longer retain its position as an offshore economy but rather as an industrial leader. These make a lot of compromises. As a result, (1) India will be enticed to attract international investments, and (2) the industry will create more jobs that will benefit the economy and the young.",2024-11-04,

The main approaches to pricing are considered, with the help of which companies set optimal prices for their services and goods. Factors affecting the company's choice of pricing strategy and affecting consumer behavior are considered. It is conducted research in relation to behavior of consumers and built model of satisfaction of consumer necessities. The purpose of the article. Consideration of pricing strategies of companies and their impact on consumer behavior. Researching consumer behavior and building a model for satisfying consumer needs in goods or services. Methods. Carrying out research the methods of abstraction, analysis, logical, theoretical and historical generalization and comparison are used. For basis of research a dialectical method is taken. Results. The article examines the main approaches to pricing, with the help of which companies set optimal prices for their services and goods. The factors affecting the company's choice of price strategy are considered, and the factors influencing consumer behavior are highlighted. Conducted research on consumer behavior. The proposed model of meeting the needs of consumers in goods or services, which contains 8 sections: the consumer's awareness of the need for the need for a product or service; collection of information; selection of goods or services; decision-making; purchase (payment) of goods or services; evaluation of the choice made and enrichment of experience; the degree of satisfaction of the need for a product or service and consumption of the results. Conclusiоns. After researching and analyzing the available types of marketing price strategies, business entities choose their own price strategy, taking into account certain existing tools, taking into account: characteristics of the service or product, market segment, market competition, competitor analysis, level of market demand, marketing strategies, etc. .. The use of the correct price strategy and the concept of pricing contributes to the achievement of goals: ensuring the stable financial condition of the business entity, meeting the needs of consumers. The offered model in relation to satisfaction of necessities of consumers in commodities or services gives understanding to the process of making decision by consumers in relation to a purchase that is the basic factor of success of company in a competition environment. Companies, that is able to adapt oneself to the necessities of consumers and, to their requirements, that understand the customers, have more chances to retain and attract clients, promote a competitiveness and score a success at the market. The question of the method of determining prices for certain types of services and the behavioral reaction of consumers requires further research.",2024-11-03,
ANALYSIS OF RISK IN THE LIVESTOCK OF THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO AND BRAZIL BETWEEN JANUARY 2007 AND MARCH 2020,"The article aims to analyze the exposure to risks that livestock farmers in the state of Rio de Janeiro face to Brazil using the Value at Risk (VaR) metric as a measure of risk and price return for cattle from January 2007 to March 2020, providing an expanded information that allows for presenting the level of risk of the activity between the analyzed states and comparing their levels. Through this metric, it is possible to have the total volume of losses that can occur for different types of assets and portfolios, including commodities. The results showed that ranchers in the state of Rio de Janeiro are exposed to a greater probability of financial losses when compared to other Brazilian ranchers. While in the state of Rio de Janeiro there is a 95% probability of finding maximum losses in investment of 4.81%, in Brazil the maximum losses were 3.09% for the 95% statistical confidence level. Finally, the non-parametric VaR metric of historical simulation proved to be a valuable tool in the risk management of livestock.",2024-11-03,
Basic Concepts of Stock Option Pricing Models Traded in the Capital Market,"An option, in the world of capital markets, is a right based on an agreement to buy or sell a commodity, financial securities, or a foreign currency at an agreed price at any time within a three-month contract period. Factors that determine the value of an option include the current price of the stock, intrinsic value, expiration time or time value, volatility, interest rate, and cash dividends paid. Some options pricing models use this parameter to determine the fair market value of an option. This paper aims to learn the basic concepts of option pricing. The method used in studying the pricing of options is a literature review, which is an activity to collect scientific data, especially in the form of theories, methods, or research that has been carried out previously, either in the form of books, manuscripts, journals, and others that already exist in the library. Based on the results of the study, concepts, scientific findings, and method innovations that have been achieved previously are obtained, which are very relevant and useful for understanding the determination of stock option prices.

DIRECTIONS OF ENSURING EFFICIENT ACTIVITIES OF FAMILY FORMS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,"In modern conditions, the issues of ensuring the effective functioning of small forms of economic activity are of great importance for the effective functioning of rural areas in social and economic and administrative aspects. In this regard, there is a need to substantiate effective models of economic activity for family forms of agricultural production. These issues are especially relevant for new regions of the Russian Federation. In the course of the study, it was established that peasant farms of Zaporozhye region, included in the cooperative, are differentiated by commodity. Representatives of the commodity group are the least numerous, but they use more than 50% of the total area of agricultural land. In order to improve the efficiency of using the resource potential, increase the number of commodity-type farms and improve the level of well-being of their members, it was proposed to optimize the structure of land use. The proposed land use structure is as follows: cherries - 48%, apricots - 15%, other fruits - 7%, potatoes - 21%, tomatoes - 5%, other crops - 4% of the total volume of agricultural land. Practical implementation of the proposed recommendations will reduce labor costs by 32.7%, but at the same time financial costs increase by 71.4%. Reducing the labor intensity of agricultural production increases the attractiveness of this model for family forms of farming. According to the research results, an increase in the conditional level of profitability by 269 points, as well as the level of family income by 16.2% is noted, which proves the social effect of the implementation of this project for residents of rural areas. A scientifically substantiated model of mutually beneficial cooperation of family forms of agricultural production is an incentive for their participation in the activities of cooperative integration entities.",2024-11-01,
On Prospecting,"Abstract In its narrow sense, prospecting is defined as the search for mineral deposits with a view to exploit them for financial gain. In the last few decades, this definition has been expanded to include bioprospecting, in which genetic resources are transformed into proprietary knowledge, frequently at the expense of communities who have cultivated this knowledge over generations. Prospecting is therefore inescapably extractive, but insofar as it involves a gamble on the profitability of a resource in the future, it is also inherently speculative. Taking recent discussions of the “extractive view” as its starting point, this article focuses on the role of visual culture in prospecting. It investigates how the search for resources generates a visual culture of prospecting and a visual culture about prospecting, whether through aerial views of resource frontiers, spectacular images that attract venture capital, or “specimen views” that isolate objects of economic interest. Tracing a path from the nineteenth-century survey photographs of Timothy O’Sullivan to contemporary work by the likes of Edith Morales and the group On-Trade-Off, it demonstrates how artists repurpose and diversify the visual culture of prospecting, documenting the forces at play in the struggle over lithium extraction or investigating the methods by which genetic raw materials are turned into patentable commodities.",2024-11-01,
"The sustainable economic value of agroforestry products in community forest areas in Suka Tendel Village, Tiga Nderket District, Karo Regency, North Sumatra Province","Abstract Most of agroforestry products are non-timber forest products which are a source of income for communities around the forest. Suka Tendel Village is a village located in a Community Forest area which has various agroforestry commodities. This research aims to identify the potential agroforestry product and annual crops, determine the ability of variables (age, education, length of farming, land area, number of types, number of stems, and capital) in explaining the variable income of farmer groups in the Social Forestry management area in Suka Tendel Village. The method used is the observation and survey method by interviewing members of active farmer groups, then continuing with analyzing the data using financial feasibility analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. Based on the research results, 4 species agroforestry commodities and 7 species of annual crop commodities were found. The ability of the independent variables (age, education, length of farming, land area, number of types, number of plants and capital) simultaneously to explain income at Gundaling farmer is 48.7% with the remaining 51.3% being influenced by other variables.",2024-11-01,
Cost of delivering childhood RSV prevention interventions to the health system in Kenya: a prospective analysis,"Objectives To evaluate the cost of delivering childhood respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prevention interventions to the health system in Kenya. Design A prospective (cost projection) activity-based costing study. Setting Kenya, national introduction of interventions. Participants Not applicable. Interventions A single-dose RSV maternal vaccine and a single-dose, long-acting monoclonal antibody (mAb). Primary and secondary outcome measures Cost per eligible target population; cost per dose administered; non-commodity cost of delivery. Costs are reported in 2023 USD. Results RSV interventions are expected to be delivered using existing systems: maternal vaccine using the antenatal care platform and the mAb delivered similar to existing birth dose vaccines. Assuming a price of US$3 per dose (for both interventions) and baseline coverage rates averaging 50% for the maternal vaccine and 86% for the mAb, the estimated cost of delivering maternal vaccine was US$1.74 (financial) and US$6.60 (economic) per vaccinated woman, and the cost of delivering mAbs was US$1.56 (financial) and US$6.27 (economic) per vaccinated child. Excluding commodity cost, the cost of delivering maternal vaccine was US$1.32 (financial) and US$2.72 (economic) and that for mAb was US$1.23 (financial) and US$2.48 (economic). Cost differences between the two interventions are driven by the anticipated baseline coverage. Health worker training, service delivery and programme planning and coordination were major cost drivers. Conclusion This study presents the prospective cost of new RSV intervention introduction and delivery in low-income and middle-income country settings, which is largely unknown. Cost estimates incorporate anticipated health system strengthening activities needed to deliver the future RSV interventions. These cost estimates support country-level and global-level decision-makers evaluating implementation feasibility and intervention affordability.",2024-11-01,
Stabilizing Asset Prices Through Transition from Continuous Trading to Electronic Auctions,"Abstract This chapter analyzes a core component of what is defined in this volume as Permacrisis, namely, the pattern of asset price dynamics as a sequence of “bull markets” and “bear markets.” Based on this analysis, a new concept for stabilizing the “long swings” of asset prices is elaborated, namely, replacing continuous asset trading with electronic auctions. First, I sketch the channels through which the “overshooting” of exchange rates, commodities prices, and stock prices but also of EU carbon prices dampens the real economy and hampers fighting global heating. Second, a theoretical alternative to the still dominating “efficient market hypothesis” is presented, the “bull-bear-hypothesis.” Third, I discuss the role of “technical” or “algorithmic” trading strategies in exploiting short-term asset price trends and strengthening them at the same time. Fourth, it is shown that bulls (bear) markets result from (very) short-term trends (“runs”) in line with the prevailing (bullish or bearish) market sentiment lasting longer than counter-movements. Fifth, to mitigate the extent of the “long swings” of asset prices one needs to restrict (super) fast speculation unrelated to market fundamentals, thereby dampening the short-term trending of asset prices. Instead of implementing a financial transactions tax, one could achieve this objective also by replacing continuous trading with electronic auctions, for example, every 3 h. This approach is theoretically more appealing, technically easy to implement, and has so far not seriously been discussed.",2024-10-31,
Konfrontasi Rusia-Ukraina: Bagaimana Pengaruhnya Pada Reaksi Pasar dan Kinerja Saham Sub Sektor Mining?,"This research aims to empirically demonstrate the divergence of capital market responses measured by abnormal returns, trading volume, volatility of security returns, and stock performance measured by returns in the mining subsector listed on the IDX due to the Russia-Ukraine war. This research is vital because geopolitical conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine War affect financial markets, especially commodity-dependent sectors, thus providing insights for investors and policymakers in the face of uncertainty. Using an event study method for 10 days pre-and post-war, this research used 29 companies with paired sample t-tests in the hypothesis testing. This study is the first to combine the four variables AR, TVA, SRV, and R to analyze the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, thus becoming a novelty in this research.

Predicting Gold Prices Through Machine Learning with Economic Indicators and Feature Selection Methods,"The enormous fluctuation of the gold price in international markets gives predictive analysis an indispensable place for business firms, economists, and investors. With this in mind, this research aims to construct a machine learning model for gold price prediction based on past information and identify some leading patterns affecting the prices of such a commodity. The model thus covers a range of related financial and economic factors, be it past gold prices and inflation metrics, oil price vagaries, worldwide market indexes, and interest rate movements. Using machine learning algorithm approaches like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, as well as Linear Regression approaches, the system is set to identify complex relationships prevailing in the data and provides predictions for short-term movements and long-term movements concerning price. The model will be trained and validated using historical data that includes the history of the gold price. In this respect, the findings of the study are relevant to stakeholders in financial forecasting who could make informed investment decisions. Additionally, the paper has outlined the method for feature selection that determines which factors are dominant in explaining the fluctuation of the gold price. The goal of the model, therefore, is to enhance its performance through prediction accuracy reduction in noise, recursive elimination of features, and application of correlation analysis. As a result, a robust evaluation of several machine algorithms, including support vector machines, allows the selection of a suitable model that best solves the prediction task. This approach to forecasting will therefore aid in the creation of instruments for risk management, automated trading techniques, and financial strategies for an individual as well as for organizations. Keywords: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, machine learning, and gold price prediction; economic indicators, feature selection, and linear regression in the field of financial forecasting; erratic behaviour; and risk management.",2024-10-30,
A study on differences in economic and social structure between education and food production,"Education and food are vital commodities, yet their economic and social structures differ greatly. Food production requires private enterprise to maintain financial efficiency, while education relies on the government to maximize social efficiency. This paper examines the rationale behind disparities in the distribution of education and food production sectors through the lens of economic efficiency, accessibility and informed public decision-making. Education has positive externalities, promoting social cohesion by teaching shared values, stabilizing the functioning of society and achieving social and educational equity through the participation of an educated population in democratic processes. Private food production can maintain the ability to minimize costs and maximize product quality through market competition. In addition, private companies are better equipped to take on the significant risks associated with agribusiness. Competition and technological innovation in the food industry have made prices accessible, ensuring that essential nutrients are affordable to low-income and vulnerable groups. Public education can also have a positive impact on food production. Public education promotes the long-term development of the food industry by training relevant agricultural talents to carry out technological innovations related to food production. In addition, educated citizens are more likely to be concerned about food safety and its production process—the demand for food transparency and quality forces food producers to adhere to higher standards and innovate. Thus, rationalizing distribution and interaction between the education and food production sectors results in optimal social outcomes.",2024-10-29,
Beyond money,"In Essay sur le don Marcel Mauss described a system of exchange in Maori society whereby ""gifts"" circulated without the mediation of a currency. He believed that the key to this form of exchange lay with the hau, a spirit that, while inhering in the object, created a sense of obligation for the recipient to pass it on. This model does not differ in essence from the belief in classic Economics that exchange value inheres in the commodity. In both instances, the social relations of the respective societies are projected onto the objects of exchange, which then seem to take a life of their own. Firstly, this chapter investigates different anthropological interpretations of pre-economic ""economies"", with a special focus on Pierre Clastres' reading of the special, intangible quality of gifts as a way of withdrawing exchange value from goods when they enter the sphere of power in order to limit political power whose expansion would ultimately threaten social cohesion. Secondly, it reads the contemporary disengagement of the financial economy from the classic economy of production and exchange against this backdrop: A threat to society from unfettered exchange value could be seen in the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2008, a systemic failure triggered by the velocity of exchanges far exceeding the possibility of maintaining a promissory relation with the initial exchange. If in Clastres's account, the South American Indigenous people designed ways to confine the political authority by removing exchangeability from the values showered upon it, today's virtual economy of autonomous value, relieved from correspondence to tangible commodities and physical marketplaces, may end up removing the political from society.",2024-10-29,
Enablers and barriers of community health programs for improved equity and universal coverage of primary health care services: A scoping review,"Community health programs (CHPs) are integral components of primary health care (PHC) systems and support the delivery of primary care and allied health and nursing care services. CHPs are necessary platforms for delivering health services toward universal health coverage (UHC). There are limited prior studies on comprehensive evidence synthesis on how CHPs strengthen community health systems for the demand and supply of PHC services. Therefore, this scoping review synthesized existing evidence on the interlinkage between CHPs and the community health system and beyond for delivering and utilising PHC services toward UHC. We conducted a scoping review of research articles on CHPs. We identified research articles in six databases (PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Embase) and Google Scholar using search terms under three concepts: CHPs, PHC, and UHC. Of the 3836 records identified, 1407 duplicates were removed, and 2346 were removed based on titles and abstracts. A total of 83 articles were eligible for the full-text review; of them, 18 articles were removed with reasons, and the other 16 were included through hand search. Themes were identified and explained using Sacks and colleagues' ""Beyond the Building Block"" framework. A total of 81 studies were included in the final review. Studies described CHPs as foundations for community health system readiness for PHC services, including decentralization in the health sector, community-controlled governance, resource mobilization, ensuring health commodities (e.g., through community pharmacies), and information evidence. These foundational inputs mediate the actions of CHPs by partnership with community organizations and health workforces (e.g., community health workers). CHPs contributed to improved access to health services by providing health services in public health emergencies, affordable and comprehensive care, and modifying social determinants of health. CHPs are platforms for implementing and delivering PHC services close to communities. They help to modify social determinants of health, promote health and wellbeing, reduce care costs, prevent disease progression, and reduce hospitalisation rates. CHPs are integral parts of community health systems and require investment to improve access to PHC services. Gaps and challenges of CHPs include inadequate funding, limited engagement of the private sector, poor quality of health services, and limited focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Further implementation research is needed to mitigate the burden of NCDs. Health systems efforts focus on increasing resources (e.g., financial and human) required in CHPs to ensure the quality of PHC services provided through CHPs toward better service access, and reaching the unreached and achieve equity and universality of PHC services.",2024-10-29,
A cross-sectional study on the key risk factors affecting farmers’ mental health,"Background: Amidst fluctuating commodity prices and disrupted processing methods, farmers face escalating costs, including healthcare and property taxes. Disturbingly, the suicide rate among farmers is 3.5 times higher than that of the general population. This study addressed the critical gap in understanding the key risk factors influencing farmers’ mental health. The study aimed to identify the risk factors affecting farmers’ mental health, explore the root causes of their depression and anxiety, and provide essential management education tailored for them. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 153 farmers, collecting demographic details and conducting interviews to assess their financial status, health, and years of farming experience. Education on managing stress and anxiety was provided as part of the intervention. Results: From January to October 2023, 153 farmers (120 males, 30 females) were interviewed. Of these, 95 reported experiencing depression, with varying degrees of severity: 30.9% mild, 22.1% moderate, 10.1% moderate to severe, and 2% severe. The age group most affected was 36–50 years. Key risk factors identified were financial stress, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Conclusions: The study underscored significant public health concerns, revealing that factors such as age, working hours, and financial stress critically impact farmers’ mental health. Poor self-care, neglect of medical advice, and high rates of comorbidities among farmers highlight the need for targeted health interventions. Educating farmers on stress management and regular medical care is essential for improving their overall well-being, sustaining the agricultural workforce, and ensuring food security.",2024-10-29,

A Study on the Dependency Between Selected Global Stock Markets and Gold and Silver Futures,"Globalization has enabled greater volume and frequency of economic and commercial practices to be implemented worldwide. As a result, with the expansion of the scope of capital expansion, the interdependence of financial markets increases. However, negative developments such as economic crises, epidemics, wars, and uncontrolled migrations cause the relations between markets to weaken and a significant number of investors to turn to commodity investments. This study aims to evaluate the validity of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) theorem, which posits that the expected returns of financial assets are influenced by systematic and unsystematic risks within the context of the selected market data for the specified period. Specifically, the study seeks to analyze the potential cointegration and the effects of gold and silver futures returns on the returns of selected global stock markets using time-series analysis. The potential relationships between the monthly returns of selected global stock indices and the monthly returns of gold and silver futures were analyzed for the period from January 2014 to May 2024 using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bound Test method. By calculating the error correction coefficients, it has been determined how long it takes to restore the balance in case the balance between the stock markets and commodity markets is disrupted. As a result of the research, it was determined that there is a long-term cointegration relationship between gold and silver futures index returns and selected global stock index returns. In the case of a short-term imbalance in the relationship between the yields of selected global indices and the index returns of gold and silver-term transactions, the balance was recovered within 0.9042 months for the index return of gold-term operations and 0.6549 months for the index return of silver-term operations.",2024-10-28,
"Uneven connections: A partial history of the mobile phone in Papua New Guinea By Robert J.Foster. Canberra: <scp>ANU</scp> press. 2024. pp. xvi + 221, notes, figures, bibliography, index. <scp>AU</scp>$59.99. <scp>ISBN</scp> 9781760466251 &lt;https://press.anu.edu.au/publications/series/pacific/uneven‐connections&gt;","Robert Foster, well known for his groundbreaking work on commodity consumption and nation-building in Papua New Guinea (PNG), has made another major contribution to this fascinating topic. In earlier work, he opened our eyes to the impact of the marketing of products like Coca-Cola on the national imaginary. Uneven Connections now offers a fascinating account of the early 21st-century arrival and development of digital communication technology in this hothouse corner of the Pacific. The book basically argues how utopian expectations—that mobile phones would result in 'national simultaneity' and 'infrastructural citizenship' (p. 183)—crashed into pre-digital realities and left an 'uneven mediascape' (p. 48) behind, rather than a total transformation either of society in general or the citizen-subject in particular. In 2007, the Digicel Company, headquartered in Jamaica, but owned and operated by Denis O'Brien, an Irish billionaire, entered the PNG market which it came to more or less monopolise for the next 15 years, before it was sold off to Telstra of Australia. In this brief interval, Foster notes, mobile phones became 'normalised' in PNG cities, where they entirely replaced pay phones. This is the lively 'ethnographic present' of Uneven Connections that Foster examines with analytical acuity and a flair for an effective illustration. Harking back to his earlier work, he is at his best when discussing how Digicel billboards and newspaper ads, in which mobile phones were attributed the power to create a new, inclusive community. Promoting itself as an egalitarian company, Digicel sought to deliver service to remote areas, thus allowing universal access to modernity. It also sponsored national sports teams and offered small amounts of credit from time to time, as well as 'call-me' texts and voicemail retrieval features at no charge, and free night-time calling. In a 'moral economy' derived from their own values and concepts of the good and the just, Papua New Guineans invented workarounds, such as deliberate 'missed calls' by hanging up after two rings, or other pre-arranged signals, so kin or friends might call back (and pay). Although the evidence he presents is somewhat thin on this point, Foster also claims that Digicel's prepaid format, requiring the purchase of credit units from street vendors or others, gave rise to individual discipline in order to manage usage. The phones became a kind of technological Benjamin Franklin in early American capitalism by promoting a 'sense of time thrift' and an association of time to money (p. 87). In a concise but thorough survey of the literature on the relationship between mobile phones and pre-digital culture across PNG, Foster cites, among several other examples, the famous case of an upper Sepik River people trying to call deceased kin in the afterlife. Credit requests, which were granted to close kin, followed pre-existing gender and kinship hierarchies. Texting resembled gift exchange in which receiving a text obliged a reply (especially between couples). Expectations that mobile telephony would benefit economic production and support new forms of entrepreneurship did not pan out. In Goroka town, where Foster himself conducted some research, street vendors sold phone credit and handsets, and offered repair services. As a result, a black market of pickpocketed phones arose. Pre-capitalist values prevailed among them, however. Vendors did not engage in price competition, looked out for each other, and even received gifts of food from customers. Smartphones began to be widely adopted in PNG, particularly when Digicel promoted sales, erected new towers and upgraded the network so consumers could watch the 2015 Pacific Games that were staged in Port Moresby. As this happened, a shift occurred from voice and texting to data use. People began posting on Facebook and accessing streamed television news, entertainment and radio. A new dimension of the digital divide thus emerged with smartphones; data were consumed in cities and towns in PNG but rather less so in rural settings. Street vendors also suffered as phone credit became available online via linked bank accounts. Foster does not ignore the negative impacts of digital technology on society. Phones 'disrupted' the distinction between public and domestic relations. 'Phone friendships', which involved a kind of intimacy-at-a-distance between complete strangers who initially called each other basically at random but then started relationships, arose. More broadly, as phone numbers often failed to match callers' identities, a level of mistrust about calls increased. The government sought to develop a program of SIM card registration in order to eliminate 'unknown numbers' in 2013. A law was eventually passed in 2020, but had no impact. Increased access to social media and news on smartphones moved political culture into a 'new mediascape' but due to a lack of governmental accountability and effectiveness, this shift gave rise to cynicism that Foster called a 'resigned political discourse' (p. 158) rather than a new mode of social action. Delivering services to consumers that Foster characterises as 'post-political', the Digicel Foundation partnered with the PNG state to build classrooms, provide disaster and pandemic assistance, financial services and infrastructure, as well as a moral vision of financial inclusion and individual self-sufficiency. At first, the arrival of Digicel phones did increase the sense of a 'national space–time', and the company enjoyed 'universal affection' across the country (p. 183). However, by 2017, PNG had become divided. Urban and rural sectors were 'out of sync' and involuntarily disconnected (p. 184). When Telstra bought Digicel in 2022, the goal of 'national coevalness' (p. 185) based in a private, digital infrastructure was no more than an 'incomplete' project at best (p. 186). One does not get a sense of inconclusion from this book, however. Foster's history of mobile telephony in PNG is comprehensive. It exhausts existing literature to which he has added his own, fresh research. Not at all in thrall of technology, or the expectation that its putative rationality will inevitably spread and resolve all problems, this narrative of the first decades of digital communication in PNG is at once complicated and captivating.",2024-10-28,
ANALYSIS OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IN SHOPPING CHANNEL PREFERENCES IN A DUAL CHANNEL SUPPLY CHAIN STRUCTURE,"Physical stores and online stores are one way that companies can continue to survive amidst competition by increasing profits from these two channels. Clothing is one of the textile commodities that is widely traded through physical stores and also online stores. This research identifies the factors that have the most significant influence on consumer preferences in choosing physical stores or online stores. Determining the factors involved adopts the results of previously conducted research. Based on existing research, there are several factors, namely Financial Risk (FR), Performance Risk (PerR), Psychological Risk (PsyR), Perceived Risk (PR), Environment Quality (EQ), Service Quality (SQ), Internet Experience (IE ), and Switching Intention (SI). From these variables, 8 hypotheses were formed. All hypotheses from the model were processed using Structural Equation Modeling with SmartPLS 3 software, it was found that H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H7 were accepted. H6 and H8 are rejected.",2024-10-28,
Reflections of Economic Shocks and Price of Crude Oil on Gold Price Volatility within Asian Nations,"The focus of this study is to examine the effects of economic shocks along with the crude oil price on gold prices in Asian countries. This study utilizes a regression analysis to measure the relationship between the macroeconomic indicators, crude oil price, and gold price in six selected nations from 1990 until 2022. The validity of the data was diagnostically checked by performing a VIF procedure, autocorrelation test, and normality test on residual, and data were analyzed via EViews software. The analysis showed mixed findings, however, a major variable that positively affects the fluctuation of the gold price is “the crude oil price” and it reflects global economic stability in the six countries. A sudden rise in crude oil prices might trigger conflicts in oil-exporting countries and limit access to material sources. This situation may force investors to move their funds into a safe-haven commodity like gold. The fluctuations in crude oil prices are not only a response to current market conditions but also alarming a lot more fundamental problems in an economy, which include approaching economic recessions, currency devaluation and a major financial crisis. For practical implications, this study suggests that policymakers pay extra attention to this commodity besides other economic indicators like inflation, interest and currency rates, and a GDP rate to ensure a sustainable economic condition. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first that examines the economic shocks along with crude oil prices pre-and-post COVID-19 pandemic focusing on a few Asian countries.",2024-10-27,
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE,"International finance explores the monetary and economic relationships between countries, covering exchange rates, foreign direct investment, trade, and global markets. Its history traces back to ancient trade systems, the rise of banking in medieval times, and key developments like the Bretton Woods conference and the establishment of the IMF and World Bank. Today, globalization and technological advancements have reshaped the field, while events like the 2008 financial crisis highlight market interconnectedness. Global financial markets, including stocks, bonds, forex, and commodities, drive economic activities, with central banks playing a crucial role in stabilizing currencies and economies. Global investing involves allocating capital across international markets to diversify portfolios, reduce risk, and take advantage of global growth opportunities. Key strategies include geographic and asset class diversification, using investment vehicles like mutual funds or ETFs, and managing currency risk through hedging. Cross-border financial management, crucial for multinational companies, requires addressing challenges such as exchange rate volatility, diverse tax systems, regulatory differences, and liquidity management. MNCs employ strategies like foreign exchange hedging, centralized treasury management, and tax optimization to navigate these complexities and enhance financial efficiency.",2024-10-27,
"The Causal Relationship Between Stocks, Gold, Crude Oil, and Bond Returns in Poland","Theoretical background: Capital investments involve taking risks to achieve a favourable rate of return. Investors are offered various options, including stocks, bonds, and commodities. The aforementioned investment opportunities are considered alternatives due to their varying price volatility and risk levels. Bonds and gold demonstrate a low or negative correlation with equities. On the other hand, crude oil and gold are positively correlated. An essential issue in analysing financial markets is to capture the dynamic behaviour of the financial time-series data, i.e. variables such as prices and returns on investments in assets mentioned above. In decision-making, investors should consider the causal relationship between asset classes, as some variables may contain important information about the future dynamics of other variables. The ability to predict future outcomes is crucial to reduce uncertainty. Vector autoregression (VAR) models are regarded as a useful modelling tool in investigating interrelations between financial instrument prices and returns. Purpose of the article: The paper aims to evaluate the linkages between stock, gold, crude oil, and bond returns in Poland. We focus on analysing both the long term equilibrium between logarithmic financial asset prices and the Granger causality between logarithmic returns in the short term. Research methods: The causal relationships between the stocks, gold, crude oil, and bond logarithmic returns are investigated based on the VAR/VECM estimates. The empirical data cover the period from December 2006 to January 2023. We use the following market data to measure the interrelations between the considered assets: WIG Index, gold and crude oil spot prices, and bond index reflecting the price movements on the Polish financial market. We carry out the test for stationarity employing the ADF and Phillips–Perron tests. The pre-estimation process also involves identifying the number of lags and conducting the Johansen cointegration test since variables are integrated of order one to examine the existence of the long-term equilibrium between the logarithmic prices of assets mentioned above. We use the Wald test for the models’ parameters to indicate the type of Granger causality between logarithmic returns. The forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) and impulse response functions (IRF) analysis is also applied. Moreover, the post-estimation procedure includes a test for parameters stability and white noise of residuals. All calculations are performed using Stata’s standard software package. Main findings: The results suggest that the markets we examined in Poland are cointegrated, meaning a long-term relationship exists between the prices of financial assets. Additionally, we prove that gold logarithmic prices have a negative impact on the stock index, indicating an inverse relationship between their price developments. We also discover that crude oil and bonds’ effects on the stock market are positive. Although all β coefficients of the error correction equation are statistically significant, the short-term adjustment to equilibrium did not occur based on the α coefficients of the short-term equations. According to the Granger causality analysis related to the VAR in first differences, gold price changes have a short-term impact on stock returns. In contrast, stock returns cause crude oil returns. However, we find no causal linkages in the remaining cases, suggesting that the variables are independent. Changes in asset prices are mainly attributed to their shocks, while observed impacts described by IFR function patterns die out quite quickly. Overall, results confirm that investors can combine gold and stocks in their portfolios, as these interrelated assets have alternative investment properties. Additionally, it is worth noting that the correlation between stock returns and crude oil or bonds is undesirable when constructing portfolios.",2024-10-26,
"Modelling the impact of increasing supplementary feed allowance on predicted sheep enterprise production, profit and financial risk across southern Australia","Context Supplementary feeding may alter sheep enterprise production and profit margin, but use may vary across regions, sheep breeds and mating seasons. Supplementary feeding is a means of ensuring adequate nutrition but increases operating costs. Modelling has previously indicated the most profitable sheep enterprises optimise stocking rate and target lamb production, whereas those that minimise supplementary feeding incur the least financial risk. Aims To explore the impact of increasing supplementary feed allowance on production, profit and financial risk. Methods Seventy-two sheep farm enterprises were simulated across eight southern Australian locations, including three breeds and three mating seasons. For each enterprise a low grain allowance (LGA) of 30 kg/head.year (threshold used in previous modelling) was compared to a high grain allowance (HGA) of 35 kg/head.year and 42 kg/head.year for Merino and non-Merino ewes (current industry recommendations), respectively. The financial risk of each enterprise was determined via Conditional Value at Risk of gross margins over 30 years, exploring downside risk in the worst 20% of scenarios. Key results A HGA increased production and profit in 32% of farm enterprises, but financial risk was often increased. Merino enterprises were generally the most profitable, least risky and consumed the greatest amount of supplementary feed, followed by Composite and then Maternal enterprises. Summer and autumn mating was often most profitable, but high supplement consumption in autumn-mated enterprises increased financial risk. Conclusions Increasing supplementary feeding may improve production and profit but may also increase financial risk using the parameters examined. Implications Producers may be able to improve the production, profit and financial risk of an enterprise through increased supplementary feeding, but this will be dependent on breed, input costs, commodity prices and location.",2024-10-24,
Double Auctions: Formalization and Automated Checkers,"Double auctions are widely used in financial markets, such as those for stocks, derivatives, currencies, and commodities, to match demand and supply. Once all buyers and sellers have placed their trade requests, the exchange determines how these requests are to be matched. The two most common objectives for determining the matching are maximizing trade volume at a uniform price and maximizing trade volume through dynamic pricing. Prior research has primarily focused on single-quantity trade requests. In this work, we extend the framework to handle multiple-quantity trade requests and present fully formalized matching algorithms for double auctions, along with their correctness proofs. We establish new uniqueness theorems, enabling automatic detection of violations in exchange systems by comparing their output to that of a verified program. All proofs are formalized in the Coq Proof Assistant, and we extract verified OCaml and Haskell programs that could serve as a resource for exchanges and market regulators. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our work by running the verified program on real market data from an exchange to automatically check for violations in the exchange algorithm.",2024-10-24,
Impact of Russo-Ukrainian War on Global Economy,"Russia's unjustified and barbaric invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sparked a terrible humanitarian disaster and put the stability of international relations in jeopardy. The Russo-Ukrainian war resulted in spillover impacts on world economy, primarily through global supply chain disruption, thereby resulting in surging inflation. As a result of the war, economic concerns of a major slowdown in the global economy, surge in inflation and debt, and increase in poverty have grown. The conflict has had an economic impact on numerous international channels, including commodities and financial markets, trade, migratory links, daily economic life, and trust. The war resulted in a food crisis and soaring oil prices, resulting in imported inflation for oil-importing nations. Different nations had different economic impacts because of this conflict, depending upon their trade quantum with Russia and Ukraine, and propinquity to the war zone. Stock markets in major parts of the world crashed as the war loomed in. A major positive out of the war has been acceleration towards clean energy initiatives by European nations. This study tries to offer insight into how the Russia-Ukraine conflict has affected the global economy, including the Indian economy. Also, the study discusses the effect of this war on the stock markets worldwide and the business implications therein.",2024-10-24,
The importance of financial controls for maximizing results for small rural entrepreneurs,"Brazil's agricultural sector is crucial for the economy and global food security, encompassing about 41% of the country's total land area and housing over 5 million agricultural establishments. According to the Brazilian Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock (CNA), agribusiness contributed 23.8% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2023, highlighting its diverse production of agricultural commodities. While technological advancements have boosted productivity, a significant gap exists between large and small producers. Large producers often benefit from technological progress, whereas small producers—a significant portion of family farming—face substantial challenges. Family farming accounts for 67% of agricultural activity and 80% of global food production, yet it struggles with financial management, lack of knowledge, and limited access to credit and technology. Efficient rural management is essential for optimizing resources, reducing costs, and enhancing productivity on small farms. Implementing financial management practices, such as budgeting, cost analysis, and cash flow control, can help small producers make better use of their resources and lower expenses. Public policies like the National Program for the Strengthening of Family Farming (PRONAF) and the Food Acquisition Program (PAA) aim to support these producers by providing financing and securing markets for their products. Family farming holds significant potential for sustainable practices. With the right support, it can continue to play a vital role in the Brazilian economy and global food security, fostering a sustainable and prosperous future for the agricultural sector.",2024-10-23,

A comprehensive review of treasury management practices and their impact on corporate sustainability in emerging economies: Strategic insights from the oil and gas sector,"Treasury management practices are critical for ensuring financial stability and fostering corporate sustainability, particularly in the volatile oil and gas sector of emerging economies. This comprehensive review examines the relationship between treasury management practices and corporate sustainability, focusing on strategic insights that can be drawn from the oil and gas industry. The review highlights the importance of effective cash management, risk assessment, and liquidity optimization as key components of successful treasury operations. The study categorizes treasury management practices into several essential areas, including cash flow forecasting, working capital management, investment strategies, and risk management frameworks. Each category is analyzed concerning its contribution to corporate sustainability, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that aligns financial objectives with environmental and social considerations. The findings indicate that robust treasury management practices can significantly enhance operational resilience, improve resource allocation, and support long-term sustainability initiatives. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges faced by oil and gas companies in emerging economies, such as economic instability, regulatory uncertainty, and fluctuating commodity prices. These challenges necessitate the adoption of innovative treasury strategies that not only safeguard financial assets but also promote sustainable business practices. By integrating sustainability metrics into treasury decision-making, companies can better manage risks associated with environmental regulations and stakeholder expectations. Additionally, the role of technology in modernizing treasury management is examined, particularly in terms of digital tools and platforms that enhance data analysis and decision-making capabilities. The review underscores the potential for fintech solutions to streamline treasury operations and improve transparency, thereby contributing to enhanced corporate sustainability. In conclusion, this review provides strategic insights into the interplay between treasury management practices and corporate sustainability in the oil and gas sector of emerging economies. The insights presented herein are intended to guide industry practitioners in developing effective treasury strategies that foster sustainable growth while addressing the unique challenges of the emerging market context.",2024-10-19,
Neuro-Symbolic Traders: Assessing the Wisdom of AI Crowds in Markets,"Deep generative models are becoming increasingly used as tools for financial analysis. However, it is unclear how these models will influence financial markets, especially when they infer financial value in a semi-autonomous way. In this work, we explore the interplay between deep generative models and market dynamics. We develop a form of virtual traders that use deep generative models to make buy/sell decisions, which we term neuro-symbolic traders, and expose them to a virtual market. Under our framework, neuro-symbolic traders are agents that use vision-language models to discover a model of the fundamental value of an asset. Agents develop this model as a stochastic differential equation, calibrated to market data using gradient descent. We test our neuro-symbolic traders on both synthetic data and real financial time series, including an equity stock, commodity, and a foreign exchange pair. We then expose several groups of neuro-symbolic traders to a virtual market environment. This market environment allows for feedback between the traders belief of the underlying value to the observed price dynamics. We find that this leads to price suppression compared to the historical data, highlighting a future risk to market stability. Our work is a first step towards quantifying the effect of deep generative agents on markets dynamics and sets out some of the potential risks and benefits of this approach in the future.",2024-10-18,
Partisan Impacts and Determinants for Internationalization of Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Products,"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Background&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;: The pharmaceutical and related commodities manufacturing industry in Ethiopia is long-lived because the country is well-endowed with basic raw materials and local ownership and to some extent with machinery and technological know-how. The pharmaceutical industry, both globally and in Africa, encounters challenges in internationalizing products. In Ethiopia, challenges like regulatory complexities and limited government support hinder international market access for pharmaceutical products. This aim is to explore the barriers and understand why Ethiopian pharmaceuticals struggle to enter global markets. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Method&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;: The study adopted a mixed research approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative methods. It focuses on 15 pharmaceutical industries in Ethiopia, particularly those in Addis Ababa and the Oromia Special Zone, using probability and none probability sampling technique. The total study participants involved in the quantitative and qualitative studies were 373 and 15, respectively. Data collection comprises questionnaires, key informant interviews, and observation checklists, supplemented by secondary data from official and theoretical sources. Ethical considerations underscore obtaining verbal consent and ensuring confidentiality. Analysis entails descriptive statistics and qualitative synthesis, with numerical analysis conducted using STATA 14.1 software. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Results&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;: Out of the expected 384 study participants, 373 (97.13%) participated in our study, while the entire group of participants proposed in the qualitative study (15) also participated in this study. Key findings include resource constraints, regulatory issues, and biased perceptions against local products, hindering their global recognition. While strong political commitment and effective policy enforcement at the top government level are crucial, inadequate collaboration across government tiers undermines these efforts. Despite existing policies, inadequate implementation and procedural guidance diminish industry interest. There&amp;apos;s uncertainty about government support for local pharmaceutical production, with persistent challenges like resource shortages and policy inconsistencies impeding progress. Perceptions vary on the effectiveness of policies promoting local production, and concerns about taxation issues impact the industry. Nevertheless, most respondents’ express confidence in the quality of domestically produced pharmaceuticals. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;: Despite crucial government commitment, weak collaboration across levels impedes progress. Respondents note deficient policy implementation and doubt government support. Persistent issues like resource shortages persist, along with taxation concerns, despite locally produced products being perceived as equal in quality. To advance, better policy implementation, regulatory harmony, financial support, infrastructure enhancement, increased awareness, and improved collaboration are essential.",2024-10-18,
Foreign Direct Investment and Economic Development,"This chapter attempts to examine the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the economic growth and development of the Global South countries, particularly the GS-11. The GS-11 comprises the present BRICS countries, including Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and six recent additions: the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Argentina. Following this expansion, the GS-11 economies will represent approximately half of the world's population and constitute nearly one-third of the global GDP. The economies of the Global South face various challenges, notably with respect to issues of financial stability, multilateral trade, and economic development. In order to address these challenges, FDI could play a significant role. Such investments from abroad provide host nations with much-needed capital, managerial expertise, technology, and access to global markets. Moreover, they play a pivotal role in fostering export-oriented growth. It also enhances a nation's capacity to manufacture exportable commodities and wide-ranging services through technology transfer and knowledge spillovers. Further, it provides the necessary linkages to global value chains, helping to expand market access. To exploit the FDI phenomenon, the policymakers of GS-11 economies need to find an equilibrium between attracting foreign investment and promoting sustainable economic development. Against this backdrop, this chapter uses descriptive tools to examine the multifaceted impact of inward FDI on the economic growth, trade dynamics, and overall development of GS-11 countries. The findings highlight the significance of FDI inflows for the long-term economic growth of developing nations in the Global South.",2024-10-17,
Stock market volatility and commodity prices,"Abstract This paper empirically examines the dynamic relationship between stock market volatility and commodity prices through the time-varying risk aversion channel using daily data between December 31 in 1999 and June 14 in 2021. We employ a time-varying structural-form vector autoregressive model (VAR) model with (aggregate, sectoral and sixteen individual) commodity prices. The results suggest that the transmission mechanism of stock market volatility shocks on the commodity prices change over time. The negative effect of stock market volatility on commodity prices is more statistically significant in the 2008–09 Global Financial Crisis than that during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Further, the effect is greater in energy commodities compared to the agricultural and metals markets. The long-lasting negative effect of risk aversion is stronger compared to that of the expected stock market volatility on the commodity price. The change in the stock-commodity transmission mechanism is likely due to changes in underlying sources of risk aversion and expected uncertainty over time.",2024-10-17,
"Sharia Concepts in Islamic Home Financing Products in Malaysia: An Analysis on Musyarakah Mutanaqisah and the Fiqh Method ""The Original Law of a Contract with Conditions is Required and Legal""","Islamic Financing Products have begun to grow rapidly in the current banking and financial industry. This situation can be seen through the increase in Islamic banking assets every year in addition to the participation of more institutions that offer Islamic products. Islamic housing financing products for example feature the application of sharia concepts such as bay bi Thaman ajil (BBA), commodity BBA, ijarah thuma al bay. BBA is most widely used in offering Islamic housing financing products while the use of other concepts such as musyarakah mutaqisah is still considered new. Musyarakah Mutanaqisah is a hybrid contract based on partnership and ending with sole ownership. This concept began to be applied in banking practice in Malaysia after the year 2000. The main aim of this study is to analyze the fiqh method of Presumption of Validity and Consent Applicable to All Contracts and its application in housing financing. The purpose of this identified method is to see the extent of the contracts used by Islamic banking institutions in safeguarding the interests and benefits of customers when purchasing housing. This concept will discuss how a contract should originally be allowed. This study uses qualitative methods through content analysis.",2024-10-17,
A Business History of Soy,"This is a business history of soy that reveals how Japanese imperial and military institutions and financial-mercantile-industrial interests created a role for soy as a versatile raw material and global commodity beginning in the 19th century, even before the Western world recognized this ""oilseed."" Originating in the rich food cultures of Asia, soy is praised as the ""magic bean."" About 360 million tons are produced in the world today, and it is traded globally to become food, feed, and fuel. It is the second largest source of vegetable oil in the world, and soy meal is an essential feed without which the modern livestock industries could not exist. Its dominance today is often accounted for in terms of its versatile nature. This book, however, argues that soy was transformed into a versatile industrial raw material and global commodity through the political-economic strategies of state and business actors engaged in the development of the capitalist world-economy. By studying little-known Japanese historical documents and corporate records, and focusing on the less-researched vegetable oil and industrial uses of soy, this book provides a better understanding of how this traditional Asian food was transformed into a global commodity embedded in contradictions. Promoted as a healthy and sustainable food source, soy is also a destructive cash crop whose cultivation and use have played a significant role in the current climate crisis. Based on this case of soy, the book provides a structural understanding of broader food and agriculture systems in the history of capitalism, making it of interest to students at an advanced level, academics, and researchers in the fields of business history, corporate governance, Japanese business, as well as the political economy of food and agriculture.",2024-10-16,
Do Exports of Services Lengthen the Duration of Export of Goods? Evidence from Kenya,"This study investigates the effect of service exports disaggregated into nine categories (transport, travel, construction, government, ICT, personal, cultural and recreational, financial, insurance, and other business services) on the survival of goods exports in Kenya. Estimates from the discrete-time probit model with random effects on bilateral trade data covering 1996 to 2019 show that export of services positively and significantly impact the duration of goods exports. A disaggregation of the goods into intermediate, consumption, capital, differentiated and homogenous products shows that transport and ICT service exports increase the duration of export of goods. Therefore, the simultaneous advancement of goods and service exports would foster the export survival of goods. In particular, the results indicate that export survival of value chain commodities would be enhanced through enhancing modes of transportation alongside communication and connectivity infrastructure. Our results also have implications for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which seeks to synchronously negotiate and promote trade in goods and trade in services within Africa.",2024-10-16,
Generalized Distribution Prediction for Asset Returns,"We present a novel approach for predicting the distribution of asset returns using a quantile-based method with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our model is designed in two stages: the first focuses on predicting the quantiles of normalized asset returns using asset-specific features, while the second stage incorporates market data to adjust these predictions for broader economic conditions. This results in a generalized model that can be applied across various asset classes, including commodities, cryptocurrencies, as well as synthetic datasets. The predicted quantiles are then converted into full probability distributions through kernel density estimation, allowing for more precise return distribution predictions and inferencing. The LSTM model significantly outperforms a linear quantile regression baseline by 98% and a dense neural network model by over 50%, showcasing its ability to capture complex patterns in financial return distributions across both synthetic and real-world data. By using exclusively asset-class-neutral features, our model achieves robust, generalizable results.",2024-10-15,
Decoding Market Efficiency: A Multifractal Approach to Financial Market Dynamics,"Financial markets were traditionally analyzed using the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which argued that asset prices fully reflected all available information. This led to the belief that price movements were random, making it impossible to consistently outperform the market. However, emerging research had highlighted that markets could exhibit multifractality, where inefficiencies existed across different time scales, challenging the traditional EMH framework. Our study built on these insights by investigating the market efficiency of several asset classes, including stock market indices, cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and Binance), commodities (gold and crude oil), fixed income (U.S. 10-Year &amp; 30-Year Treasury Bonds), and foreign exchange (EUR/USD &amp; GBP/USD). Utilizing the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) method, we analyzed the multifractal properties and efficiency of each asset class. The results revealed that traditional assets exhibited monofractality, adhering more closely to the EMH. In contrast, cryptocurrencies displayed significant inefficiencies, likely due to their volatility, market structure, and susceptibility to external shocks. The findings provided valuable insights into portfolio diversification and risk management, suggesting that inefficiencies in certain asset classes might present both opportunities and risks for investors.",2024-10-14,
Institutional investment in addictive industries: an important commercial determinant of health,"Background The production of addictive commodities is subject to a range of commercial determinants. There has nevertheless been a gap in understanding how investments into addictive commodities may function as commercial determinants. Institutional investors can yield important financial power with their investment decisions. Many investors apply responsible investment (RI) policies to address environmental, social, and governance concerns. Negative screening is used to exclude certain sectors or companies from investment portfolios, mainly for ethical concerns. Negative screening also affects investment into tobacco and other addictive industries. This article investigates RI policies toward addictive industries among institutional investors that are signatories of the Tobacco-Free Finance Pledge (TFFP; N = 161). The TFFP is an initiative created in 2021 to de-normalize tobacco-related investments. Methods The mixed-method study uses descriptive statistics to quantify the extent and scope of exclusion policies as well as institutional and geographical profiles of investors, and a qualitative analysis of the justifications for these exclusion policies. Results Some TFFP signatories apply negative screening to other addictive industries (gambling: 35%; alcohol: 24%; cannabis 12% of signatories). There are important differences in the applied exclusion thresholds, with only 47% of TFFP signatories applying a zero-tolerance policy to tobacco. Thresholds are higher for other addictive industries. Signatories also differ in terms of their geographical and investor profiles. Justifications pertaining to compliance with international standards and reputational risks were the most common. Conclusion Addictive industries, such as tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and recreational cannabis, are increasingly excluded by investors. However, different understandings of RI influence how sector exclusions are implemented. Divesting from tobacco and other addictive industries is a crucial step toward a public health approach that prioritizes population health over financial profits. Prominent institutional investors are influential opinion leaders who can change the behavior of other investors and de-normalize controversial industries and reduce or prevent harm.",2024-10-14,

Overall, Shells strategic plans and adjustments aim to ensure resilience and adaptability, promising investors sustainable development amidst evolving market dynamics.",2024-10-12,
New approaches to the implementation of supervisory powers in capital markets and organized commodity markets,"The article analyzes new mechanisms and measures of influence on supervisory entities in capital markets and organized commodity markets. A general positive assessment is given to the innovations related to the introduction of more flexible tools for adjusting the state of stock and organized commodity markets, as well as the expansion of the powers of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), while simultaneously strengthening the legal guarantees of the rights of supervised entities. Attention is paid to changes regarding the inclusion of individuals as subjects of responsibility under this law, clearer delineation of the scope of supervised entities, and significant expansion of the rights of supervised entities by utilizing the best practices of regulating procedural relations between the supervisory body and the supervised entity. The article also explores the deepening regulation of communicative connections between these entities and the procedures for implementing supervisory measures. Attention is given to preventive measures for violations, such as «recommendations by inspectors» and «requests for the adoption of measures.» The article analyzes new forms of implementing supervisory powers and measures of influence on supervised entities, as well as new mechanisms for their implementation that were not previously known in domestic practice. The legal significance of «public warnings» is highlighted, and a legal evaluation of «settlement agreements regarding the consequences of violating sectoral legislation» is provided as an alternative to administrative enforcement measures. According to the authors, concluding such an agreement cannot be considered as a discretionary power of the NSSMC but rather a right of the supervised entity. Conclusions are made regarding the compliance of the introduction of «controlled services» with the IOSCO principle. Taking into account the guarantees of the rights of supervised entities, as stipulated in Article 35 of the Law of Ukraine «On Amendments to the Law of Ukraine ‘On State Regulation of Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets’ and Some Other Legislative Acts of Ukraine on Improving State Regulation and Supervision in Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets» of February 22, 2024, No. 3585-IX (hereinafter referred to as Law No. 3585-IX). The article defines the functional purpose of legislative restrictions on financial sanctions against supervised entities - legal entities, which, in the authors’ view, aim to prevent their economic destruction and the disruption of economic ties in the respective market. In conclusion, the changes introduced as a result of the adoption of Law No. 3585-IX are expected to positively impact the relationship between the regulator and market participants. The innovations in the practice of legal regulation of relations between the regulator and supervised entities deserve to be extended to other similar areas of state control and supervision.",2024-10-12,
Financial Feasibility Of Aglaonema Commodity Ornamental Plant Business At Bibitbungaku Ornamental Plant Shop Tasikmalaya Regency,"Ornamental plants can be used as income for farmers and ornamental plants include businesses that are quite popular among the public. Aglaonema ornamental plants can be used as indoor decorations, this is due to the beauty possessed by this plant from the patterns and colors on its leaves. This study aims to analyze the financial feasibility of the Aglonema commodity ornamental plant business in Tasikmalaya Regency, especially at the Bibitbungaku Ornamental Plant Shop using the R/C Ratio. In this study only took 1 sample respondent, namely only the owner of Bibitbungaku Ornamental Plant Shop. Based on the results and discussion, it can be concluded in this study about the financial feasibility of the Aglaonema ornamental plant business, the R C Ratio value is 1.76 which indicates that the R/C Ratio value is more than one, so that from this analysis the Aglaonema ornamental plant business at the Bibitbungaku Ornamental Plant Shop is feasible to be developed further by considering increasing the knowledge and skills of farmers, as well as better environmental management.",2024-10-12,
MONGOLIA IN INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICS CHAINS,"The article is devoted to the methodological and practical aspects of assessing the specifics of developing countries, including Mongolia, in estimate of the performance of financial and logistics chains. The relevance and significance of the study is that decisions on the investment program (Vision 2050) are made on the basis of traditional assessments of investment projects, its’ economic and social effects. Based on a generalization of available information and data, the article presents the author’s approach to justifying the need to change traditional assessment methods. The necessity of taking into account in models the costs of diversification and forecasting changes in the place in value chains when implicit costs arise in the future has been proven. Ignoring the fact that the costs of international trade are passed on to consumers in small commodity economies often leads to recessions and the need for constant debt refinancing. The article examines the structure of Mongolia’s exports and imports not in traditional estimates, but from the position of influence on future growth of expenses in the absence of sources to cover them. Particular attention is paid to the growing inefficiency and irrationality of budget expenditures in the traditional forecasting of the effects and benefits from the implementation of the project. In relation to the research topic, the use of the terms «budget liquidity», «fictitious financial flows», «disguise of commodity flows» is justified. An approach to the classification of factors that distort the picture of the movement of financial and logistics flows from the point of view of influence on national economic interests is proposed. In conclusion, a conclusion is drawn about the possibility of practical application of the proposed approaches for the analysis of financial and logistics flows of other countries, as well as the existing assumptions in the application of this model.",2024-10-11,
ECONOMIC PORTRAIT OF KAZAKHSTAN: NEW MILESTONES,"Recent years have been marked by steady growth of the Kazakh economy, which is supported by the dynamic development of key sectors and the active introduction of new technologies. In 2024, the country continues to successfully adapt to the changing global economic environment, including commodity price volatility and global economic turmoil. The Kazakh economy has demonstrated steady positive dynamics, which is due to the stable growth of key industries and innovative development. Despite global economic challenges and fluctuations in commodity prices, the country continues to demonstrate adaptability and sustainability of economic growth in 2024. International financial institutions and analytical centers agree that the Kazakh economy will maintain moderate growth rates in 2024. This indicates a gradual recovery from global economic turmoil. An important factor contributing to such development is the diversification of the economy, aimed at reducing dependence on commodity exports and stimulating domestic consumption, infrastructure projects and innovation. The Kazakh government is actively working to improve the country's investment attractiveness, support small and medium-sized businesses and develop human capital. These measures are aimed at ensuring sustainable economic growth and improving the well-being of the population. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the current economic state of Kazakhstan, including the dynamics of GDP and GRP, as well as development prospects.",2024-10-10,
China’s financial spillovers to emerging markets,"This paper analyzes the financial spillovers of shocks originating in China to emerging markets. Using a high-frequency identification strategy based on sign and narrative restrictions, we find that equity markets react strongly and persistently to Chinese macroeconomic shocks, while monetary policy shocks have limited or no spillovers. The impact is particularly strong in Latin American equity markets, with the likely channel being the effect of shocks in China on international commodity prices. These effects extend to various financial variables, such as sovereign and corporate spreads and exchange rates, suggesting that macroeconomic shocks in China may have implications for economic cycles and financial stability in emerging markets.",2024-10-09,
Forecasting Agricultural Commodity Prices with ARIMA Models,"Agricultural product sales represent a critical convergence within the supply chain and act as the essential bridge between consumer and farmer. It also impacts overall product availability and economic stability. In countries like India, where a major number of people depend on agriculture directly or indirectly, accurate prediction of agricultural commodity prices becomes useful for ensuring financial stability and food security. The price of agricultural products is a critical measure of market focus framed by a complex interplay of factors like production costs, consumer demand, and government policies. However, a significant information asymmetry between producers and markets often leads to pre-eminent price fluctuations, posing challenges for farmers and consumers. The outcome of this paper is to show how historical price data helps forecast future prices, how these predictions help make better decisions, and how they affect the supply chain system. Also, several forecasting techniques exist, like time series analysis regression techniques and machine learning algorithms. This paper uses historical data to forecast global grain prices such as coffee, wheat, and corn for the next one years. The results were obtained using Python and a univariate ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) technique. These forecasts help farmers make better decisions and impact investment tactics, crop selection, and resource plans.",2024-10-08,
Paper banknotes of Catherine the Great in Russia: Historiographical aspect,"The aim of the study is to determine how the topic of Catherine the Great’s banknotes is covered in historical science. The paper examines the aspects to which researchers pay most attention: the reasons for the introduction of banknotes, the essence of the new system, its evolution and impact on the country’s economy. It is noted that a significant portion of the works list various historical facts related to the issue of banknotes, but there is no in-depth analysis. However, some works stand out: they consider the issue of banknotes in a more comprehensive way: within the framework of the development of Russia’s financial and monetary system. The scientific novelty lies in a comprehensive assessment of how Catherine the Great’s banknotes are evaluated in historical science. As a result of the study, the author concludes: despite some advantages from the introduction of banknotes (overcoming the state budget deficit, developing the commodity-monetary system), the disadvantages of this system (inflation with constant issue of banknotes) were not overcome either under Catherine the Great or in the first half of the 19th century.",2024-10-08,
Knowledge Management in Saudi Universities and Its Utilization for Financial Resource Development: A Survey and Applied Study at Najran University,"Purpose: The study aims to explore knowledge management in Saudi Universities and its use in enhancing financial resources from the perspectives of leaders and faculty members at Najran University. Methodology: A descriptive-analytical documentary approach and a field survey were used with a questionnaire administered to a stratified random sample of (78) leaders, faculty members, and assistants at Najran University. Findings/Conclusions: Results indicate that knowledge management at Najran University is highly practiced overall. However, the survey shows limited investment of knowledge in financial resource development. Significant gender-based differences were found, favoring females, while no differences were observed based on college, job position, or experience. There remains a significant gap between knowledge management and its use in increasing university resources. Practical Implications: A strategy is needed to leverage intellectual capital in resource development by promoting innovations, utilizing patents, and research centers, transforming knowledge into commercial products, and establishing effective global marketing partnerships. Originality/Value: This study fills a theoretical literature gap and offers practical solutions to convert theoretical knowledge into economic commodities that benefit society, aiding in diversifying funding sources for Saudi, Arab, and developing country universities.",2024-10-06,
Spillovers and Correlation Among Energy Futures Markets,"In recent years the economic risk has increased for all entities. One form of risk that has been consistently felt is exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices. The volatility of both financial and commodities markets is the subject of considerable attention. In particular, volatility in the energy commodities markets has become very important in recent years on tension on the commodity markets. In general, we refer to commodity price fluctuation recorded in 2009 and 2012-2013. Instead, analyzing energy commodities markets in more detail, we refer to price increases recorded in 2008, 2014 and 2022. For example, in 2014 and 2022 the Russia-Ukraine conflict had significantly consequences and repercussions on the price of natural gas and all commodity energy. Volatility is a factor of market instability as it measures risk. For this reason, attracts great attention for policy makers and financial market participants. From this premises we intend to estimate the appropriate model to analyze the volatility and correlation between the different energy commodities considered. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the presence and extent of volatility transmission in energy markets: Crude oil, Natural gas, Gasoline and Heating oil. Finally, we perform a rolling estimation and forecasting of a model. The results show a significantly volatility spillovers effects and large GARCH affects for all markets. The study provides evidence for a high level of integration in energy commodity derivatives markets.",2024-10-06,
"Musculoskeletal Health Problems Among the Loom Weavers of Sirajganj District, Bangladesh","Land use change is increasing in West Nusa Tenggara province, especially in Bima district. This condition occurs because people who make land use change patterns that are utilized as agricultural areas for corn commodities. The limited agricultural land in Bima Regency with the potential for good selling prices of corn commodities is a major factor in land use change, this has an impact on flood disaster vulnerability. This study aimed to determine the condition of the livelihood assets of seasonal corn farmers in the Bima district. The research method used a descriptive presentative statistical approach. The sample in this study amounted to 97 respondents who were taken in 8 districts with flood vulnerability, namely Sanggar, Madapangga, Palibelo, Woha, Belo, Monta, Sape, and Lambu. Random sampling was used to determine the respondents. The results showed that the condition of the livelihood assets of seasonal corn farmers in Bima District from 8 flood-prone villages is dominated by human resources, where the average percentage value is 83%. This is followed by physical assets at 81% and natural and financial resources at 71%, while the lowest is social assets with a percentage value of 69%. The farmer livelihood assets with high percentage values in each flood-prone area are human resources in Sanggar, natural resources in Palibelo, financial and physical in Sape, and social assets in Palibelo and Woha. The pentagon of livelihood assets does not form a triangle, so it can be concluded that there is inequality between assets. The lack of agricultural land owned by farmers encourages the use of land cover as corn farmland. This can be seen from the use of land by farmers that is not their own, resulting in environmental damage that causes flood vulnerability. Keywords: Land use change, Livelihood assets, Flood Disaster",2024-10-04,
Digital financial assets as technology of fixing property claims and exchanging data about them,"The authors explore the phenomenon of digital financial assets from the perspective of innovative investment technology. The dualism of legislative provisions interpreting the legal nature of these assets is criticized. The conclusion is substantiated that digital financial assets do not belong to objects of civil rights previously unknown to the Russian legal system, but represent property rights that are individualized in circulation by unique information codes. Being negotiable investment assets, they have a commodity-value nature; data on their ownership and transfer of rights to them are transmitted via Internet communications. Through digital financial assets, information technology has been implemented to record the property claims of participants in civil turnover and exchange data about them; they can submit mandatory requirements that are not legally prohibited from alienating them within the framework of assignable structures. Due to this innovative technology, participants in civil turnover receive the legal equivalent of a certain mandatory requirement in digital form, including a requirement fixed in equity securities, a requirement to transfer such securities, as well as corporate rights determined by participation in the capital of a non-public joint-stock company. The use of digital financial assets provides an opportunity for individuals and legal entities to build investment relationships with minimal intermediary participation, conduct financial transactions in a transparent manner, increase investment profitability, and simplify the search for counterparties.",2024-10-04,
Agricultural Marketing in Small and Micro Businesses: An Integrated Approach to Infrastructural Development,"Small and private subsidiary farms are important members of agricultural community. However, they still lack good infrastructure to market their products because they remain beyond the scope of state interest. The agricultural infrastructure in its present condition neither gives farmers access to co-financing nor allows them to shape the list of services they need. The research featured program documents issued by the Government of the Russian Federation that determine the development of wholesale food markets and aggregators of farm produce. The author generalized the experience of retail chains and agricultural consumer marketing cooperatives, as well as studied the cases of small rural businesses merging into marketing cooperatives in agricultural regions. The bibliographic study covered best foreign practices in shaping infrastructure for small farm produce, which were compared with Russian experience. The author also developed an abstract-logical method of establishing the interaction between stakeholders in a new system of farm produce aggregators. In this research, agricultural regions demonstrated the most acute problems in small business marketing. A good system of agricultural infrastructure supports production in all sectors of small business with growth potential. Today, small businesses are alone in organizing their own sales as wholesale distribution centers are not available to them. These centers work with small suppliers through intermediaries, i.e., aggregators. In the Kemerovo Region, an example of such aggregators is the one created on corporate principles between the Magnit retail chain and the Kalina-Malina agricultural consumer marketing cooperative. The experience demonstrated some advantages and disadvantages. The article introduces conditions for successful financial relations in commodity circulation chains in different distribution systems, including farmers, aggregators, and wholesale distribution centers. This approach reduces prices on consumer markets while increasing the efficiency of small farms.",2024-10-02,
Investigating the price determinants of the European Emission Trading System: a non-parametric approach,"Understanding the intricacies of factors influencing European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) market prices is paramount for effective policy making and strategy implementation. We propose the use of the Information Imbalance, a non-parametric measure recently introduced in the physics community for quantifying the degree to which a set of variables is informative with respect to another one, to study the relationships among macroeconomic, economic, uncertainty, and energy variables concerning EU ETS price between January 2014 and April 2023. Our analysis shows that in Phase 3, commodity-related variables such as the ERIX index are the most informative in explaining the behaviour of the EU ETS market price. Transitioning to Phase 4, financial fluctuations take centre stage, with the uncertainty in the EUR/CHF exchange rate emerging as a crucial determinant. These results reflect the disruptive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis in reshaping the importance of the different variables. In addition to highlighting the shift in influential factors between Phase 3 and Phase 4, our findings underscore how macroeconomic volatility and energy disruptions have altered market dynamics. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the volatility in financial markets and fluctuations in energy demand and supply significantly affected the predictive power of different variables. Moreover, the energy crisis amplified the sensitivity of EU ETS prices to energy-related factors, reinforcing the importance of incorporating multiple dimensions into market analysis. Beyond variable analysis, we also propose to leverage the Information Imbalance to address the problem of mixed-frequency forecasting, and we identify the weekly time scale as the most informative for predicting the EU ETS price. Finally, we show how the Information Imbalance can be effectively combined with Gaussian Process regression for efficient nowcasting and forecasting using very small sets of highly informative predictors.",2024-10-02,
Exploring the role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy into performance of graduate-owned small and medium-sized enterprises in Tanzania,"Purpose The study assessed the role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) in the performance of graduate-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Specifically, the paper focused on how graduate owners’ confidence in identifying and commercializing new business opportunities and create new commodities according to the market demand influences both, the financial and non-financial performance of graduate-owned SMEs. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a cross-sectional survey design, in which 228 SME graduate owners majored in entrepreneurship were involved through online structured questionnaires. The relationship between the variables was determined by using partial least squares structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results indicate that entrepreneurial self-efficacy of graduate SME owners influence the financial and non-financial performance of their SMEs. Specifically, financial performance values have a ß-value of 0.576 and a p -value of &lt;0.0001, non-financial performance values have a ß-value of 0.275 and a p -value of &lt;0.0001. Practical implications In order to improve the performance of graduate-owned SMEs, universities should strive to equip graduates with self-confidence, which will enable them to utilize their entrepreneurial competences acquired through the entrepreneurship course programs. This will enable them to tackle business environmental challenges and be able to run successful businesses. Originality/value The results of this study extend the use of the self-efficacy theory in explaining the performance of graduate-owned SMEs in Tanzanian.

Therefore, the study engaged graduate entrepreneurs who majored in entrepreneurship, which has not been the focus in most studies.",2024-10-01,
"""Green Hills And Golden Brews: The Tea Profile Of Kerala""","The plantation sector in Kerala, encompassing key crops like tea, coffee, and rubber, faces significant challenges that threaten its economic viability and the livelihoods of workers. High production costs, coupled with fluctuating market prices, have positioned Kerala as one of the highest-cost producers of plantation commodities in India. The cost of producing tea has escalated dramatically over the years, severely impacting profitability and leading to financial instability for many growers. Additionally, climate change has introduced further complications, resulting in unpredictable weather patterns, increased pest infestations, and damage to plantation infrastructure. These factors have not only diminished productivity but have also jeopardized the sustainability of the entire sector. To address these issues, a multifaceted approach is necessary. Implementing a support price mechanism can stabilize incomes for growers, while crop diversification can enhance revenue generation and reduce dependency on a single crop. Moreover, investing in skill development programs tailored to the needs of the plantation workforce is vital, enabling workers to adapt to value-added production processes. Strengthening worker welfare through the enforcement of the Plantation Labour Act and improving access to education and healthcare in remote plantation areas are also crucial. Collaborative efforts between government entities and plantation stakeholders can lead to enhanced infrastructure, better access to technology, and educational opportunities, ensuring a resilient and sustainable plantation sector that benefits both producers and local communities alike. By prioritizing these strategies, the plantation industry in Kerala can navigate its current challenges and pave the way for a more sustainable and prosperous future",2024-10-01,
Health in the age of asset manager capitalism,"A relatively small number of for-profit asset managers-financial intermediaries that invest capital on behalf of other investors-have emerged in recent decades to become some of the most influential commercial actors in the global political economy. Despite their important role in society, asset managers have received little attention from a public health perspective. In this article, we aimed to propose a conceptual framework of potential pathways and mechanisms through which asset managers may influence health and equity. The framework included asset class-specific pathways related to investments in publicly listed corporate equity, private equity, 'real assets' (e.g. housing, hospitals, farmland) and commodities. The framework also included more generalized pathways, focusing on ways in which the large and highly concentrated asset management sector can drive economic inequities, influence policy and political decision-making and shape the global 'development' agenda. We argue that measures challenging so-called 'asset manager capitalism', such as promoting and protecting the public ownership of companies and assets in essential sectors, are imperative to address the commercial determinants of ill health and inequity.",2024-10-01,
Creating Positive Customers Evaluation: The Impact of Efficient CRM Processes on Increasing Client Satisfaction,"Commodity creation took precedence over endurance as the industrial revolution of the first half of the twentieth century led to the digitization of industrial techniques. Subsequently, the focus shifted to promotional elements that gave priority to consumer satisfaction. The technological advancements of the 20th century and globalization have brought humans to the highest levels of the asset organization, which has had a profound impact on employment. Ancient Hindu texts such as demonstrate the importance of human resources and demonstrate that structured management of human personnel dates back thousands of years. However, the first signs of the evolution of Hrd (human capital administration) approaches date back to the 1780 factory insurrection. During this time, technological breakthroughs necessitated improved work practices, productivity, and quality. The financial advantages of splitting of labor were discussed by Smith (1776) in his work “An Enquiry into the Causes and Nature of Wealth of Nations.” He suggested that specialization could increase the efficiency of labor. He perceived three benefits from a separation of labor: skill growth, time savings, and the ability to use specialized instruments. The creative endeavor of Owen (1825) demonstrates the significance of individuals in the operation of businesses. He maintained that one of the most effective expenditures managements can make is money invested in personnel development. Babbage (1832) investigated and developed the concept of specialization of labor in an even more thorough matching of individual expertise and abilities with particular tasks, based on his work, he came to that conclusion. As the work of Taylor (1911) tried to codify worker situations, procedures, methods, and tacit talents into concrete norms and formulae, a revolutionary shift occurred in the realm of interpersonal management practices. Research on the connection among productivity and the workplace was first undertaken by Mayo and his colleagues in 1927–1932. Barnard (1938) and other researchers followed up on these groundbreaking studies, which completely changed the realm of hiring and firing methods. The controversy about if effective human resources management is just jargon or a real concept is still up for debate, despite the fact that there has been a sizable body of literature on the subject. By analyzing the level of strategic HRM implementation and its effects on organizational performance in Nigeria’s manufacturing sector, this report aimed to expand the scope of previous research. The stated goal of the multi-respondent survey, which included 21 manufacturing organizations in the nation of Nigeria, had been to find a fit among corporate success and strategic staffing practices. The data obtained was evaluated using descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and correlational analysis. Results indicate that production enterprises in Nigeria employed moderate amounts of tactical HRM. Findings also show this path The main tactical human resources procedures that affect the effectiveness of organizations in Nigeria’s manufacturing sector are management devolution, creative hiring and hiring methods, ongoing workers education and training, based on shares compensation, performance appraisal, professional development, and active employee involvement in decisions and actions. It follows that businesses involved in production should focus more on these procedures in order to enhance their use throughout the sector.",2024-10-01,
Calibrating Ukraine’s Growth Model: How Can Ukraine Emulate Poland’s Growth?,"This study provides a comparative analysis of the economic growth paths of Ukraine and Poland from a growth‑model perspective and determines how to calibrate Ukraine’s growth model to converge with Poland’s booming economy. The methodology comprises an approach to operationalizing growth models for GDP growth decomposition into “import‑adjusted” demand components, drawing on national input‑output data from 2000 to 2019. I found that from 2000 to 2003, both European economies relied on a combination of exports and domestic consumption. Expanded trade integration and an FDI boost after Poland joined the EU in 2004 spurred the Polish growth model’s shift to a distinctively export‑led, FDI‑driven strategy with accelerated GDP growth rates. In Ukraine, in the wake of the great financial crisis, I identified a transition to a consumption‑led growth model that, along with a declining investment component of aggregate demand, led to fading growth rates. An analysis of sectoral contributions to GDP growth revealed that avoiding deindustrialization in Poland underpinned the country’s export‑led strategy, unlike Ukraine, which underwent a key sectoral shift from manufacturing to a commodities‑based orientation after 2008. Both these economies demonstrated a high level of integration into global value chains, focusing on labor‑intensive manufacturing and services, but Poland has outperformed Ukraine in terms of share of high value‑added exports, which increased after EU accession. Following the Polish pattern, I propose that Ukraine’s growth model should activate the FDI driver of economic growth, upgrading the export structure and moving up value chains to unlock the country’s growth opportunities. The study represents the first comparison of Ukraine’s and Poland’s economic growth paths that traces the changes in dominant final demand components and macro‑sectors in the two countries’ economic growth profiles. This paper contributes to the comparative political economy literature on the growth models of peripheral economies, providing insights that can inform policies for growth model transformation.",2024-09-30,
Crypto laundering prevention in Indonesia: The role of regulatory technology and financial intelligence unit,"Research aims: In Indonesia, crypto laundering has become an emerging threat through digital payments since 2015. This study aims to elaborate the crypto laundering prevention through the utilization of regulatory technology (RegTech) and the role of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Design/Methodology/Approach: The study was conducted using a qualitative content analysis approach with the support of NVivo 12. Data was sourced from secondary data in the form of law documents that have been established and published by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (CFTR). Research findings: Crypto laundering prevention is implemented through Know Your Customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring based on a risk-based approach. Normatively, KYC and transaction monitoring should be implemented on RegTech-based face recognition for KYC and blockchain analytic tools for transaction monitoring. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the FIU in Indonesia is the Indonesian Transaction Report and Analysis Center (INTRAC) which has the authority to receive and conduct further analysis of transaction monitoring results. INTRAC conducts advanced analysis with a ‘follow the money’ approach. The existence of INTRAC’s role depends on the tools, technology, and human resources that represent it.Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study contributes to knowledge in the field of forensic accounting. The findings and discussions in this study provide valuable insights into the current contemporary accounting issues and their relationship with other disciplines.Practitioner/Implication: This study provides insights for regulators to collaborate with various experts from information technology and environmental fields regarding developing regulations and policies to prevent crypto laundering. Research limitation: The data used was only sourced from secondary data (regulatory documents), so the role of RegTech and FIU was only studied normatively.",2024-09-30,
Stablecoins in the System of Current Russian Legislation,"The relevance of this research lies in the need to comprehend the legal implications of the development of stablecoins as new financial instruments. Faced with the processes of digitalization, legal systems have been required to develop a response to the significant changes to the techniques of undertaking domestic and crossborder transactions and settlements. In particular this concerns the emergence of the possibility of direct transactions between counterparties, bypassing the classical financial institutions. The emergence of new, digital objects with an unspecified legal regime (cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, etc.) has also led to problems. Stablecoins are one of the most frequently used objects. They are a type of digital asset accepted in transactions at a predetermined (determined) value (rate). The aim of the research is to establish potential strategies for incorporating stablecoins in Russian civil law as objects of legal rights. For this purpose, the article discusses the approaches of foreign regulators when selecting a model for regulating relations with such assets. It notes that they are characterised by a pragmatism which allows the rules developed for known objects (securities, exchange commodities, etc.) to be extended to different types of stablecoins for a variety of purposes. In the Russian Federation, the formation of a legal environment for the circulation of digital assets, including those which possess the features of stablecoins, is still at an early stage. The main legislative acts, including the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, only address the issue of instruments created and traded on domestic, Russian platforms. An analysis of the Law on Digital Financial Assets and the Law on Attraction of Investments shows that many of the digital rights defined therein are similar in nature to stablecoins. They can be either secured (utilitarian rights, a number of DFAs), or unsecured (digital currency with a fixed value). However, Russian legislation, including the Law on Currency Regulation, does not refer to and, therefore, does not regulate relations with the use of “external” stablecoins. The need to introduce “external” stablecoins into the Russian legal framework, including for use in foreign trade transactions, requires changes to the legislation and regulatory approach. The article analyzes recent legislative changes and legislative initiatives in the field of digital rights regulation, and suggests ways of removing existing gaps and inconsistencies.",2024-09-30,
Analisis Lingkungan Internal dan Eksternal Sub Terminal Agribisnis Komoditi Mentimun di Kelurahan Koto Baru Payo Basuang Kecamatan Payakumbuh Timur,"The mechanism for the agribusiness sub terminal is to collect agricultural production from the agribusiness sub terminal and partner farmers and then from traders who make pre-orders by telephone through the agribusiness sub terminal administrator.

"ANALYSIS OF TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE CRAB TRAP FISHERY BUSINESS IN SALEMO ISLAND, NORTH LIUKANG TUPABIRING DISTRICT, PANGKEP REGENCY","Crab (Portunus pelagicus) is one of the economically important marine products produced from Indonesian coastal waters. Market demand for crab commodities continues to increase. Crab traps are a fishing tool that is very popular with fishermen for catching crab because this fishing tool is passive, cheap and easy to operate and selective for fish (environmentally friendly). Based on the above, bearing in mind the importance of efforts to improve the standard of living and welfare of fishermen, it is necessary to have a fishing business to make it more profitable and responsible. The aim of this research is to analyze the technical and financial aspects of the crab trap fishing business on Salemo Island in February and April 2018. This research uses a survey research method, with data collected using a questionnaire using a random sampling method for fishermen who operate crab traps. Based on the research results, technical aspects include the fishing ground for crab traps, which has muddy bottom topography. The fishing season in a year is the peak season in May–September, the normal season in March–April and the lean season in October–February. The production of catches by crab trap fishermen on Salemo Island, Pangkep Regency, ranges between 1.01 and 1.95 kg/trip/unit of fishing gear and 264 and 591 kg/year/unit of fishing gear. The average value of the R/C ratio for crab trap businesses is 1.26, so the crab trap business is feasible to develop.",2024-09-29,
WAREHOUSE RECEIPT SYSTEM USING TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (TAM) FOR AGRICULTURAL ISLAMIC FINANCING,"Objectives: This paper offers an analysis of Islamic banks that are expected to be able to fully contribute to the availability of agricultural sector financing with ease of requirements and guarantees for farmers who need additional working capital for their farming businesses through user-friendly applications. Islamic banks also need other supporting institutions, such as guarantee institutions that are authorized to issue collateral in the form of Warehouse Receipts (WRS), start-up companies for marketing agricultural products, internet technology for information on the feasibility of farmers' businesses, and others. Theoretical Framework: TAM adopts a causal chain of beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviours as proposed by social psychologists named (Fisbein and Ajzeem,1975). Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) is a trade and financial instrument that allows commodities stored in a warehouse to obtain financing from financial institutions without requiring other collateral. Method: The TAM method is used to measure farmers' perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of Internet-based WRS guarantee for agricultural financing with a sample of 193 respondents consisting of farmers and Islamic bank employees in the financing section. Financing/Banking Institutions and Warehouse Managers are no longer unfamiliar with the term Warehouse Receipt. This document of proof of ownership of goods is issued by the Warehouse Manager who is tasked with managing goods that are used as collateral for the granting of credit/financing by financial institutions to the owner of the goods. Results and Discussion: The results of the analysis show that the direct effect of perceived usefulness has a significantly greater correction with behavior of use, and ease of use on usage attitude has a positive relationship, strong and significant, as well as behavioural intentions of use and actual system usage. But the indirect effect of usefulness and ease of use on behavioural intention of use is positive, weak and insignificant. The direct effect of ease of use on the actual system usage has a positive, strong and significant. The indirect effect of usefulness and ease of use on the actual system usage through usage attitudes is positive, strong and significant, but through behavioural intentions of use, the effect is positive, weak and insignificant. Research Implications: It means that farmers have expectations in this Internet-based WRS guarantee for agricultural Islamic financing product. However, Islamic banks indicate an uncertain perception. Originality/Value: This paper is one of the studies that still rarely discuss agricultural financing in Islamic banking using warehouse receipts as collateral. This analysis is an initial study of farmers' perceptions of Islamic bank agricultural financing with this warehouse receipt guarantee. The conclusions and implications discussed in this paper exceed the expectations and desires of farmers, as well as financing products in Islamic banks.",2024-09-27,

Non-Commodity Agricultural Price Hedging with Minimum Tracking Error Portfolios: The Case of Mexican Hass Avocado,"The present paper tests the use of an agricultural futures minimum tracking error portfolio to replicate the price of the Mexican Hass avocado (a non-commodity). The motivation is that this portfolio could be used to balance the basis risk that the avocado price hedge issuer could face. By performing a backtest of a theoretical avocado producer from January 2000 to September 2023, the results show that the avocado producer could hedge the avocado price by 94%, with the hedge offered by a theoretical financial or government institution. Also, this issuer could balance the risk of such a hedge by buying a coffee–sugar futures portfolio. The cointegrated or long-term relationship shows that using such a futures portfolio is useful for Mexican Hass avocado price hedging. This paper stands as one of the first in testing futures portfolios to offer a synthetic hedge of non-commodities through a commodities’ futures portfolio.",2024-09-27,
Artificial Intelligence and the Black Hole of Capitalism: A More-than-Human Political Ethology,"This paper applies a ‘more-than-human’ theoretical framework to assess artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of a capitalist economy. Case studies of AI applications from the fields of finance, medicine, commerce and manufacturing elucidate how this capitalist context shapes the aims and objectives of these innovations. The early sections of the paper set out a more-than-human theoretical perspective on capitalism, to show how the accumulation of capital depends upon free flows of commodities, money and labour, and more-than-human forces associated with supply and demand. The paper concludes that while there will be many future applications of AI, it is already in thrall to capitalist enterprise. The primary social significance of AI is that it enhances capital accumulation and a capitalist ‘black hole’ that draws more and more human activity into its sphere of influence. AI has consequent negative social, political and environmental capacities, including financial uncertainty, waste, and social inequalities. Some ways to contain and even subvert these negative consequences of an AI-fuelled capitalism are suggested.",2024-09-27,

Market disruptions in electric vehicles and the problems they cause for ports and supply chains,"Cars are a specific commodity: on the one hand, they represent an independent product that is delivered in individual units, but on the other hand, their dimensions do not allow them to be stored in conventional warehouses of any style. The precipitous decline in sales of electric vehicles has far-reaching consequences that are not apparent at first glance. In Europe, more new cars are currently imported than sold, and this leads to major financial and logistical problems. Just one car takes up to ten square meters of space when not in use. This creates huge problems at car port terminals. In Germany, these are two terminals – those in Emden and Bremerhaven. The one in Bremerhaven is one of the largest car ports in the world.

"Using machine learning to forecast clean energy, commodities, green bonds and ESG index prices: How important is financial stress?","Purpose This study investigates clean energy, commodities, green bonds and environmental, social and governance (ESG) index prices forecasting and assesses the predictive performance of various factors on these asset prices, used for the development of a robust forecasting support decision model using machine learning (ML) techniques. More specifically, we explore the impact of the financial stress on forecasting price. Design/methodology/approach We utilize feature selection techniques to evaluate the predictive efficacy of various factors on asset prices. Moreover, we have developed a forecasting model for these asset prices by assessing the accuracy of two ML models: specifically, the deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model. To check the robustness of the study results, the authors referred to bootstrap linear regression as an alternative traditional method for forecasting green asset prices. Findings The results highlight the significance of financial stress in enhancing price forecast accuracy, with the financial stress index (FSI) and panic index (PI) emerging as primary determinants. In terms of the forecasting model's accuracy, our analysis reveals that the LSTM outperformed the XGBoost model, establishing itself as the most efficient algorithm among the two tested. Practical implications This research enhances comprehension, which is valuable for both investors and policymakers seeking improved price forecasting through the utilization of a predictive model. Originality/value To the authors' best knowledge, this marks the inaugural attempt to construct a multivariate forecasting model. Indeed, the development of a robust forecasting model utilizing ML techniques provides practical value as a decision support tool for shaping investment strategies.",2024-09-25,
REFORMULANDO O JOGO TRIBUTÁRIO: DESAFIOS E SOLUÇÕES NAS TRANSAÇÕES DE GAMES ON-LINE,"In recent years, computer games have gained widespread popularity, driven by technological advancements and internet expansion, leading to the prevalence of on-line gaming and the decline of physical media. The taxation of these games has become a debated issue, particularly regarding the differentiation between off-the-shelf and custom software. In 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court deemed software taxable as services. Uncertainties have arisen regarding in-game transactions, encompassing the acquisition of goods, rights, or financial operations. This article aims to understand whether transactions in on-line games qualify as the acquisition of goods or services, determining the applicable taxes, considering the Brazilian legal landscape post-Tax Reform. Specific objectives include grasping technical distinctions between goods, commodities, and services; conceptualizing and distinguishing software and on-line games from a technological perspective; outlining types of transactions in on-line games to support their legal classification; understanding the Supreme Court's rationale on software as services; and analyzing the impact of the Tax Reform on the taxation of in-game transactions. The research, characterized as pure and explanatory, employs a qualitative approach, deductive method, and bibliographic/documentary procedures. It concludes that the accurate taxation of on-line gaming transactions is a significant source of legal uncertainty, stemming from the classification and legality of tax incidence. The Tax Reform, by instituting a single tax for operations involving goods, services, and rights, holds the potential to resolve these uncertainties, rendering unnecessary the determination of the nature of operations for tax purposes.",2024-09-25,
"Improving the Cardamom Marketing: Assessing the Marketing Efficiency of Cardamom in Theni District, Tamil Nadu","Introduction: The cardamom is the oldest spices and belongs to Zingiberaceae family. It is cultivated in the thick shady, rainy forests of the Western Ghats of the South India. The major growing states are Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in reference to green cardamom (Small) and its botanical name Elettaria cardamomum. The part of Theni district is constituted by thick vegetations of hills of Western Ghats and Cumbum Valley at Bodi and Uthamapalayam taluk. In these areas, the farmers are cultivating the Cardamom. This study aims to find out the socio-economic characters, marketing behavior, assess the marketing efficiency of different supply channels and ranking the major problems faced by farmers to market their agricultural product. Methodology: The author used both primary and secondary data. The maximum area covered by cardamom was used as criteria for selecting the blocks. Purposive random sampling method was used to select the villages and the data was collected from the 60 farmers and other stakeholders using well-structured questionnaire. The descriptive statistics and percentage analysis were used for interpreting the results. For marketing analysis, marketing costs, marketing margin and price spread were estimated. For marketing efficiency, Acharya’s method (2003) was used. Results: The 34 respondents with 56.67 percent were found to be 21-35 years of age group. It was found that 7 respondents only with 11.67 percent and 26 respondents with 43.33 percent were found to be illiterate and the annual turnover of 1-5 lakh respectively. Using Acharya’s method (2003), the marketing efficiency of the channel I, II, III were 5.92, 9.97, 7.27 respectively. The price spread in the marketing channel I, II, and III are Rs. 295.94 per Kg, Rs. 163.54 per Kg and 229.48 per Kg respectively. It was shown that channel II is efficient due to high efficiency value and less price spread. Producer in the marketing channel II had highest share (90.88) in consumer rupee. The result showed that the Lack of timely adequate funds were major problem faced by the cardamom farmers with garret mean score of 65.23. The financial problems were common in the respondents. Conclusion: Marketing channel II was efficient because the spice auction center plays a vital role in protecting the farmer as well as consumer from the malpractices and exploitation of Intermediaries and to provide the transparency in trading operations of cardamom. The government may increase the financial assistance or technical support program to support the cardamom growers of the Tamil Nadu. The board should educate the farmers to grade or sort the cardamom before entering the e-Auction center to get better price for better quality of the commodity and to expand the pilot project of separate e-auctions for lab tested cardamom for artificial colours and pesticidal residues to potential markets of Tamil Nadu.",2024-09-25,

Multi-Task Forecasting of the Realized Volatilities of Agricultural Commodity Prices,"Motivated by the comovement of realized volatilities (RVs) of agricultural commodity prices, we study whether multi-task forecasting algorithms improve the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts of 15 agricultural commodities during the sample period from July 2015 to April 2023. We consider alternative multi-task stacking algorithms and variants of the multivariate Lasso estimator. We find evidence of in-sample predictability but scarce evidence that multi-task forecasting improves out-of-sample forecasts relative to a classic univariate heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR)-RV model. This lack of systematic evidence of out-of-sample forecasting gains is corroborated by extensive robustness checks, including an in-depth study of the quantiles of the distributions of the RVs and subsample periods that account for increases in the total spillovers among the RVs. We also study an extended model that features the RVs of energy commodities and precious metals, but our conclusions remain unaffected. Besides offering important lessons for future research, our results are interesting for financial market participants, who rely on accurate forecasts of RVs when solving portfolio optimization and derivatives pricing problems, and policymakers, who need accurate forecasts of RVs when designing policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of a rise in the RVs of agricultural commodity prices and the concomitant economic and political uncertainty.",2024-09-23,
The natural law and positivist approaches to legal understanding in the context of revealing the category of legal personality of professional participants in capital markets,"This article aims to analyze the main philosophical concepts used in understanding the legal category of legal personality and to conduct a descriptive study of the concepts related to this category that prevail in domestic science. The author of the article substantiates the position that the approaches to the theoretical and legal developments of the category of universal legal personality of legal entities should be based on the natural law type of legal understanding. At the same time, the article analyzes domestic authors’ approaches to understanding the legal category of legal personality and compares these approaches with those prevailing in Western countries. Furthermore, the author attempts to justify the expediency of distinguishing exclusive legal personality, given the positivist approach that underlies the construction of the model of the exclusive type of legal personality of professional participants in capital markets. In our opinion, establishing the exclusive legal personality of legal entities is a state-imposed limitation on their universal legal capacity, such as the ability to participate in certain civil-law relations, considering the social importance of the type of activity carried out by these entities. After all, the proper functioning of capital markets is crucial to the financial stability of the country. Capital markets, along with commodity markets, directly influence the formation of exchange rates by attracting foreign investment into the country’s economy. They can also act as a catalyst for economic growth by accumulating financial resources from the population to create capital-intensive productions with high value-added end products. However, achieving such results depends on the balanced state policy in the field of regulating the activities of professional participants in capital markets. To limit the speculative nature of such entities and ensure sustainable economic development, the scope of their legal capacity is narrowed by directly specifying in the law the types of activities they are permitted to engage in.",2024-09-21,
FORMATION OF A NEW PARADIGM OF GLOBAL POLITICAL AND MIGRATION PROCESSES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS IN UKRAINE,"The events of February 2022, related to the military aggression of the Russian Federation and a full-scale attack on Ukraine, became the greatest catastrophe of the twenty-first century and the most brutal war on European soil since the Second World War, and is gradually being defined as World War III in terms of its impact on global political and economic relations and the use of military weapons. Although no final assessment has been made (the war is ongoing), the undeniable consequence of Russian aggression has been the violation of the world order built after World War II and the risk of global chaos. One of the most powerful consequences of the war was an unprecedented wave of Ukrainian migration, the lion's share of which was to Europe. And while European countries, faced with an unprecedented influx of refugees, are withstanding the socio-economic burden with dignity, Ukraine has found itself in a demographic catastrophe. The wave of forced migration coincided with long-term demographic problems: a decline in the birth rate, an increase in the number of middle-aged people, and the outflow of population during the war. All these processes will have a steady impact on global migration and political processes. New instruments of state and global regulation of these processes will be required. They will also require the formation of a new paradigm of global economic development. The authors aim to deepen the study of the issue of identifying and assessing the preconditions and consequences of migration processes in the world under the influence of military operations in Ukraine. The paper examines the impact of migration processes on globalisation and economic processes in Europe and the world; the dynamics of the share of labour migrants in the total labour force by income level of destination countries in 2013, 2017, 2020; features of the migration wave of Ukrainians evacuated due to the military aggression of the Russian Federation in 2022; generalised statistical information on the migration processes of Ukrainians during the period of 01.02.2023 – 21.06.2023; detailed statistical data on the number of Ukrainian citizens abroad (as of 01.02.2023), broken down by migrant countries; political and socio-cultural context of the formation of a new paradigm of migration processes. The full implications for Ukrainian migration will be summarised after the war is over, but the following interim conclusions are relevant today. The analysis of migration processes in the world and Europe in the current context suggests that migration is actively taking place and contributes to the development of international integration, as it reduces the number of barriers and increases opportunities. The war in Ukraine will have a significant impact on the economy in terms of the following effects: disruption of global supply chains, increased inflationary pressures, higher energy and raw material prices; food prices will also increase as supplies of wheat and cereals from the Russian Federation and Ukraine are disrupted. and Ukraine have been disrupted; higher energy and commodity prices will cause further inflation, deteriorating economic prospects, reduced confidence and increased financial market risk associated with greater geopolitical tensions; worsening food security in some developing countries in the Middle East and Africa. On the other hand, migration is currently seen as a tool for long-term growth in the EU. The analysis shows that migration provides significant economic benefits, primarily to host countries. Today, the EU is facing a growing shortage of skilled labour due to unfavourable demographic trends in Europe. Given the massive emigration of Ukrainian citizens to the EU, migrants are solving the problem of staff shortages. This is especially true given that Ukrainian emigration provides for adequate social protection and legal support, which guarantees the right to settlement, work and education. The right to employment is readily exercised by Ukrainian migrants, as they are largely people of working age, primarily women. In general, it can be argued that the prospects for regional migration are currently linked to many factors and very uncertain prospects for a return to the pre-2022 or pre-pandemic models of the Eastern Partnership. The war in Ukraine is already escalating into a protracted conflict that will threaten both the economic situation of millions of people and the hopes of temporarily displaced Ukrainians to return home for a long time. As a result, displaced Ukrainians, their host EU countries, and the Ukrainian government will have to deal with the new circumstances, adapting temporary modalities to longer-term solutions.",2024-09-20,
The risk transmission from the COVID-19 to MENA stock markets: what is the best safe haven asset during the pandemic?,"Purpose This paper investigates potential safe haven assets for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) stock markets during the uncertainty period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach This study applies the dynamic conditional correlation–generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic (DCC-GARCH) model and the Diebold–Yilmaz spillover index for ten MENA stock markets, three precious metals and Bitcoin for the period 2013–2021. Findings Empirical results show, on the one hand, that the COVID-19 crisis risk has been transmitted to MENA stock markets through volatility spillover across markets. This has increased the conditional volatility for all markets. On the other hand, findings point out that the dynamic correlation between the precious metals/Bitcoin and stock markets is not stable and switches between low positive and negative values during the period under studies. Extending analysis to portfolio management, results reveal that investors should include precious metals/Bitcoin in their portfolio of stocks in order to reduce the risk of the portfolio. Finally, for the period of COVID-19, the analysis concludes that gold preserves its traditional role as a safe haven for MENA stock markets during the pandemic, while Bitcoin fails to provide this property. Practical implications These results have several implications for international investors, risk managers and financial analysts in terms of portfolio diversifications and hedging strategies. Indeed, the exploration of the volatility connectedness between financial, commodity and cryptocurrency markets becomes an essential task for all market participants during the COVID-19 outbreak. Such analysis can help investors and portfolio managers to evaluate the risk of investments in the MENA stock markets during the crisis period and to achieve the optimal diversification strategy and hedging instruments. Originality/value The paper interests MENA stock markets that experienced the last decade a substantial development in terms of market capitalization and number of listed firms. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the dynamic correlation between MENA stock markets and four potential safe haven assets, including three precious metals and Bitcoin. In addition, the paper employs two types of models, namely the DCC-GARCH model and the Diebold-Yilmaz spillover index.",2024-09-20,
Performance of Commodity Futures-Based Dynamic Portfolios,"This paper analyzes the return performance of various commodity futures-based dynamic portfolios over the period from 31 January 1986 to 31 July 2023. By constructing 30 distinct portfolios categorized by style and performance, we assess their potential for enhancing the performance of traditional portfolios consisting of equity and bonds. We find that most commodity portfolios do not offer statistically significant returns, either in terms of average or risk-adjusted returns. Only the portfolios in the basis category and portfolios in the term structure category exhibit significantly positive risk-adjusted returns, indicating their potential value for portfolio enhancement. The performance of these portfolios is not different in pre-financialization and financialization periods.",2024-09-19,
"Trading with propagators and constraints: applications to optimal
  execution and battery storage","Motivated by optimal execution with stochastic signals, market impact and constraints in financial markets, and optimal storage management in commodity markets, we formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with a general propagator model under linear functional inequality constraints. The optimal control is given explicitly in terms of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers and their conditional expectations, as a solution to a linear stochastic Fredholm equation. We propose a stochastic version of the Uzawa algorithm on the dual problem to construct the stochastic Lagrange multipliers numerically via a stochastic projected gradient ascent, combined with a least-squares Monte Carlo regression step to approximate their conditional expectations. We illustrate our findings on two different practical applications with stochastic signals: (i) an optimal execution problem with an exponential or a power law decaying transient impact, with either a `no-shorting' constraint in the presence of a `sell' signal, a `no-buying' constraint in the presence of a `buy' signal or a stochastic `stop-trading' constraint whenever the exogenous price drops below a specified reference level; (ii) a battery storage problem with instantaneous operating costs, seasonal signals and fixed constraints on both the charging power and the load capacity of the battery.",2024-09-18,

"Complexity and synthesis in the ""wholesale energy product"" legal notion","The concept of wholesale energy products (WEP) bears both complexity and synthetic nature of a new phenomenon. The complexity partly stems from the historically inherited specialization of technologies, which can now be combined into hybrid energy plants or energy hubs. WEP complexity causes a few specialized approaches and carve-outs with respect of every constituent commodity and service, however, it can be mitigated by policies promoting the universality of energy plants for rapid response to the changes in supply and demand. Physics of different substances that constitute WEP, such as natural gas, LNG, hydrogen, electricity, and their production, transportation, and storage infrastructure will remain a factor of distinction for the contractual and regulatory approach anytime soon. However, the impact of these differences has been and will be decreasing with hybridization of energy plants and popularization of the energy hubs that operate on different wholesale markets and, potentially, retail markets, too. Introduction of WEP effectively assumed that an energy hub becomes a new normal of energy flexibility on the market, of course, subject to further technology development, a high efficiency in converting power electrons to other forms of energy (methane and hydrogen molecules, for example) and vice versa. When (and if) such new normality happens, a further potential for uniform market rules is being realized - as was demonstrated in 2024 by expansion of the wholesale energy product definition in REMIT II. While LNG and hydrogen as well as their infrastructure are relatively new additions with some specifics to be ironed out, WEP can also be expected to expand further. The concept of a wholesale energy product had since 2011 led to the merger of both physical and financial instruments, so that many of them, especially physical products are subject to a double supervision; new contract forms and new data exchange standards had to be developed to optimize investments.",2024-09-11,

Bayesian Symbolic Regression and Other Similar Methods as a Tool for Forecasting Commodities Prices,"Bayesian Symbolic Regression (BSR) is used to predict spot prices of 56 commodities. BSR is a certain improvement over the symbolic regression technique based on genetic programming. Besides, there has been limited applications of the symbolic regression to forecasting prices in economics and finance. Contrary to prior simulations of BSR with synthetic data, this study discusses an application to the real-world data derived from commodities markets. In particular, forecasting one month ahead spot prices of 56 commodities. Indeed, BSR presents valuable capabilities for addressing the complexities associated with variable selection in econometric modelling. It is expected to also handle also some other challenges smoothly. Therefore, this study is carefully tailored to deal with commodity markets time-series data. Moreover, several alternative techniques are also tested, i.e., the symbolic regression with genetic programming, Dynamic Model Averaging, LASSO and RIDGE regressions, time-varying parameters regression, ARIMA, and no-change method, etc. In particular, the main aim is to focus on forecast accuracy. The obtained outcomes can give valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners interested in implementing BSR in econometric and financial projects in the future.",2024-09-09,
Money as a “Social Power”: Commodity Fetishism and Financialization,"Marx’s concepts of commodity and money fetishism explain the perception that money and commodities have “value,” presumably as part of their intrinsic properties. In fact, the exchange value of commodities and money results from living labor and the extraction of surplus value. With a historic review of the institutions for production, circulation, and credit, this appearance of capitalism can be explained. Further, the view that money is valuable in itself can lead to overexpansion of credit, stagnation, and instability. The attribution of “value” to living labor and the environment instead of money would result in different policies and priorities, and a more stable and equitable economy, rather than “financialization” and crises.

Sustainability Practices in Micro and Small Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) within the Commodity Market in Malaysia,"Sustainability has emerged as a critical consideration in the business strategic approach adopted to create lasting business operations. Previous studies suggest that for micro and small medium enterprises (MSMEs), factors such as top management support, government initiatives, financial resources, entrepreneurial orientation, resilience, and innovative transformation are crucial for sustainability and that sustainable practices correlate with improved competitive capabilities, company performance, creating more jobs opportunities, poverty reduction and market success in various countries (Khurana et al. 2021, Syamsari et al. 2022, M. Rudresh et al. 2022). In Malaysia, the contribution of MSMEs' GDP rose to 38.9% from 38.3% (Department of Statistics, 2021). Although the data recorded annual growth, the percentage of MSMEs that fail every year is a common global issue and needs to be analyzed. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the situation is far worse for the companies., where 68.9 percent experienced a decline for almost 50% of sales when MCO started (Annuar, 2020). Moreover, MSMEs are low in business strategies for sustainability. In conclusion, number of previous literatures suggest that MSMEs' adoption in business strategies is critical for achieving sustainability and enhancing performance in various sectors including the commodities market, particularly the agricultural sector.

Value‐added based inequity in global virtual water trade,"Abstract Commodity exports have played a crucial role in driving global economic growth, but they have also led to increased flow and consumption of natural resources worldwide. To measure and analyse the inter‐regional virtual water consumption and value‐added benefits driven by exports, as well as the unequal exchange between regions, we utilised the global supply chain database of Eora to construct a multi‐regional input–output (MRIO) model of virtual water consumption and value‐added benefits among 189 countries and regions from 1991 to 2016. We also proposed a virtual water consumption uneven index. The results highlight that relatively less developed regions accounted for 27% of the world's total export value added and 56% of virtual water exports. In contrast, relatively developed regions contributed 73% of the global export value added but only 44% of virtual water exports. The export of high‐value‐added products, such as financial services, was concentrated in the relatively developed regions, while water‐intensive products, like agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, were mainly exported by relatively less developed regions. Economically developed regions enjoyed a beneficiary position in terms of virtual water consumption, with each unit of export‐driven added value requiring only 4–100 kg of virtual water. Conversely, economically less developed regions consumed 140–1800 kg of virtual water per unit of export‐driven added value. The disparities in virtual water exchanges across different regions primarily stem from the differences between developed and less developed regions. Therefore, less developed regions and countries should focus on improving water efficiency in water‐consuming industries, adjusting the structure of export industries, and striving to reduce or reverse the disadvantageous position of resource consumption, such as virtual water, in global trade exports.",2024-09-04,

Corporate Value Assessment based on the EVA Model and Relative Valuation,"As a risk-averse commodity, gold has seen new development opportunities in retail due to factors (e.g., geopolitical risks and conflicts, economic uncertainties, and inflation). Consequently, more and more investors are focusing on the gold retail industry. Evaluating the value of gold retail enterprises using scientific and effective methods is of great significance to both managers and investors. Therefore, this paper uses Chow Tai Seng, a Chinese gold retail enterprise, as a case study. Based on the company's development characteristics, we employ the EVA absolute valuation method and relative valuation methods including P/E, P/B and P/S ratios for valuation. The study finds that although its EVA values show a general downward trend from 2019 to 2023, they remain positive, indicating that the company's overall development is still on track. The development of enterprise valuation theory has gone through the MM (Modigliani-Miller) theory, Free Cash Flow Valuation Model, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model, among others. These theoretical models have gradually improved, and the theoretical system is continuously evolving. By summarizing and reviewing valuation theories and methods, this paper employs the DDM for valuation and the P/E ratio method under relative valuation based on the company's development characteristics. Combining these two valuation methods with the company's actual financial data and relevant value theories, the company can attract investors and address undervaluation by increasing its exposure through modern multimedia channels and enhancing data transparency.",2024-09-01,

Research on Problems and Solutions of Quantitative Investment in the Chinese Market,"Quantitative investment has gradually become increasingly important in the Chinese finance market in recent decades. It improves the efficiency of investment, reduces the risk of investment, enhances the liquidity of some market assets and provides new opportunities to accumulate wealth for investors. As a new investment method, it raises some problems which lead to the turmoil of the market when it keeps developing and gaining traction. This paper will review the current situation of quantitative investment in the Chinese market from its development history and the sizes of funds. This study shows that there are mainly four problems existing in the application of quantitative investment in China. Listed below are problems. The evident government intervention in the market has a negative impact on the fitting effectiveness of quantitative models. Some kinds of assets and commodities face poor liquidity and for them, quantitative investment strategies can hardly be conducted accurately. The accuracy of quantitative analysis can be unreliable for the financial data is sometimes incomplete and unreliable in the Chinese market. The high-frequency trading affects the stability of the whole market because of lack of market supervision. This paper also puts forward relevant countermeasures and suggestions according to these problems. This study has great significance to the healthy development of quantitative investment in the Chinese market.",2024-09-01,
ATTRACTION OF RESOURCES TO UKRAINIAN AGRIBUSINESS THROUGH AGRARIAN RECEIPT: ACCOUNTING ASPECT,"The purpose of the study was to disclose the content of agrarian receipts and the mechanism for their application in the settlement system of Ukrainian agricultural producers as an alternative way to attract resources for doing business under martial law in Ukraine, as well as to make proposals for their accounting in order to avoid business risks. The state of lending to agricultural producers during martial law is analyzed and the importance of lending against agrarian receipts is substantiated. The experience of Brazil in the process of lending for the future harvest was assessed. The history of the introduction of agrarian receipts in Ukraine is characterized on the basis of borrowing the idea of Brazil. The essence of agrarian receipts is revealed and the legal framework for their circulation in Ukraine is investigated. The difference between agrarian receipts and other financial instruments (bill, forward contract, pledge) is determined. The problematic aspects of the introduction of agrarian receipts into circulation, which hinder the effectiveness of the use of this tool by agricultural enterprises in the process of attracting financial resources, are systematized. The business models of relationships between counterparties in the process of circulation of agrarian receipts are characterized. Theoretical and practical aspects of accounting for agrarian receipts have been studied and problematic aspects in the methodology for reflecting settlements by agrarian receipts in the system of accounting accounts have been identified. Organizational, methodological and practical recommendations are proposed aimed at improving the procedure for recording transactions with commodity agrarian receipts in the accounting system as an innovative way of financing agricultural producers at the domestic and international levels. This will make it possible to quickly collect data on the circulation of agrarian receipts and improve information support in making managerial decisions by various groups of Ukrainian and foreign stakeholders.",2024-08-31,

Анализируется передовая инвестиционная методология для эффективного управления инвестициями в будущем. With the rapid development of China’s economy, the wealth of Chinese residents has been growing cumulatively along with the dividends of the era of reform and opening up. By the end of 2023, the balance of China’s residents’ deposits had reached about 137.88 trillion dollars, and the accompanying investment and wealth management boom among residents was even more booming. By the end of 2023, the size of securities investment funds of various investment types that accompany them amounted to $27.6 trillion, and the number of products is also growing rapidly. Of course, investors face increasing challenges when choosing funds: whether to invest in bonds, stocks, futures or commodities; whether to invest in the U.S. market, the Chinese market, or the emerging markets of Europe or Southeast Asia. In order to meet this challenge, an index called “Wind Equity Mixed” has emerged in China’s investment market and has attracted much attention due to its long term outperformance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the various characteristics of the Wind Parity Mixed Fund Index, and to introduce and analyze how we use financial engineering and computerized quantitative enhancement to enhance the strategy on the basis of the index, and to evaluate and validate the implementation of the process and conclusions. Through this paper, we aim to provide our readers and investors with an in-depth introduction to how intelligent computer modeling can help us better invest our funds and manage our wealth in the current development of the digital economy, as well as to introduce this cutting-edge investment methodology and logic, and to look forward together to the new trends of investment management in the future.",2024-08-31,
Price processes in the global gold market,"Recurring global crises, increasing uncertainty in the world economy, rising geopolitical risk and recently geoeconomic fragmentation have renewed and intensified interest in gold in the 21st century. The precious metal still retains an important role in the economy, most notably as a long-term store of value and efficient portfolio diversifier. One of the most remarkable changes on the global gold market refers to the role of central banks. Over several decades after the breakup of the Bretton Woods system, central banks were selling gold held in their reserves. However, following the global financial crisis central banks ceased to be a source of gold supply and became a significant component of global demand for gold. We demonstrate that gold remains valuable and expensive in terms of both currencies and other commodities. Moreover, its record prices are a result of rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty as well as the resurrection of inflationary pressures. We argue that gold prices are also overwhelmingly influenced by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and the US dollar exchange rate. On the other hand, the rapid increase in the price of gold reflects rising income and private demand for gold in emerging market economies, particularly in China and India. The purpose of the article is to assess the value of gold using a wide range of metrics as well as to present the determinants of gold prices, with special attention given to demand and supply fundamentals and financial instruments based on gold. The research methods used include statistical-descriptive analysis, comparative analysis and literature study.",2024-08-31,
"Implementing Social Media Management Against Sustainability Business on the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises","The goal of a sustainable business strategy is to create long-term value for the firm, its stakeholders, and society at large by integrating economic, environmental, and social objectives into corporate goals, actions, and planning. It has long been believed that developing value outside of these parameters is illegitimate. Among the emerging nations that continues to protect micro, small, and medium-sized businesses is Indonesia. MSMEs, or micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, are the foundation of the economy. The government has worked very hard to maintain and grow MSMEs in the community. MSMEs are divided into a number of sectors by the regional administration, including trade, home industry, agriculture, food, fisheries, handicrafts, and other industries. Today's MSMEs face several obstacles, including disorganized data and a dearth of industrial facilities capable of producing commodities with significant added value. The government's financial and aid initiatives are frequently off course due to irregularities and disorganized data. Additionally, the government is currently concentrating on enhancements to facilitate better organization of MSMEs data. One significant initiative that will be carried out in the nation is the strengthening and transformation of the digital ecosystem. The secret to accelerating recovery and boosting the competitiveness of the national economy, particularly raising MSMEs' productivity and performance, is to digitize rural areas faster than cities",2024-08-30,
The Accounting Treatment of Cryptocurrencies: The Perspective of Current Accounting Standards,"Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies void of any support from regulatory body that is currently in vogue as a medium of exchange and an investment security. This paper examines the accounting treatment for cryptocurrency from the perspective of IFRS and AAOIFI accounting standards and propose actions to standard setters on the best way to treat the Crypto transactions in accounting reports. A proper accounting treatment will allow for a fair reporting of crypto related transactions and facilitate users of financial statements to make objective assessment of this new invention. A content analysis was conducted to review all major accounting standards issued by accounting standards setting bodies for possible accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies. To better understand the issue in practice, an analysis of accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies by 2 companies also was conducted. This study found that there is no suitable accounting standard that could objectively be applied for cryptocurrencies. For example, from the perspective of the current accounting standards, cryptocurrencies match the definition of inventory if it is used as a commodity for broker-trader and intangible asset for others respectively. It is suggested that there an urgent need for the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to comprehensively develop accounting standard for cryptocurrency, specifically to develop a specific category for this type of assets to allow a standard treatment for cryptocurrency and fill the gap in the IFRS.",2024-08-30,

Formation of the prerequisites of the analysis of investment activities to the era of the establishment of the market economy,"The paper is devoted to the study of the prerequisites for the development of investment activity analysis before the era of the formation of a market economy in the countries of European civilization. In the 21st century, investment activity has gained particular importance, and understanding the historical aspects of economic relations and accounting practices is crucial for its effective analysis. For this purpose, the paper systematizes and periodizes the stages of development of accounting and economic analysis, starting from the early civilizations up to the end of the 19th century. The research employs a comprehensive set of methods, including dialectical, historical, abstract-logical, methods of induction and deduction, as well as expert evaluation and comparison methods. The application of these methods allowed for the identification of patterns in the development of accounting and economic activity analysis in connection with the evolution of socio-economic relations. Significant attention is given to the analysis of the stages of accounting development, starting from its primitive forms in a natural economy to the emergence of complex accounting and analysis systems in the context of expanding commodity-money relations and the establishment of capitalist relations. The development of economic theory concepts, particularly mercantilism, physiocracy, classical and neoclassical theories, which influenced the formation of approaches to accounting and analysis, is also examined. The research results indicate that the development of investment activity was closely linked with the evolution of economic relations, the growth of production scales, trade, and financial market services. Important prerequisites for the formation of investment analysis included the emergence of the institution of property, the development of commodity-money relations, and the need to account for and analyze capital to manage resources effectively. The paper also systematizes information about the formation of investment analysis, which initially had an empirical nature and, with the development of accounting and economic theory, adopted a systematic approach. This laid the foundation for modern investment analysis, which is an important tool for making managerial decisions in a market economy. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of a historical approach to studying the development of accounting and analysis, which allows for a better understanding of modern trends and challenges in the field of investment activity.",2024-08-30,

Prospects for applying deep learning models in economics and finance,"The article is devoted to the study of the prospects of applying deep learning models in the field of economics and finance. The main types of deep learning architecture that have been applied in the economic sphere are identified. Based on the analysis of publications, the main areas of application of deep learning models in economics are identified, namely in the areas of macroeconomics and microeconomics for analyzing consumer behavior, pricing strategies, and competition. It is noted that most of the work on using machine learning models for market analysis relates to financial markets rather than commodity markets. More deep learning models must be developed for most goods and services markets. It has been established that the financial sector is one of the critical areas for using deep learning models. In the financial sector, deep learning is used for analyzing the situation in the financial sector and forecasting financial market indicators (stock prices, exchange rates, and cryptocurrencies); analysis of financial statements; analysis and management of risks (credit risk analysis, fraud detection, securities portfolio risk analysis, securities portfolio optimization), etc. The following areas of application of deep learning models are considered: financial market forecasting, foreign exchange market forecasting, algorithmic trading, credit risk analysis and assessment, and fraud detection. The author identifies several problems and limitations of using deep learning models in economics and finance: lack of research comprehensiveness; problem of bringing to a single period; problem of availability and quality of source data; need for large amounts of data for model training; complexity of interpretation; risk of overfitting models; limited computing resources. It is concluded that deep learning has proven to be effective in forecasting economic indicators by analyzing large and complex data sets to identify patterns and create accurate forecasts.

Currency Exchange Rate Volatility as A Moderating Effect of The Gold and Coal Price Against Fund Age and Mutual Fund in Indonesia,"Abstract Shifts in gold and coal prices have a crucial impact on the macro economy, especially investment growth. On a financial scale, there is still little discussion of the relationship between gold and coal prices and stock mutual funds. Also, the role of exchange rates and interest rates in moderating this relationship has not been examined. This research reviews the performance of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the scope of fund age and Indonesian stock mutual funds which are influenced by gold and coal prices with the moderating effect of interest rates and exchange rates. Core data was obtained from 20 companies as mutual fund owners officially registered with the Financial Services Authority (OJK) throughout 2019–2022. By operating Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA) into SmartPLS 4, there are interactions between prices and exchange rates, prices and interest rates, and prices and gold prices. As with the relationship between the age of ETF mutual funds traded on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) and the gold price, these two variables have a strong and positive correlation. This implies that relatively small changes in gold prices over the monitoring period may impact the fund age ETF. This positive association shows that an ETF investment can have its life extended by a relatively small increase in gold prices. This research indicates a strong causality, which improves the ETF’s performance on the IDX as fund age rises. Furthermore, the second model examines how fund age, gold, and coal have a direct impact on ETF mutual fund performance. It also looks closely at how indirectly coal, gold, and fund age affect ETF performance. The age of the fund, gold, coal, and exchange rates affect the performance of ETFs. While the effect is not statistically significant, interest rates, gold, coal, and fund age have a beneficial impact on ETF performance. Implications for policy makers to monitor and re-evaluate commodity price fluctuations using mining production regulation scenarios that are balanced with quality. Weaknesses of the current study such as the observation period need to be taken into consideration in future research.",2024-08-29,
Navigating the shadows: exports and money laundering dynamics in Bangladesh,"Purpose This study aims to analyze the complex dynamics of money laundering (ML) in the export sector of developing countries, with a special focus on Bangladesh. It aims to uncover the strategies and tactics money launderers use to exploit export transactions and understand the vulnerabilities that exist in economies where enforcement agencies neglect the export industry. Design/methodology/approach This study examines Bangladesh’s export sector ML using qualitative methods. Customs officers, central bank officers, port authorities and selected exporters were interviewed semi-structured. Document analysis of Bangladesh Bank orders, media and Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate reports was also done. Qualitative data patterns were identified using theme analysis. Findings The study identifies the most vulnerable export commodities – readymade garments, agricultural items and processed foods – as prime targets for ML. Key methods of laundering include under-invoicing, over-invoicing, misdeclaration and fake documentation. The research highlights the significant risk posed by the improper use of government financial incentives and introduces the “sample shipment” method as a novel laundering tactic. The findings underscore the need for stronger oversight and controls to mitigate these risks. Research limitations/implications This research is limited by single-point data because ML is a continual activity. The reliance on case studies from newspaper reports and online platforms introduces a degree of selection bias and the chosen instances may not comprehensively represent the broader landscape of trade-based ML. Practical implications The study provides several practical recommendations for policymakers and law enforcement agencies to fortify the export sector against exploitation by money launderers, ensuring greater transparency and accountability in international trade operations. Social implications By closing loopholes in the export sector, the research supports the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 16.4, which aims to reduce illicit financial flows, thereby contributing to poverty eradication and economic stability in developing countries. Originality/value Original research results supported by technical analysis are presented in this work. It contributes to the body of knowledge by detailing the adaptive strategies of money launderers and proposing targeted recommendations for enhancing the integrity of the export sector.",2024-08-28,
Comparing the great recession and <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 using Long Short‐Term Memory: A close look into agricultural commodity prices,"Abstract We employ a neural network (NN) approach—Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM)—to study agricultural commodity prices during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID‐19 recession. Our analysis reveals more structural breaks and higher volatility in plant‐based commodities like corn and soybeans during recessions compared with animal‐based commodities. The price reactions varied among commodities, with corn responding first to both recessions, while milk price, which was found independent of other prices, recovered last from the financial recession and first from the disease‐induced recession. This insight into commodity behavior during recessions can aid in trend prediction and recession preparation for investors and researchers.",2024-08-28,
Demystifying Financial Speculation in Commodity Future Markets of Emerging Economies,"Present study focuses on comparing financial speculation on commodity future markets of China and India. Two agricultural products and two metal products were chosen from both countries for the present study. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning over twenty years, we employ quantitative methods to measure the hedging and speculative ratios within Chinese and Indian commodity future markets. Relevant results and visual representations were extracted using EVIEWS. Outcome of the study demonstrated that Indian commodity future markets are more speculative than Chinese commodity future markets both in cases of agricultural and metal products. The results will provide valuable implications for policymakers and market participants aiming to compare financial speculation in commodity markets vis-à-vis emerging economies like China and India. Additionally, the outcomes of this study are particularly relevant for market players, and policymakers to comprehend the mind-set/behavioural pattern of investors trading in Chinese and Indian commodity future markets.",2024-08-28,
Cryptocurrencies: hedging or financialization? behavioral time series analyses,"This article investigates the time-series properties of cryptocurrency returns and compares them with currency and commodity returns. We perform and analyze the mean reversion, normality, unit root, high and low returns, correlation, Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) [2,2], Autoregressive (AR) [5], and long-run components in the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) [1,1] estimates. We also perform regression analyses to evaluate two possible behavioral biases: familiarity and disposition effect. Our time series analysis documents that cryptocurrencies are neither currencies nor commodities. We also show that adding cryptocurrency to a portfolio increases market efficiency and uncertainty. We also document that cryptocurrency investors exhibit the same familiarity and disposition effect biases as commodity and currency investors. Overall, we conclude that investors in cryptocurrencies tend to underestimate risk and misestimate future prices, as they do in commodity and currency markets. This study makes at least three contributions to the literature. First, we evaluate whether cryptocurrencies tend to hedge or financialization. Second, our analysis includes both univariate and portfolio dimensions. Third, this is a pioneering study on using behavioral bias analysis to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a commodity or a currency.",2024-08-28,
"Husbands and wives: power, peril and female participation in a Ugandan coffee cooperative","Purpose Female smallholder farmers in low-income countries face barriers to accessing capital and commodity markets. While agricultural cooperatives provide services that contribute to the income and productivity of small-scale producers, evidence of cooperatives' social and economic empowerment of female smallholders remains limited. We apply Sen's capability approach to female entrepreneurs' socioeconomic empowerment to examine whether women's participation in a coffee and microfinance cooperative from rural western Uganda benefits their social and economic position within their household. First, we study the relationship between women's cooperative participation and their household coffee sales and savings. Second, we investigate the link between women's cooperative participation and their intra-household decision-making and whether the inclusion of the husband in his wife's cooperative strengthens or lowers women's decision-making power. Design/methodology/approach We carry out a case study of a hybrid coffee and microfinance cooperative that promotes social innovation through the integration and empowerment of female smallholders in rural Uganda. Using a cross-sectional survey of 411 married female cooperative members from 26 randomly selected self-help groups of Bukonzo Joint Cooperative and 196 female non-members from the identical area, employing propensity score matching, this paper investigates the benefits of women's participation in a coffee and microfinance cooperative in the Rwenzori Mountains of western Uganda. We present and discuss the results of our case study within an extensive literature on the role of institutions in collective action for women's empowerment. Findings Our findings provide new empirical evidence on female smallholders' participation in mixed cooperatives. Our results indicate that women's participation in microfinance-producer cooperatives appears to be a conditional blessing: even though membership is linked to increased women's intra-household decision-making and raised household savings and income from coffee sales, a wife with a husband in the same cooperative self-help group is associated with diminished women's household decision-making power. Research limitations/implications The focus of this study is on female coffee smallholders in an agricultural cooperative in rural western Uganda. In particular, we focus on a case study of one major coffee cooperative. Our cross-sectional survey does not allow us to infer causal interpretations. Also, the survey does not include variables that allow us to measure other dimensions of women's empowerment beyond decision-making over household expenditures and women's financial performance related to savings and income from coffee cultivation. Practical implications Our empirical results indicate that female smallholders' cooperative membership is associated with higher incomes and coffee sales. However, husband co-participation in their wives' cooperative group diminishes wives' decision-making, which suggests that including husbands and other family members in the same cooperative group may not be perceived as an attractive route to empowerment for female smallholders. For these reasons, an intervention that encourages the cooperation of both spouses and that is sensitive to context-specific gender inequalities, may be more successful at stimulating social change toward household gender equality than interventions that focus on women's autonomous spheres only. Originality/value While the literature thus far has focused on microfinance's potential for women's empowerment, evidence on agricultural cooperatives' affecting women's social and economic position is limited. First, our findings provide novel empirical evidence on the empowering effects of women's participation in a self-help group-based coffee cooperative in rural Uganda. Second, our data allows us to explore the role of husbands' participation in their wives' cooperative and SGH. We embed our hypotheses and empirical results in a rich discussion of female entrepreneurship, microfinance and cooperative literature.",2024-08-27,

An analytical study on value chain finance to tomato and mango as a component of high value agriculture in the Eastern Uttar Pradesh of India.,"The study conducted an extensive field survey utilizing pre-tested interview schedules with tomato and mango growers and chain actors. A multi-stage purposive-cum-stratified random sampling method was employed to select sample units. The findings of this study highlight the cost orientation of tomato and mango production, indicating a greater need for consequential credit. The research revealed that growers of both commodities within fragmented value chains had a higher proportionate share in the value addition (price) than growers in integrated chains, primarily due to direct sales of produce to consumers. Additionally, downstream actors such as commission agents, wholesalers, and retailers received a comparatively higher proportionate share in the value additions (price) compared to upward actors, indicating that producers could not effectively compete with increased demand in the marketplace. Observations within the chain indicated that finance for tomato and mango production circulated through a product commitment relationship established between chain participants. Downstream actors provided financing to upstream actors from either their surplus funds or external finance received from financial institutions. The study suggests developing a producer-driven chain financing model as an alternative to the buyer-driven financing model for tomato and mango production. This could be achieved by promoting farmers' organizations as long-term financing strategies for financing institutions.",2024-08-25,
Curbing alcohol-associated liver disease by increasing alcohol excise taxes,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is caused by long-term heavy alcohol consumption. The disease is still a significant contributor to the morbidity burden of liver diseases in America and some European countries. A trend of increasing incidence of ALD has also been observed in Asia over the past two decades.[1] Alcohol excise taxes are taxes imposed on alcoholic beverages and these taxes are typically included in the product price. Increasing the alcohol excise taxes is among the most efficient and cost-effective interventions for reducing excessive consumption of alcohol in the population. Increasing alcohol excise taxes indirectly increases the price of alcohol, which may exceed some consumers' intention or purchase ability, thereby reducing alcohol use and misuse. A study showed that doubling of spirits excise taxes would reduce per capita consumption of spirits by 8–10%, while the number of cases requiring liver transplantation for ALD would decrease by 6–7%.[2] There is considerable heterogeneity in excise tax design across countries and beverage types. Therefore, we take spirits as an example to briefly describe the excise tax policies of different countries. Regional median excise taxes account for the highest share of the price for spirits (21.4%) in the Americas.[3] In the European Union, the highest excise taxes are applied in Finland, Sweden, and Ireland, where the rates for a standard-size bottle of liquor are 16.08 dollars, 15.73 dollars, and 13.59 dollars, respectively. In China, the proportional tax rate for grain and potato liquor is 20%, and the fixed tax rate is 0.5 Yuan/500 g or 0.5 Yuan/500 mL. Determining the suitability of this policy in the local context and ensuring its effectiveness are key challenges encountered by policymakers. Herein, we discuss the factors that influence the effectiveness of increasing alcohol excise taxes in reducing the harmful use of alcohol. This article may help inform policymakers of the significance of taxation policy as a means to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, thereby reducing the enormous burden associated with ALD. World Health Organization (WHO) has identified three key factors that affect the effectiveness of taxation policy, i.e., tax pass-through, price elasticity of demand (PED), and unrecorded alcohol. Tax pass-through: Excise taxation works by increasing alcohol prices, and the degree to which the taxes translate into changes in consumer prices is often called pass-through. Therefore, the higher the degree of tax pass-through, the better the effect of the alcohol price increase. However, the degree of pass-through depends on several factors and circumstances. As increased taxes will raise the price of alcohol, the effectiveness mainly depends on alcohol retailers passing the tax increase on to the consumers.[4] In the off-trade (e.g., liquor stores, supermarkets), price increases for the cheapest 15% of products fall below the duty increases (undershifting), while price increases for the products with above-median prices fall above duty increases (overshifting).[5] This phenomenon was also observed in the on-trade (e.g., bars and restaurants). Undershifting is liable to weaken the effect of increasing taxes on alcohol consumption. A broadly similar point was recently made by Parikh et al[6] who found that, when price may not be sensitive to increases in tax, tax-related policies may fail to improve ALD mortality. PED: PED, also known as price sensitivity, is an economic index that quantitatively measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price. The law of demand states that when the price of a commodity increases, the demand decreases. Therefore, the greater the PED, the more effective the pricing strategy. As a typical consumer product, the PED for alcoholic beverages may have a relatively inelastic demand (0 < PED < 1). Relatively inelastic demand is defined as the proportionate change produced in demand that is lesser than the proportionate change in the price of a product. PED for alcohol is heterogeneous and affected by several factors, including the type of alcoholic beverage as well as the gender, age, drinking pattern, and socioeconomic status (SES). These are also the risk factors for ALD. Thus, a more detailed account of PED based on different risk factors is provided below. Alcoholic beverage type: Globally, the main types of alcoholic beverages are spirits and beer, which are also associated with a high risk of ALD. Wagenaar et al[7] analyzed data from 112 studies (primarily conducted in high-income countries) and reported a mean PED of 0.46 for beer and 0.80 for spirits. Interestingly, Sornpaisarn et al[8] analyzed 10 studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries and observed similar estimates of 0.50 for beer and 0.79 for other alcohols (including spirits). These results suggest that higher prices are likely to reduce the demand for liquor and beer, especially spirits, in all countries, irrespective of income level. However, the impact of alcohol prices and/or taxation on alcohol consumption has not been investigated in some countries or regions (especially in low- and middle-income areas). Therefore, the generalizability of the above results needs to be confirmed. Gender: In most countries or regions, men consistently drink more than three times as much as women, so the ALD population is predominantly male. Gender differences in drinking preferences may lead to much less price sensitivity for men than women. Overall, adult men have fewer elastic demands compared with women. However, there are significant differences in gender responsiveness to price changes in different countries or regions. For example, PED was only 0.03 for men and virtually zero for women in China. However, in Italy, the reported short-run elasticity for men was 0.37–0.56, and for women was 0.57–1.24. Therefore, the alcohol taxation policies should be cognizant of the local context. Age: ALD incidence peaks in middle age, but it takes at least 10 years for long-term heavy drinking to progress to ALD; therefore, adolescents and young adults who consume alcohol are potentially high-risk groups. Additionally, studies have demonstrated an association between early drinking and AUD in adulthood. However, a meta-analysis of 132 studies, mainly from Western countries, showed that adolescents (age <18 years) were almost insensitive to price changes in alcoholic beverages. Therefore, covering this part of the population seems challenging through a price-raising policy alone. Drinking patterns: There are various types of drinking patterns, including daily alcohol consumption, drinking frequency, and drinking with meals. Special attention needs to be paid to people with high-risk drinking patterns because they may be at higher risk of ALD. Studies have shown that compared to moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers and alcoholics are somewhat less price-sensitive for alcohol addiction and show a preference for low-price alcoholic beverages. Therefore, it is difficult to reduce their alcohol consumption by pricing strategies. SES: SES refers to a composite measure of a person's economic and social position in relation to others, based on income, education, and occupation. There is a famous paradox of alcohol harm, that is, lower SES leads to a 1.5–2-fold higher mortality from alcohol-attributable causes compared with all causes. Studies have demonstrated that low-income drinkers have a stronger responsiveness than high-income drinkers. Therefore, tax increases may be more suitable for countries or regions with an underdeveloped economy but a high burden of ALD, such as Asia.[1] Unrecorded alcohol: Unrecorded alcohol is defined as alcohol that is consumed but is not registered in official statistics for sales, production, or trade. An estimated 25% of worldwide alcohol consumption is unrecorded. Unrecorded alcohol can undermine the impact of cost-effective alcohol control interventions. As there is no tax on unrecorded alcohol, there is an unfair price advantage compared to recorded alcohol. This pricing disparity may be exacerbated by increasing alcohol excise taxes, driving consumers, particularly low-income drinkers, to switch to unrecorded alcohol and contributing to higher rates of chronic and irregular heavy drinking. The epidemiology of unrecorded alcohol consumption varies in different countries/regions. For example, industrially manufactured spirits were found to be most common in India. Cross-border shopping was reported as the most prevalent method of obtaining unrecorded alcohol in parts of Europe. Therefore, regional initiatives tailored to local socioeconomic realities are frequently required to regulate the availability and price of alcohol in order to reduce the harm caused by unrecorded alcohol consumption. Improving ALD management policies: There are downsides to increasing alcohol excise taxes, such as imposing a heavier financial burden on individuals with low incomes and interfering with the operations of bars. Therefore, increasing alcohol excise taxes as a measure to reduce alcohol consumption may not be universally appropriate for all countries. Assuming undershifting of low-price alcoholic beverages, a low PED (from the perspective of targeting high-risk groups for ALD, increasing alcohol excise taxes are typically less effective for adolescents, young adults, and heavy drinkers) and high levels of unrecorded alcohol consumption, using tax policies to address excessive drinking and alleviate the burden of ALD would be ineffective. It may even lead to and aggravate adverse outcomes. However, determining the optimal level of taxation that maximizes policy advantages poses significant challenges; it should be based on more than just minimum alcohol consumption but evaluated in conjunction with other indicators, including tax burdens and economic conditions. Further research is needed in this area. To summarize, the establishment of other public health policies is imperative. Studies have demonstrated that more restrictive alcohol-related policy environments are associated with lower overall ALD mortality, including liver cancer.[6,9] Minimum unit pricing (MUP) introduces a minimum price below which a unit of pure alcohol cannot be sold to consumers. MUP can not only maintain the effectiveness of alcohol tax policy but also weaken the impact of undershifting. A recent study showed that MUP in Scotland was associated with a 13.4% and 4.1% reduction in deaths and hospitalizations wholly attributable to alcohol consumption. The effects were driven by significant improvements in chronic outcomes dominated by ALD.[10] Adolescent drinking is a complex problem and is hard to solve by any single policy. Therefore, Iceland has implemented a combination of alcohol control policies, such as family commitments and increased after-school activities, which helped reduce alcohol use among younger individuals from 42% to 5% in 20 years. Abstinence is the ultimate treatment for ALD and reduced alcohol consumption can lead to rapid improvements in individuals with established cirrhosis. Avanceña et al's[11] study demonstrated that medication-assisted therapy and clinician counseling for patients in the compensatory stage of alcoholic cirrhosis were extremely cost-effective strategies for reaching abstinence and even delaying the occurrence of decompensated events. In conclusion, increasing alcohol excise taxes as a policy intervention against ALD should be preceded by an analysis of the local context and the key factors affecting the policy effectiveness, including tax pass-through, PED, and unrecorded alcohol. Additionally, synergistic use of a number of public measures is more conducive to ALD management. Public health policymakers should attach greater importance to the development of an effective, population-based blueprint for action to reduce the burden of ALD.

The Key Role of Cooperatives in Sustainable Agriculture and Agrifood Security: Evidence from Greece,"This research investigated the role of agricultural cooperatives (ACs) in promoting sustainable agriculture and agrifood security, with a particular emphasis on Greece. A cross-sectional survey technique was employed, and data were collected from 400 farmers and professionals either employed by or associated with Greek agricultural cooperatives by administering an online questionnaire. A response rate of 96.5% was achieved. The study findings show that cooperative techniques bring about a positive shift in agrifood security and sustainable agriculture. Particularly, participants concurred that resource sharing among cooperative members increases farm productiveness and sustainability by 94.2% while improving access to credit and financial support by 91.5%. Moreover, 84.3% agreed that access to up-to-date information enhances the practice of sustainable agriculture, and 95.1% agreed that collective bargaining through cooperatives increases the prices of agricultural commodities. Regarding the application of advanced technologies in cooperative practices, 96.7% of the participants acknowledged that it improved farm efficiency. The cooperative model demonstrates how agricultural expansion may be achieved by collective bargaining, information sharing, resource sharing, and technological integration, while also considerably improving agrifood security and sustainability. These findings highlight the crucial importance of cooperatives in increasing the level of agricultural production, ensuring sustainability, and improving agrifood security in Greece.",2024-08-22,

Review: Impact of food safety on global trade,"Food safety encompasses the supply and assurance of safe, high-quality food for consumers. It is a crucial aspect of food security, gaining greater global attention due to the increasing number of widespread foodborne incidents. International trade is expanding as countries increasingly rely on each other to secure a sufficient and diverse food supply. Beyond this, concerns about food safety have become more prevalent due to various factors. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the effects of food safety-associated risks on the international trade of food and related products. A total of 37 published studies retrieved using different search engines were included in this review. This review revealed that because of rapid population growth and rising food demand in developing nations, agricultural intensification is growing. It has been found that foodborne illnesses and associated discrepancies can impede the international trade of food commodities. Trade bans due to the fear of foodborne illnesses are growing. The consequences of foodborne diseases are multifaceted and include financial losses from trade restrictions, medical costs for prevention or control, resource depletion and a decline in food production. The overall effects are increased international trade tensions and livelihood vulnerability to poverty, notably for small-scale livestock producers. Potential food contaminants include microbes, pesticides, pharmaceutical residues, heavy metals and fraudulent such as improper food processing, mislabelling, poor packaging, adulteration and substitution. Hence, countries are encouraged to harmonize the rights and duties set by the World Trade Organization under sanitary and phytosanitarys to maximize their advantages in global markets. Based on this evidence, we recommend that each country develop and integrate regulations that would ensure the safety of both domestic and international food production systems. Furthermore, the global community should either revise the current functioning food regulatory and monitoring body or establish a more genuine collaborative network.",2024-08-19,
Financial contagion in raw materials markets during the COVID-19 pandemic,"During periods of global shocks in different markets, we often observe expansion of crisis processes, which can be considered from theoretical and methodological standpoint of financial contagion. This paper aims to study the features of financial contagion transmission in commodity markets under the influence of the pandemic shock. The authors generalize the approaches to understanding the essence of financial contagion, show the complexity and diversity of methods for its study, and give the results of modern research on this problem. The spread of financial contagion through the channels of exchange trade in commodities in the context of the pandemic shock is analyzed. Estimates of intra-market and inter-market contagion in 4 raw materials markets were obtained: energy carriers, precious metals, metals as raw materials for industrial production, agricultural products as raw materials for food industry. For paired bundles of commodities, one-dimensional GARCH models are constructed with the allocation of dynamic conditional correlations in the crisis and pre-crisis periods. Financial contagion was recorded with a significant increase in the average conditional correlations during the crisis period. A comparative analysis of the scale of infection allows us to draw conclusions on different resilience of commodity markets to a pandemic shock. Estimates of intra-market contagion show that most susceptible to infection are the markets of ordinary and precious metals. The energy market turned out to be the most stable, the agricultural products market took an intermediate position. Taking into account the effects of inter-market contagion confirmed a high level of susceptibility to contagion of precious metals market, and also allowed for the ranking of commodity futures by the degree of contagion during the COVID-19 period. On this basis, it is concluded that in conditions of a pandemic, investments in gold are not an effective hedging tool. Some agricultural futures (for pork and oats) may act as diversifiers of investment portfolio, since test statistics confirmed a minimum number of cases of contagion.",2024-08-19,
Commodification Of Education In Transactional Leadership [A Literature Review Study],"Higher education is increasingly seen as a commodity that can be bought and sold in the global market. This phenomenon emerges along with the development of a culture of capitalism that penetrates into the academic realm. This research examines the role of transactional leadership in the commodification of higher education in Indonesia. Using a case study approach of literature review from various journals, this research investigates how transactional leadership practices contribute to the transformation of education into an economically fungible product. The research findings reveal that transactional leadership encourages the creation of a management system that is oriented towards financial gain. Students are viewed as consumers, while education becomes a service that must be sold competitively. Transactional leaders tend to adopt business strategies such as aggressive marketing, diversification of study programs, and exploitation of human resources to maximize institutional income. Furthermore, this study analyzes the impact of education commodification on learning quality, academic integrity, and the welfare of the academic community. The results show that commodification can sacrifice essential aspects of education, such as intellectual development, character building, and the pursuit of scientific truth, in order to pursue financial goals. This study concludes that transactional leadership has the potential to change the face of higher education into a pure business activity, with significant consequences for the quality and purpose of education itself. The findings make an important contribution to the discussion on the direction of higher education in Indonesia and the role of leadership in determining the values embraced by educational institutions.",2024-08-19,
"Modelling Interdependence between Climatic Factors, Commodities, and Financial Markets","This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to studying the impact of climate-related factors on commodity and financial markets using network analysis. We utilize a Bayesian network Vector Autoregressive model to investigate whether climate risk significantly influ-ences commodity prices and financial market returns. Our findings provide evidence of a climate effect on major commodities and global financial markets. Specifically, we identify Crude oil, Cotton, and Sugar as the commodities most affected by climate risk, with Gold demonstrating the least susceptibility. Additionally, we observe that climate-related risk on commodities is likely propagated by patterns such as PNA, NN1, and AO. In terms of financial markets, we find that stock markets in Hong Kong, India, and Spain are the most susceptible to climate risk, while Switzerland's market appears to be the least affected. Furthermore, we document evidence that climate-related risk capable of altering financial markets is likely propagated by factors like ENP, NN1, and WH. Overall, our study underscores the intricate relationship between climate factors and market dynamics, highlighting the importance of considering climate risk in assessing market behavior and performance.",2024-08-19,
Six months of Javier Milei,"It has been 8 months since the inauguration of the Javier Milei administration. His rise to power marks an unprecedented event in Argentine politics. Until 2021, when he stepped into politics and ran for a deputy seat in the city of Buenos Aires, Milei, who besides his role as an economic advisor at Corporación América—a large business conglomerate—had been a frequent guest on television shows, levying strong criticism toward both Kirchnerism and Mauricio Macri's economic policies, advocating for a sharp reduction in the state apparatus and sweeping market reform aggressiveness displayed toward his critics and rivals. In 2021, he founded La Libertad Avanza, a small party that competed in that year's mid-term election, obtaining 17% of the vote in the city of Buenos Aires and gaining two Chamber of Deputies seats. While not uncommon in other countries, Javier Milei is the first case in Argentina of a presidential candidacy crafted on a television set and social media. His constant presence on shows made him popular across the country against the backdrop of the severe economic decay and deterioration of social indicators that Argentina has experienced over the past 14 years. To many observers, his unexpected victory in the November 19 presidential runoff was a major blow to Argentine politics and the country's establishment. His first-place showing in the August 13 presidential primaries had already dealt a shock to Argentina's political elites. There was some expectation before the August open, simultaneous, and compulsory primaries (PASO in Spanish) that Milei could end up being the candidate with the most votes at the individual level, but it was believed that the aggregate vote of the main opposition coalition Juntos por el Cambio and of the ruling Frente de Todos, both of which had competitive primaries, would surpass La Libertad Avanza's candidate. The election of outsiders has been a common phenomenon in Latin America since the beginning of the third wave of democratization, but until last year's election, Argentina had not experienced it. The resilience of Peronism and the strength of its partisan apparatus apparently posed a strong barrier for an outsider lacking a strong partisan structure. Furthermore, Argentina's electoral system stood as an obstacle to the rise of outsiders. The PASO, which have effectively turned the presidential election into a three-round system, and the use of paper ballots, which requires a large apparatus to monitor the electoral process, allegedly provided Argentine politics with a bullet-proof jacket that safeguarded its polity from outsiders. Yet, against all odds, Javier Milei surprisingly ended up as the candidate with the most votes in the August PASO, at 31%, dealing the first blow to Argentina's partisan establishment; he obtained 29% support in the October first round, placing him in second place behind Sergio Massa, whom he defeated in the November 19 runoff by a much larger margin than expected (Labaqui, 2023a). Elected with an 11-point advantage in the presidential second round, Milei's party only held 10% and 15% of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies seats, effectively becoming Argentina's weakest head of state in legislative terms since the democratic restoration in 1983. As is well known, Milei's initial economic package resulted in an acceleration of Argentina's already high inflation rate, presumably leading to a further deterioration of poverty rates and deepening the pre-existing decline in economic activity. Yet, after 6 months in office, Milei's approval ratings remained surprisingly high, according to various public opinion polls raising questions about social tolerance to fiscal austerity and economic adjustment. In this sense, Milei's rise in Argentine politics poses a fascinating set of questions that are relevant both from an empirical and theoretical standpoint. As stated, the rise of populist outsiders (and as I shall describe later, this label fits Milei's leadership strategy and style perfectly) has not been unusual in Latin America but is rather uncommon in Argentina.1 By this token, it is worth questioning what lies behind his stunning ascent to power. The emergence of populist leaders has typically been associated with the deinstitutionalization of party systems (Levitsky & Loxton, 2013; Mainwaring, 2018; Mainwaring & Scully, 1995). The press usually compares Milei's triumph to Donald Trump's 2016 victory in the United States and Jair Bolsonaro's in Brazil. There is more recent literature on the surge of a new illiberal and populist right both globally and in the region (Luna & Rovira-Kaltwasser, 2021; Monestier & Vommaro, 2021). Theoretical discussions about populism are also relevant to understanding Milei. The blend of populism and economic liberalism is hardly a new phenomenon in the region (Weyland, 1996). Milei's legislative weakness also brings back discussions about the elective affinities between neoliberalism and populism raised by Weyland (1996) and Roberts (1995) 30 years ago during the heyday of market reforms in Latin America. At the same time, Milei's quest for radical economic liberalization brings to the forefront debates regarding the political economy of stabilization plans and structural reforms and discussions about the functioning of minority governments under presidential regimes. Milei's presidency has also raised discussions about the consequences his arrival to power could have for Argentina's democracy. Levitsky and Loxton (2013) have argued that the election of a populist leader, especially in the case of outsiders, has usually resulted in the emergence of competitive authoritarian regimes. During the campaign for the 2023 runoff election, several organizations and intellectuals warned about the peril that Milei represented for the fate of Argentina's democracy (Clarín, 2023a). In this essay, I will address some of these questions. First, I will argue that Javier Milei's victory fits well with the existing knowledge about the circumstances that result in the election of populist leaders. Then, I will center on Milei's particular blend of populism, which, as noted, has not been an uncommon phenomenon in the region. In the fourth section, I assess the prospects for governability of Milei's administration. In the final section, I assess the first semester of Milei's tenure as president and discuss whether he poses a threat to Argentina's democracy. The August 13 primaries were a shock for Argentina's political establishment. After votes were counted, Milei surprisingly not only had the most votes as an individual candidate but also his newly formed political party La Libertad Avanza was in first place, outnumbering the until-then predominant political coalitions—the ruling Peronist Unión Por la Patria and the center-right non-Peronist opposition Juntos por el Cambio. Although Argentina's party system had exhibited clear trends of deinstitutionalization since the mid-1990s (Gervasoni, 2018), it had not suffered a collapse of its party system like Venezuela and Bolivia in 1998 and 2005, respectively, or more recently in México with López Obrador's (AMLO) election in 2018, and in El Salvador in 2019. Even during the 2001–2002 economic crisis, despite the profound disenchantment with the partisan establishment, the party system did not break down completely but underwent a partial restructuring (Malamud & De Luca, 2015). The collapse of the convertibility regime certainly took a toll on the degree of institutionalization, but there was a more profound effect on the radical party than on Peronism (Escolar et al., 2002; Torre, 2003). The creation of Cambiemos in 2015—an alliance between Macri's Propuesta Republicana (PRO), the Unión Cívica Radical (UCR). and the Coalición Cívica—resulted in the first victory at the national level of a non-Peronist coalition since the demise of the Alianza—the coalition of the radical party and the center-left Frepaso—in 2001. Both the victory of Cambiemos (later rebranded as Juntos por el Cambio) in 2015 and the Peronist comeback (under the Frente de Todos label, which brought together different Peronist factions that had quit the party during the Kirchner era) in 2019 suggested that Argentine politics were evolving toward a two-coalition system. Paradoxically, the degree of institutionalization in partisan representation exhibited a sharp contrast with the disappointing performance of Argentina's ruling coalitions. The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated Argentina's economic problems. The Fernández administration's (2019–2023) decision to tie its fate to rigid enforcement of social distancing measures, coupled with the further economic deterioration brought about by the pandemic, provided the political space for the type of discourse Milei had been putting forth since his emergence in the public sphere, initially as an economic analyst who frequently participated on television shows. Bearing in mind Argentina's declining economic performance in the decade following the commodities boom of the 2000s, the question is not so much how Milei managed to defeat Argentina's partisan establishment but why it took so long to happen. A victory of Sergio Massa, who had been responsible for the Fernandez administration's economic policy since August 2022, would have been abnormal for a variety of reasons. From 2018 to 2023, the only ruling party that managed to win a presidential election in a democratic setting in Latin America was the Colorado Party in Paraguay. The poor economic performance of the Fernández administration, which saw a further acceleration of inflation particularly during Massa's tenure in the Ministry of Economy, made Argentina an unlikely candidate to break the regional anti-incumbent wave. See Table 1. Certainly, Massa was close to striking a first-round victory thanks to Argentina's presidential election rules that require 40% support and a 10-point advantage to avoid a second round. Since Massa had failed to avoid a runoff election, the likelihood of his victory was certainly low. In the first place, Massa failed to achieve a decisive lead in the first round. Reversal of the first-round result has occurred in 35% of elections decided through a second round in Latin America since the beginning of the third wave of democratization. Still, the phenomenon has become more frequent in recent years—12 of the 22 cases of runoff reversal have occurred within the last decade. See Table 2. Second, the poor economic performance of the Fernández administration and particularly of Massa as minister of economy made his triumph a highly unlikely event. Except for the case of Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil in 1994, no presidential candidate from a ruling party or coalition has won an election in Latin America since the beginning of the third wave of democratization when there has been an annual inflation rate above 40% (Labaqui, 2023a). See Table 3. Mainwaring (2018) has argued that poor government performance makes political parties vulnerable to profound electoral losses, effectively undermining the stability of the party system. The case of Argentina's 2023 election fits well with Mainwaring's argument. Not only did Peronism have its worst electoral showing in a presidential election since its emergence in Argentine politics in the 1940s, but also what until then had been the main opposition coalition, Juntos por el Cambio, underwent a dramatic electoral decline that left it out of the November 19 s round. Three consecutive administrations disappointed citizens' expectations, handing power to their successor in worse conditions than those they had received, creating the space for the surge of a populist outsider. Milei's emergence in Argentina's political landscape fits well with the literature on weak party-system institutionalization and with the more recent discussions on the emergence of a new type of political right in Latin America. Monestier and Vommaro (2021) have pointed out the recent cases of right-wing movements that won elections without previously building a political vehicle. According to them, this new right is based on personalistic leaders embracing a reactionary cultural and political anti-elitist discourse. This new far-right comes in hand with a new wave of populism, an old theme in Latin American politics. Milei would not see himself as a populist leader. In fact, he has frequently blamed populism as one of the causes behind Argentina's stagnation and decay (YouTube, 2022). Yet, his political strategy and style as well as his discourse are typical examples of populist leadership. Populism is a disputed concept. There are disagreements among scholars about its defining elements. The fact that populism is not only an analytical category but also a term frequently used in political discourse, usually with a negative connotation, adds to the controversy. Milei's adherence to economic liberalism and fiscal orthodoxy would not be an example of populism if we use Dornbusch and Edwards' (1991) definition, which confines the term to a type of economic policy, but the economic definition of populism is problematic for a variety of reasons. For one, many populist leaders have not hesitated on certain occasions to adopt fiscal austerity policies at odds with the economic definition of populism. Despite their differences, I find it more useful to use Weyland's (2001) and Barr's (2017) conceptualizations. Weyland (2001, p. 14) defines populism as a ""political strategy through which a personalistic leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct, unmediated, un-institutionalized support from large numbers of mostly unorganized followers."" According to Barr (2017, p. 44), ""populism is a means of building and/or maintaining political power based on the mass mobilization of supporters through the use of antiestablishment appeals and plebiscitarian linkages."" Milei is clearly a highly personalistic leader with a non-mediated, plebiscitarian bond with his followers. The fact that he obtained massive support in provinces where his own candidates had had a meager performance in local races held on a different date than the August primaries and the October first round evidence the personalistic and plebiscitarian nature of his leadership. Milei's antiestablishment appeals are also evident; his definition of Argentina's partisan establishment as a ""corrupt caste"" is a textbook case of the kind of discourse that leftist and right-wing populist leaders have used. Putting both Peronism and Juntos por el Cambio under the same label, caste was a key element in Milei's campaign strategy, which does not differ significantly from Bolsonaro's attacks on Brazil's partisan establishment, AMLO's accusations against the corruption of the ""PRIAN"" (Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] and National Action Party [PAN]), or Hugo Chávez's charges against the ""adecopeyano"" (from Venezuela's Democratic Action [Adecos] and Copei [Copeyos]) parties' patriarchy. Latin America has seen different waves of populism. During the late 1980s and 1990s, populist leaders, much to the surprise of many observers, embraced neoliberal economics. Until then, populism had been mostly associated with statism, economic nationalism, and fiscal profligacy, mainly based on the experiences of the 1930s–1950s in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, under Perón, Vargas, and Cárdenas, respectively. Weyland (1996) argues that populism and neoliberal economics were not at all incompatible, and in fact, had elective affinities. For different reasons, populist leaders and advocates of neoliberal reforms have targeted legislative assemblies and civil society organizations. Neoliberals see them as barriers to the swift adoption of economic reforms. The top-down unmediated nature typical of populist leaders is hardly compatible with a strong civil society. Similarly, the plebiscitarian and personalistic concept of democracy advocated by populists has usually resulted in a clash of powers with the legislative branch whenever they do not have a comfortable majority, which removes any notion of horizontal accountability. There is plenty of evidence that populism and checks and balances do not get along well. Like his peers Bolsonaro and Nayib Bukele, Milei has not refrained from levying harsh accusations against the legislative branch, although, unlike AMLO, he has so far not messed with the judiciary branch. After failing to get approval for the original version of his administration's first legislative proposal, the so-called ""ley bases,"" in the Chamber of Deputies in February, Milei labeled the Argentine Congress a ""nest of rats"" (Clarín, 2024). Milei's initial policy initiatives are in line with Weyland's analysis of the elective affinities between populism and neoliberalism. Shortly after being sworn in, Milei issued a highly ambitious and comprehensive Necessity and Urgency Decree covering a wide range of policy areas and launching a far-reaching deregulation of the economy.2 Shortly after, he sent to Congress an omnibus bill requesting a broad delegation of legislative powers in the executive branch and a declaration of emergency in nine policy areas—economic, fiscal, financial, social, social security, health, defense, security, and utilities tariffs. This lengthy bill also included a list of state-owned firms to be privatized and an electoral reform that scrapped Argentina's compulsory primaries system and adopted single-member districts for Congress, among other points (Infobae, 2023). The election of a populist outsider has often been the perfect recipe for an institutional crisis, as written by Levitsky and Loxton (2013). Populists do not like checks and balances. Furthermore, they rise to office with an anti-establishment appeal, which provides them with an incentive to overhaul the existing institutions. Unlike Hugo Chávez or Rafael Correa, Milei has neither the political tools nor the strength to proceed as they did during their first term in office. Milei's party, La Libertad Avanza, holds just 10% and 15% of seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, respectively. His legislative weakness raises an obvious concern about the prospects of governability for a head of state that lacks a strong legislative shield. Months before his election, I analyzed Milei's options in terms of governability (Labaqui, 2023b). Minority governments in presidential regimes can basically choose between (1) the ""delegative"" strategy accurately described by O'Donnell (1994), which consists of trying to exploit presidential popularity and the institutional tools available to the president to circumvent Congress; (2) coalition presidentialism, which basically consists of broadening the government's base of legislative support by incorporating other parties with congressional representation into the government, providing them positions in the executive branch (Chasquetti, 2001); and (3) crafting ad hoc majorities each time the executive leader sends a bill to Congress, an alternative that is painstaking and time and resource consuming. The Argentine Constitution endows the president with powerful tools to change the status quo, namely, necessity and urgency decrees and delegated powers. Still, both devices require some sort of congressional cooperation. Necessity and Urgency Decrees (DNUs) cannot be used for criminal, electoral, political party, and tax legislation and must be reviewed by Congress. The use of DNUs is regulated by article 99 item 3 of the Constitution and by Act 26.122. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner drafted the latter when she occupied a Senate seat and her husband was the head of state. Its provisions are heavily tilted in favor of the executive branch—the explicit rejection of both chambers of Congress is required to abrogate a DNU, which effectively means that a government controlling one chamber can block the repeal of a DNU. Milei, even with the support of the allied bloc, Propuesta Republicana (PRO), does not even reach one-third in the Senate or the Chamber of Deputies. Congress could eventually make the requirement for the legislative ratification of DNUs more stringent, for instance requiring both chambers' approval to uphold the decree and stipulating a deadline for floor discussion in each house. The delegation of legislative powers in turn requires a congressional bill. Delegated decrees are subject to a similar legislative oversight procedure. The temptation to rule by decree and circumvent a Congress might be tempting for a minority administration. Before Milei's inauguration, one prominent member of his team who would later be appointed as minister of Foreign Affairs stated publicly that if Congress did not cooperate, Milei would resort to DNUs to overcome legislative deadlock (Página 12, 2023). As analyzed above, this possibility is limited by both the Constitution and, in the case of administrations lacking at least a majority in one chamber, by the 26.122 act. Argentine presidents also have the possibility of calling for a nonbinding plebiscite. On several occasions before and after taking office, Milei suggested that he might resort to this alternative if Congress refused to pass his legislative proposals (Clarín, 2023b; El Cronista, 2023). Meanwhile, this alternative has limitations. According to Argentina's Constitution, suffrage is not compulsory for nonbinding popular consultations. The bill regulating this institutional device (25.432 act) limits the subjects that can be submitted to a referendum, specifically excluding those issues that require special legislative majorities (such as constitutional reform) and proposals that must be sent to specific chambers of Congress (such as the change in Argentina's revenue-sharing regime between the federal government and the provinces). From a more practical standpoint, recent evidence from Ecuador under Guillermo Lasso or Chile during the Boric administration shows that plebiscites can be a double-edged sword, especially in the case of heads of state that lack a majority in Congress. Milei's initial attempt to obtain a broad delegation of powers from Congress failed in February, when the Chamber of Deputies rejected certain items from the omnibus bill sent in December, leading the government to withdraw the entire bill. A much shorter and less ambitious version of the omnibus bill was resubmitted in April, considerably watered down during the legislative treatment in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. At the time of writing this article, Congress had passed this far less ambitious version of the so-called ""ley bases."" The bill's approval evidenced a more pragmatic approach from the Milei administration and a quick lesson about how minority administrations interact with Congress to get their policy proposals approved (Alles, 2024). The painstaking and resource-consuming discussion of the ley bases and the fiscal package submitted by the government in April 2024 underscores the advantages of coalition presidentialism over a delegative strategy—which according to O'Donnell (1994) typically results in the head of state moving from omnipotence to impotence once the honeymoon with public opinion comes to an end, making the presidents highly vulnerable to swings in society's mood—and the crafting of ad hoc legislative majorities. It is yet to be seen whether Milei will take stock of the recent experience and try to craft a more stable base of legislative support or wait for the October 2025 mid-term elections where half of the Chamber of Deputies and one-third of the Senate seats will be renewed and his share of legislative seats may increase. While the first alternative seems more advantageous, Milei looks more inclined to follow the second path outlined above, which fits better with his political communication strategy of attacking the ""caste."" This second alternative is not risk-free; as mentioned before, Milei has the support of fewer than one-third of the seats in both chambers of Congress, which means that if opposition parties join forces, they could override a presidential veto, abrogate DNUs or delegated decrees, or in the worst-case scenario, initiate an impeachment procedure, an unlikely scenario at this moment. The first semester of the Milei administration poses questions about governability, the sustainability of the administration's economic policy, and social tolerance to adjustment. Furthermore, Milei's leadership strategy, his political discourse and ideology, and his allegiance with far-right politicians from other countries put in the spotlight the discussion about whether Argentina's democracy is at risk. One of the most salient paradoxes of this first semester lies in the fact that despite the economic hardship resulting from the administration's initial economic measures to curb Argentina's longstanding macroeconomic imbalances, Milei retains a significant level of popular support. Social tolerance to economic adjustment has been higher than ex ante expectations. The acceleration in inflation resulting from the initial 50% currency devaluation and the adjustment in regulated prices deepened the decline in real wages that preceded the Milei administration (La Nación, 2024). Inflation has slowed since the 25.5% peak in December 2023, reaching in May a 4.2% monthly rate, the lowest monthly print since January 2022. This slowdown in price increases has come hand in hand with an acute recession. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to decline by 3.5% in 2024 (Buenos Aires Times, 2024). There are no official poverty indicators, but according to the Universidad Di Tella's Poverty Nowcast, the population living below the poverty line had increased from 45.2% in December 2023 to 48.7% in April–May 2024 (Universidad Di Tella, 2024). Yet, despite the current economic hardship, Milei's approval ratings are still high, taking into stock the economic situation. Figure 1 based on the government confidence index released monthly by Di Tella University (2024) shows that at the moment of writing this article, confidence in the government remained close to 50%. The discredit of the political establishment, particularly of Peronism, and positive expectations about the economy seem to lie behind the higher-than-expected tolerance of economic hardship. Milei's political communication strategy, which since day one stressed that harsh economic measures would be necessary to avoid a further worsening of the economic situation, has probably contributed to the greater than anticipated social patience. Despite the administration's internal disputes and frequent episodes of bureaucratic mismanagement, governability has been less of an issue than what may have been anticipated in December 2023. At the time of writing, Milei achieved his first victory in the legislative arena, with the Senate's approval of the resubmitted version of the omnibus bill and the fiscal package. Governability and the prospects of social unrest stood as key challenges for Milei. Even if these 6 months were free of episodes of social conflict—labor unions have already staged two general strikes against the government's policy while grassroots social movements have held several demonstrations against the Milei administration—these episodes have been staged by organizations tied to Peronism and have not included Milei's constituency.3 As for governability, despite his legislative weakness, Milei benefitted from two legacies of Massa's tenure in the Ministry of Economy. The scrapping of the income tax promoted by Massa and approved by Congress in September 2023 resulted in a loss of revenues for provincial administrations, some of which have a critical dependence on ""co-participación,"" Argentina's federal revenue sharing regime. At the same time, Congress' failure to pass the 2024 Budget Act before the November runoff endowed Milei with another powerful bargaining chip vis-à-vis provincial administration. In the absence of a budget act, the federal government can manage expenditures with a greater discretion. One of the administration's first decisions was to freeze nonautomatic transfers to provincial governments (Ámbito Financiero, 2024).4 To a certain extent, the financial choking of provincial administrations has partially offset Milei's weak legislative standing, giving him leverage to negotiate with governors. It is too early to assess whether Milei will succeed in stabilizing the economy and restoring economic growth. Financial markets and the IMF have welcomed Milei's economic policy, particularly his stress on curbing Argentina's fiscal deficit. Still, the IMF has repeatedly stressed the need to protect vulnerable populations and to enhance the social and political consensus behind the administration's economic policy (Clarín, 2024; FMI, 2024). Certain lessons from the stabilization and structural reform plans of the 1980s and 1990s should not be overlooked. In general, Milei's political approach evokes the stylized facts described by O'Donnell (1994)—a popular head of state and a group of technocrats, insulated from societal pressures, administer the bitter pill of adjustment. O'Donnell expected this approach to fail because of poor policy design that ultimately led the head of state from omnipotence to impotence when his approval ratings declined. Second, evidence from the 1980s and 1990s provides some insightful lessons, (1) incoming administrations are more inclined to tackle macroeconomic imbalances and launch stabilization plans; (2) outsiders have incentives to engage in fiscal adjustment and state downsizing as they deprive their political rivals of economic resources (Geddes, 1996); and (3) a highly committed group of state technocrats with sound credentials is necessary but not sufficient for the success of stabilization and reform initiatives. The literature on economic reforms points out having legislative majorities as part of the requirements for success (Torre, 1998). A final point lies in the prospects for Argentina's democracy. Milei's victory logically raised a concern on this matter. As discussed above, populism has often been the bridge between a weakened democracy and the emergence of competitive authoritarianism (Levitsky & Loxton, 2013). Milei's leadership style and ideas are certainly not encouraging. His adherence to liberalism is limited to the realm of economics. Before and after becoming Argentina's president, Milei has shown little tolerance of criticism and has referred to opposition leaders and journalists in harsh terms. Ideological polarization and radicalization are not encouraging features. Still, there are certain elements that provide a safety net for Argentina's democracy. Unlike other Latin American countries were the armed forces have either become a key arbiter in political crises or have amassed significant political power, the Argentine military is a weak political actor, one with little interest in getting involved in political affairs. Second, Milei does not control the judiciary branch and certainly not the Supreme Court of Justice, which is the ultimate arbiter when it comes to the constitutional validity of government actions. Finally, from a legislative standpoint, hegemonic or potentially dominant heads of state rather than weak presidents have typically been a major threat to democracy in Latin America (Pérez Liñan, 2018). In the near term, governability rather than democracy is much more likely to be at stake in Argentina, but the picture is certainly not a rosy one. Milei's arrival to power is the consequence of severe crises in Argentina's party system, which has certainly become less institutionalized. The election of a populist leader is hardly a solution for party-system weakness. In this vein, Milei's election was certainly an earthquake to Argentine political elites who are still in a state of shock. If Milei succeeds in solving Argentina's longstanding economic problems, a deep reconfiguration of the party system should take place. Meanwhile, his failure would not restore the old system and could in fact worsen Argentina's crisis of representation, further deteriorating democratic quality.

Financial market spillovers and investor attention to the Russia-Ukraine war,"This study examines the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on global commodity and financial markets by analysing the volatility and return spillovers of 26 assets across six different markets.We find significant increases in volatility spillovers after the invasion although increases in return spillovers were milder.Stock and currency markets were the leading spillover transmitters and receivers.Investor attention to the conflict played a large role in driving market spillovers, particularly in extreme quantiles.Meanwhile, uncertain market conditions seem to provide significant feedback to investor attention, resulting in amplified market risk.Our findings highlight the substantial effect of the Russia-Ukraine war on global market spillovers and the role of investor attention in shaping these dynamics.",2024-08-17,
Volatility Spillovers among the Major Commodities: A Review,"The integration of commodities into stock exchanges marked a pivotal moment in the analysis of price dynamics. Commodities are essential for both daily sustenance and industrial processes and are separated into hard commodities, like metals, and soft commodities, such as agricultural produce. This paper provides a review of the relevant literature concerning the implications of commodity price volatility on commercial and financial landscapes, recognizing its profound impact on global economies. Drawing from Google Scholar and Science Direct, we analyze trends in academic publications until 2022, particularly focusing on the interplay between volatility spillover and ten different commodities, providing insights into the evolution of research paradigms over time. In a nutshell, the literature suggests that relationships between hard commodities are stronger since, in addition to being raw materials, they also serve as investment products. For the same reason, relationships between agricultural products appear to be relatively weaker.",2024-08-15,
The Impact of Geopolitical Conflict and Fed Rate Hikes on Asset Pricing,"In the current context of weak economic recovery, ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and consecutive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, global financial and commodity markets have experienced intensified turbulence. To investigate the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes on asset pricing, this study first analyzed the U.S. stock market, bond market, and commodity market based on data from the CEIC database. From the comprehensive stock and year-on-year data after each round of interest rate hikes, it is evident that both the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes have had a significant negative impact on investors' financial assets. Additionally, due to the continuous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, funds from the stock market have gradually shifted to the bond market. Furthermore, after analyzing the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes on the U.S. stock market, bond market, and commodity market, the study further explored the influence of these factors on asset pricing using the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model. Finally, the study provided an outlook on future market trends.",2024-08-14,
The Impact of Geopolitical Conflicts on the Volatility of the International Financial Markets,"This paper aims to explore the specific impact of geopolitical conflicts on the international financial market. By analyzing the volatility of financial markets, investor sentiment, commodity prices, and the performance of various assets, the short-term and long-term financial impacts of conflict are revealed. Studies show that geopolitical conflicts have a significant impact on global markets, especially in energy and commodity markets, with different volatility effects on different regions and asset classes.",2024-08-14,
"Unveiling the terrain of non-bank Islamic personal financing: current practices, challenges, and future prospects","Purpose This study aims to investigate the current practices among selected non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in Malaysia in offering Islamic personal financing and the multiple challenges faced by them. Design/methodology/approach The qualitative research methodology was used, and primary data was collected using semi-structured interviews with 10 respondents consisting of NBFIs’ representatives and Shariah advisors. Findings Most Islamic personal financing practice is based on tawarruq. Among the major challenges faced by NBFIs are the absence of a comprehensive legal framework, Shariah non-compliance risks, cost, human resources and risk management. Recommendations include establishing a proper legal framework and Shariah governance. The study also recommends centralising at the regulatory level aspects such as training, commodity murabahah system and the department performing the Shariah advisory and control functions. Research limitations/implications Online interviews were conducted during the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with a limited number of respondents due to people’s hesitancy to participate during the pandemic. Practical implications The findings will guide regulators and industry players concerning the challenges that must be addressed and the recommendations that can be considered in ensuring complete adherence to Shariah principles for the offering of personal financing. Eventually, Muslim society in need of cash will benefit from the broader choice of Shariah-compliant personal financing. Social implications The research highlights the weaknesses of self-regulation in guaranteeing Shariah compliance and the need for regulatory intervention. Originality/value This is a pioneering empirical study that investigated the offering of Islamic personal financing among NBFIs in Malaysia, the challenges and the way forward.",2024-08-14,
Pajak Iklan Online,"This paper sheds new light on the question of how to build a tax model for online advertising and digital companies. Policy measures to tax transnational companies, including digital companies, should be based not only on the question of where and how much value is generated, but also on the question of who generates how much value. The legal definition of ‘digital permanent enterprise’ used in the context of online company taxation should be built on the understanding that only human labor creates the economic value of commodities. To counter the dominance of non-profit monopoly platforms on the Internet, the creation of public Internet services is a viable policy option. Introducing an online advertising tax is an ideal financial foundation to support the creation of public service Internet platforms and civil society Internet platforms.",2024-08-14,
Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning Algorithms Based on Technical Indicators,"Accurately forecasting stock prices helps investors decide when and where to invest. However, the dynamic, non-linear, complex and chaotic nature of the stock market makes price forecasting difficult. Market movements are influenced by many macroeconomic factors such as political events, corporate policies, economic conditions, commodity prices and bank interest rates. In addition, advances in technology and communication systems allow these events to be processed quickly, causing stock prices to fluctuate rapidly. Banks, financial institutions and large investors are therefore forced to act quickly, and the complexity of the market makes accurate forecasting even more difficult. Therefore, new and effective methods must be developed for accurate stock price predictions. In this study, technical indicators were utilized to reduce the noise in raw data, obtain meaningful results, and enhance prediction accuracy. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models demonstrate significant efficiency in analyzing financial time series data. The most appropriate parameters for predictions made with ANN were selected using the correlation coefficient method. The objective was to predict stock prices using technical indicators obtained from websites such as Yahoo Finance. Following the data preprocessing process, various methods were applied, including Single Layer Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), 3-Layer LSTM, 3-Layer Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM). This model aimed not only to find realistic price estimates but also to reduce the features that influence stock price estimates through technical indicators. The results indicate that the Single Layer LSTM method provides more realistic estimates than other deep learning (DL) techniques.",2024-08-13,
Combination Forecast of Soybean Futures Data of Dalian Commodity Exchange based on Entropy Weight Method,"As financial markets continue to develop, the need for accurate predictions in the futures market is growing. This paper takes the soybean futures of Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) as the research object, and uses the induced ordered weighted average (IOWA) operator combined with time series analysis and machine learning methods to construct a combined forecast model. First, multiple single prediction models are established through preprocessing and feature extraction of historical data. Secondly, the IOWA operator is used to integrate the results of each single prediction model to optimize the prediction performance. Experimental results show that compared with traditional prediction methods, the combined prediction model proposed in this paper has significant advantages in prediction accuracy and stability. In addition, this model can effectively capture market dynamics and provide investors with more reliable decision-making support. This article not only enriches the theoretical research on futures market forecasting, but also provides new perspectives and tools for practical operations.",2024-08-12,
Large Investment Model,"Traditional quantitative investment research is encountering diminishing returns alongside rising labor and time costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel research paradigm designed to enhance both performance and efficiency at scale. LIM employs end-to-end learning and universal modeling to create an upstream foundation model capable of autonomously learning comprehensive signal patterns from diverse financial data spanning multiple exchanges, instruments, and frequencies. These ""global patterns"" are subsequently transferred to downstream strategy modeling, optimizing performance for specific tasks. We detail the system architecture design of LIM, address the technical challenges inherent in this approach, and outline potential directions for future research. The advantages of LIM are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on cross-instrument prediction for commodity futures trading, leveraging insights from stock markets.",2024-08-12,
The influential impacts of international dynamic spillovers in forming investor preferences: a quantile-VAR and GDCC-GARCH perspective,"This study investigates whether representative sectoral stock indices, gold, oil, Bitcoin, and wheat can mitigate risk and improve portfolio performance during normal times versus crises. The cutting-edge Quantile Vector Autoregressive model and the Generalized Dynamic Conditional Correlations (Generalized-DCC) framework are adopted covering from 9 January 2017 until 30 August 2022. Econometric findings by the Q-VAR reveal that oil presents the strongest connection with commodities and stock indices and that Bitcoin and wheat despite their significant linkages with financial markets fail to act as safe havens. Moreover, GDCC-GARCH indicates that the returns of sectoral indices are weakly related but display powerful volatility co-movements. Gold serves efficiently as a hedger and oil follows and both act as better shelters during crises. Nevertheless, Bitcoin partly abides by conventional markets in stressed periods. Notably, wheat reliably works as a hedger overall but does not become a safe haven during crises.",2024-08-11,
"How do commodity futures respond to Ukraine–Russia, Taiwan Strait and Hamas–Israel crises? – An analysis using event study approach","Purpose The purpose of this study investigates the short-term market reaction of three commodity futures indices for four recent events of high geopolitical risk: the Ukraine–Russia war, the Taiwan Strait crisis and the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel. Design/methodology/approach The author examines three commodity futures indices at and around the beginning of four recent events of high geopolitical risk using an event study methodology. Findings The results show a positive abnormal return for the commodity futures indices for three of the four recent events considered in the analysis. The exception in terms of abnormal returns observed is the visit of US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan on August 2, 2022, which resulted in statistically significant negative abnormal returns in the commodity futures around the visit. The other three geopolitical events, by causing an increase of uncertainty level and supply-side constraints, led to a rise in the price of most commodity futures. This allowed commodity-exporting countries to achieve positive and statistically significant abnormal returns. Policy implications of our findings are discussed. Originality/value The effect of high geopolitical risk events on commodity futures indices has been relatively little examined in the financial theory. This study intends to fill this gap in the literature.",2024-08-09,
"Panama, Belize, and Guatemala","Chapter 2 examines illicit trade practices used by smugglers in Central America. Focusing primarily on illicit trades in drugs, cigarettes, and arms, this chapter identifies current trends in illicit activities and analyzes key enabling factors behind their expansion. It also explores different types of illicit trade beneficiaries, including legitimate companies supporting the trafficking of various illicit commodities through Central America. The study of the enabling environment for illicit trades in Panama, Belize, and Guatemala focuses on free trade zones, financial and money-laundering infrastructure, and corruption. Drawing on estimates based on the United Nations Comtrade database and the Panjiva Intelligence, this chapter provides evidence that free trade zones in Central America, particularly the Colón Free Zone in Panama and the Corozal Free Zone in Belize, are the main hotspots of all types of smuggling. Their major vulnerabilities include lax operational rules, limited transparency, and insufficient due diligence, as well as a lack of proper technology to detect illicit merchandise. The chapter also argues that corruption and the collusion between smugglers and law enforcement in Central American countries are the most important factors behind their failures to combat illicit trade. The chapter concludes with a summary of national anti-illicit trade efforts in Panama, Belize, and Guatemala, followed by policy recommendations for disrupting illicit activities in these hubs.",2024-08-09,
Future Contracts and Delayed Contracts,The contracts which are used by companies and investors to be careful of the risk or speculation of business are called future contracts &amp; delayed contracts. Future &amp; delayed contracts are considered as a good instance of etymological belongings that extract their values from the underlying belongings. A future contract is a unified legitimate deal to buy or sell something at a predetermined price and at a specific time in the future. The traded belonging is mostly a commodity or financial tool. The price which is pre-determined earlier and at which both parties are agreed upon (i.e. to buy and sell the belonging) is known as the delayed price. The specific time in the future is known as the delivery date which means when delivery and payment occur. The contracts which are negotiated on futures exchanges act as a market between buyers and sellers. The person who buys the contract is known as the holder of a long position and the person who sells the contract is known as the holder of the short position. A futures contract for stocks is a cash-settled future contract on the value of a particular stock market index. Future contracts for stocks are defined as one of the high-risk trading tools in the market. Future contracts for Stock market indicator are also used as indicators to determine market sentiment.,2024-08-09,
Monetary dissent and the erasure of state power in American history,"Modern Money Theory (MMT) is part of a generations-old dissenting tradition that has challenged conventional, ""commodity-exchange"" models of finance by documenting money's origins in credit and its anchor in state power. Defenders of the conventional wisdom have generally responded to these challenges—including that posed by MMT scholars—by ignoring or dismissing the substance of this critique: by insisting upon a sharp distinction between ""money"" and ""credit"" and, in doing so, masking a unique power of money-issuing authorities. After briefly introducing the trans-Atlantic history of these political and intellectual contests, this chapter turns to the modern United States and the battles over financial reform and economic theory unleashed by the Great Depression and New Deal experimentation. It demonstrates how the reassertion of economic orthodoxy during this era proved consequential to sustaining monetary myths that MMT scholars and other dissenting voices continue to challenge.",2024-08-09,
Comparing the hedge and safe haven properties of individual commodities for China and United States equity sectors,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize the safe haven benefits of 13 individual commodities for the USA and Chinese equity sectors during the financial turmoil period. Therefore, sectoral investors in the USA and China could invest in those specific commodities that provide stable returns during the health crisis and financial turmoil periods. Design/methodology/approach The daily data spans from February 1, 2015, to July 28, 2022. The present study applies several different approaches to analyzing the data set. The author apply the cross-quantilogram (C.Q) methodology to capture the lead-lag bivariate quantile interdependence between two stationary time series variables during the bearish, bullish and normal periods. Then the study used the hedging effectiveness (HE) and conditional diversification benefits (CDB) approaches to capture the hedging and diversification benefits of commodity classes and individual commodities. Findings The noteworthy findings of the quantilogram methodology reveal that livestock and agriculture commodities serve as better refuges as compared to the precious metals and energy index in both countries. On average, precious metals failed to serve as safe haven investments for the USA and Chinese equity market sectors. All energy commodities except soybean oil had strong comovements with China and the US equity sectors during bearish, bullish and normal periods. Lean hogs, fiddler cattle and live cattle are perfect hedging assets for both countries due to the presence of blue color at normal and bullish periods in all C.Q heat-maps. The HE table depicts that commodity indices and individual commodities failed to serve as hedging assets for the Chinese equity sectors. But commodities are semistrong hedging assets for the US equity sectors and the S&amp;P 500 due to the average HE values being 0.7 and above. The CDB values depict that precious metals provide diversification benefits in both equity markets. Practical implications The present study results have important implications for equity sector investors of the USA and China in suggesting particular commodity during the financial turmoil period. During the bearish market condition, risk averse equity sector investors can invest in livestock commodities and agriculture commodities, due to their relatively stable returns. In addition, policymakers can use the analysis insights to formulate policy tools and monitoring mechanisms, effectively mitigating the unfavorable effects arising from asymmetric dependence between commodities and equity sectors during the upper tail, middle and lower tail. Policymakers can suggest equity investors to invest in which commodity during extreme conditions. Originality/value The current study has the following points of originality. First, to the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the individual commodities’ roles as safe havens taken from all four major commodity classes. More importantly, it is also noticeable that the safe haven abilities of commodities are usually tested for the stock market, but the equity sectors are ignored. Therefore, the present study used both stock market and sectoral indices data.",2024-08-08,
"IMPACT OF FARMERS’ INVOLVEMENT IN AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAIN ON LIVELIHOODS, A CASE OF MAIZE SEED MULTIPLICATION PROGRAMME IN BARINGO SOUTH SUB-COUNTY, KENYA.","Agricultural value chains must establish mutually beneficial and sustainable relationships with farmers and farmer groups for the sole purpose of ensuring commodity supply and farmers' livelihoods are more resilient. Small-scale farmers, comprising the majority of the world's farming population are important actors in the agricultural value chains. A study was done to determine whether farmer involvement in maize seed multiplication programme impacted on their livelihoods in Baringo South, Kenya. The study focused on whether farmers' ability to repay credit, whether they make savings from maize seed multiplication programme, the sustainability of such savings and how the savings translate to consistency in meeting family basic needs. Results indicated that, sustainability of farmer savings from the maize seed programme was statistically significant in relation to farmers' livelihoods; where, with a unit increase in sustainability of savings, the odds of a farmer inability to consistently provide for all his family basic needs decreased by 1.767. Only 61.8% of farmers reported to be making some income savings in the maize seed multiplication programme while 22.1% reported being unable to make any savings. Therefore, to enable farmers realize better productivity from maize seed multiplication programme and adequately sustain their family livelihoods, the study recommends; building farmer capacity on financial management and providing environment conducive for farmers so as to minimize losses and safeguard their hard-earned income.",2024-08-07,
The Impact of COVID-19 on Commodity and S&amp;P 500 Sector Return Volatility,"We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on commodity return volatility. We find that the impact of COVID-19 on return volatility is different across different markets. Unlike S&amp;P 500 sector indices, commodity return volatility is less sensitive to the impact of COVID-19. The impact of vaccination programs on return volatility is weak for both commodity and financial markets. We employ Fama-French 3 Factor Model and APARCH (1,1) for return volatility estimation. The variation in COVID-19’s impact across different markets has an important implication for return volatility hedging.",2024-08-07,
The Mutual Generation of Errors of Optimism and Errors of Pessimism,"§ 1. Hitherto we have considered errors of optimism and pessimism as simple, self-contained and independent. They are not, however, in fact of this character. On the contrary, errors of either sort, in whatever way they may have come about, have the characteristic of generating, after a while, errors of the opposite sort. The process is not difficult to understand. The activity which is developed in industry under the influence of an error of optimism finally materialises in the form of commodities seeking a market. So long as these are in process of being created —as we may say, throughout their period of gestation— exceptional activity continues. Some of them, of course, are completed sooner than others. Even for the same sort of thing the period of gestation is not the same when factories are fully occupied as when they are slack: and for different sorts of things it varies greatly. A boom involves, as it were, the sowing of a great number of different kinds of seed, the crops from which are scattered over a considerable range of time. Some of the seed will spring up and flower immediately; some in one year, some in two, some in three, some perhaps in ten. The period of gestation for ordinary consumable goods, such as cotton cloth, is very short. Construction goods in general take a good deal longer to make. Mr. Hull states that it takes a year to build an iron furnace. M. Aftalion suggests that the gap between ordering and completion is, for the rolling stock of railways some one and a half years, for locomotives some three years, and for shipping some two years. Houses, according to their size, may take from one to three years to build. Steam-engines for industrial works in Prance may take one, two or three years. The period of gestation of a coffee plantation is some five years. That of a coal mine is probably, in present conditions, even longer. The above are not designed to be more than illustrations. The essential fact is that the period of gestation varies greatly for different things, and is especially likely to be long for elaborate constructional instruments. We cannot, therefore, say generally that the period will always be of such and such a definite length. But we can say that, for all things, there is some period of gestation, the conclusion of which brings forecast to the test of fact. When this test has been applied to a fair number of things and found wanting for a fair number, confidence is shaken. The fact that errors of optimism have been made and prospective profits exaggerated is discovered and recognised widely. By the fact of discovery on a large scale the tendency to errors of optimism is necessarily destroyed. As a consequence the flow of business activity is checked. The check does not, indeed, operate instantaneously, because business men who find themselves in difficulties are tempted to extend their borrowings and make a desperate throw to restore their fortunes. After a little while, however, those people who have made and acted upon errors of optimism have to confess them—at least to themselves,—to sell a mass of products at a lower real price than they had anticipated, and to pocket the consequent loss. This leaves them in no mood for any further errors of optimism. Nor is this all. Partly in consequence of the financial interdependence of different businesses discussed in Chapter VI., they are apt to fall into a strong reaction. The ill-fate that has occurred to the direct victims of optimistic error strikes indirectly at a great number of other people. Traders who have done bad business, being impoverished, endeavour to draw in their debts from other houses directly associated with them. This action on their part causes the other houses in turn to adopt a like policy. Hence a fairly general liquidation of bad business sets in. ""Once begun, the process of liquidation extends rapidly, partly because most enterprises, which are called upon to settle their maturing obligations, in turn put similar pressure upon their own debtors, and partly because, despite all efforts to keep secret what is going forward, news presently leaks out and other creditors take alarm."" 1 This movement inevitably reacts upon business confidence. Under its influence the dying error of optimism gives birth to an error of pessimism. This new error is born, not an infant, but a giant. For an industrial boom has necessarily been a period of strong emotional excitement, and an excited man passes from one form of excitement to another more readily than he passes to quiescence. The error of pessimism thus established implies an unduly depressed view in all industries of the prospective demand of other industries for their products. Therefore in all of them but little activity is expended, and dullness supervenes. After an interval, equal, as before, to the period of gestation of the principal instrumental goods plus the time necessary for their products to get to market, the error of undue pessimism, like the previous error of undue optimism, is discovered. Those who have ventured to order these things, or to make them in anticipation of orders, find themselves in receipt of good profits. Moreover, after a time the continued using up of dealers' stocks reduces them to a point below which no further reduction can be made, so that, henceforth, new orders must be given to cover the whole, and not merely a part, of the current purchases of consumers. In these circumstances certain of the bolder spirits in industry begin to make preparations for an enlarged output, or to venture upon some hitherto untried type of enterprise, for which scientific advance has opened up the way. 2 The pioneers, who thus undertake and expand enterprises, at once fill a social need and lay up treasure for themselves. Gradually, as no disaster happens to them, other less bold spirits follow their example; then others and yet others. Professor Sehumpeter well writes: ""Whenever in a given situation new things have been successfully done by some, others can, on the one hand, copy their behaviour in the same fine—whence prominence of one industry at the time—and, on the other hand, get the courage to do similar things in other lines, the spell being broken, and many details of the behaviour of the first leaders being applicable outside their own field of action. And, therefore, the first success draws other people in its wake."" 1 All these people are further encouraged by the fact, noted by Professor Mitchell, that, during the preceding period of depression, there has probably been an accumulation of ""technical improvements, of which new plants can take advantage, and, therefore, the greater becomes the inducement to invest in new equipment "". 2 Advance thus takes place all along the line. ""There is, of course, no formal agreement between the different trades to begin again to work full time, and so make a market for each other's wares. But the revival of industry comes about through the gradual and often simultaneous growth of confidence among various trades."" 3 The first-comers make an addition to industrial energy that is really needed to correct the error that has hitherto prevailed. Perhaps those who come in and expand their business directly after the beginnings of revival are also in this class. The first year or two, say, is taken up with a wholly justified expansion. But, after the first year or two, further expansion represents, not a correction of the past error, but the creation of a new one, and, thereafter, any further expansion represents a growth of unjustified optimism. The turn of the tide from ebb to flow is a slow and gradual process. Cautiously and hesitatingly the first steps on the return journey towards the correct route are taken; some time elapses before that route is reached; when it is reached it is passed, and a new false track on the opposite side is entered upon, down which industry runs at an accelerating pace, until once more the presence of an error of optimism is revealed and, on revelation, destroyed. An error of pessimism is then again generated in the way we have described, and presently, when it in turn has died, a new wave of optimism begins to gather on the same pattern as before.",2024-08-06,

Оцениваются необходимые условия для создания финансовой архитектуры: политическая воля, правовые реформы, инфраструктура. Отмечается потенциал новой системы для формирования многополярного миропорядка и изменения глобального баланса экономических сил. The article examines the prospect of BRICS countries creating an independent financial architecture as an alternative to the existing US dollar-centric system. The reasons and goals for forming a sovereign financial model are analyzed, including reducing dependence on the US dollar, fair distribution of influence on global economic processes, and stimulating trade and investment among the members of the association. The implemented and planned projects within BRICS are considered: payment system, common cryptocurrency, commodity exchanges. The necessary conditions for creating a financial architecture are evaluated: political will, legal reforms, and infrastructure. The potential of the new system for shaping a multipolar world order and shifting the global balance of economic power is noted.",2024-08-06,
"Hedge Fund Portfolio Construction Using PolyModel Theory and
  iTransformer","When constructing portfolios, a key problem is that a lot of financial time series data are sparse, making it challenging to apply machine learning methods. Polymodel theory can solve this issue and demonstrate superiority in portfolio construction from various aspects. To implement the PolyModel theory for constructing a hedge fund portfolio, we begin by identifying an asset pool, utilizing over 10,000 hedge funds for the past 29 years' data. PolyModel theory also involves choosing a wide-ranging set of risk factors, which includes various financial indices, currencies, and commodity prices. This comprehensive selection mirrors the complexities of the real-world environment. Leveraging on the PolyModel theory, we create quantitative measures such as Long-term Alpha, Long-term Ratio, and SVaR. We also use more classical measures like the Sharpe ratio or Morningstar's MRAR. To enhance the performance of the constructed portfolio, we also employ the latest deep learning techniques (iTransformer) to capture the upward trend, while efficiently controlling the downside, using all the features. The iTransformer model is specifically designed to address the challenges in high-dimensional time series forecasting and could largely improve our strategies. More precisely, our strategies achieve better Sharpe ratio and annualized return. The above process enables us to create multiple portfolio strategies aiming for high returns and low risks when compared to various benchmarks.",2024-08-06,
The politics of housing: policy reform,"Especially in modern high-income countries, housing provision involves complex and interconnected systems in which numerous factors affect both demand and supply. Certain inherent features of housing as a product, as well as the increasingly fragmented and intellectually eroded state of housing policy governance, also contribute to making this a particularly challenging policy area when it comes to reform. Nevertheless, growing concerns around declining housing affordability in the post-Global Financial Crisis era have brought to the fore three distinct, albeit potentially somewhat overlapping, housing reform discourses. However, only one of these—the 'land and finance' narrative—is informed by a full recognition of the special qualities of housing and land as economic commodities. Some associated policy proposals may be compatible with neoliberal governance, but since others challenge fundamental beliefs on the sanctity of private property and neoliberal pre-conceptions on the proper role of government, this discourse pushes at the boundaries of what could be termed reform. While our review only goes to highlight inherent obstacles in realizing such change, we also discuss pre-conditions for necessary structural reform and highlight the argument that continuing inaction comes at a mounting cost.",2024-08-06,
Mapping sustainable investing: Exploring ambiguities and consistencies among sustainable indices,"Sustainable investing is perceived as a confusing black-box by many researchers, practitioners, and investors. Terminology, metrics, approaches, disclosure standards are quickly evolving, while the empirical evidence provides a growing number of mixed results. In this paper, we examine the composition, performance, and the risk-return profile of reference sustainable indices for the asset management industry, distinguishing between ethical and socially-responsible, faith-based, ESG and climate ones. Our findings reveal consistent investment trends across various sustainable indices, impacting their overall performance. Specifically, our analysis highlights a prevalent inclination towards large and growth-oriented companies, as well as a persistent focus on technology, financials, and commodity sectors. These results provide valuable insights for investors, asset managers, and index providers regarding the potential misalignment between an investment vehicle's labeling and its actual composition, and the implications this discrepancy might have on investors' expectations.",2024-08-05,
Comparative Study for the Successful Implementation of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Solution in Developed and Developing Countries,"Abstract Nigeria in the recent past has faced dual-fuel (petrol and diesel) shortages. The non-functional or sub-functional refineries have made the availability of these products even more scarce and expensive for the average Nigerian. The key source for the petroleum commodities identified has been importation, which has further depleted the much-desired forex required by the nation. Inversely, Nigeria has abundant Natural Gas Reserves estimated at 209 trillion cubic feet (NUPRC, 2023). A large chunk of her natural gas reserves is produced and exported leaving the domestic market with a meager portion for domestic utilisation for her rising population with a relatively low impact on national development. The use of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as a transport fuel therefore provides a two-fold opportunity to alleviate petroleum import dependency and reduce the economic pressure, especially for foreign exchange and subsidy expenditure. There is the current clamour for the implementation of Compressed Natural Gas usage in the country, but this if not well directed, could become a monumental failure and further exacerbate the economic situation of the country. There is a need for a well-guided and intentional implementation of the usage of CNG to ensure that its populace benefits from this natural and abundant resource. The study employed a qualitative inquiry approach, using a comparative study of secondary data from academic literature, published reports, online sources, and grey literature. The study aimed to identify the predominant themes from other climes by adapting compressed natural gas development initiatives from nine different countries with relevance to Nigeria. The writer posits that well- specified strategic objective, adequate legal framework and backing, learning and adaptation from previous implementations elsewhere in the world, appropriate and well-defined assignment of responsibilities to key players, adequate financial incentives, holistic and appropriate natural gas pricing, and natural gas vehicle (NGV) infrastructure development would be required to successfully implement compressed natural gas in Nigeria The study therefore concluded that a key factor for NGV market development in Nigeria is a well-coordinated implementation approach with greater government involvement required in setting strategic goals, developing the legal and regulatory frameworks, private sector partnership for infrastructural development, as well as assigning responsibilities to specific agencies. The short-term low-cost policy is encouraged and offering limited support for refueling and retrofitting facilities",2024-08-05,
IFCI-SA: International financial conditions index for South American economies,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, triggered a wave of risk aversion in the global financial markets. In contrast to previous events, South American emerging economies experienced limited impact to this more restrictive global financial environment. To measure the financial conditions of these economies over time, we propose an International Financial Conditions Index for South American economies (IFCI-SA), built from a parametric factor model. This index includes standard variables provided by the literature, along with sovereign debt risk premia and the most relevant commodity prices for the region. We use our model and index to: (i) discuss South American financial conditions from 2007 to 2024; (ii) explain the impact of a particular global event like the Russo-Ukrainian war; (iii) decompose risk premia movements into global and domestic shocks; and (iv) test its forecasting capabilities.",2024-08-03,
Emission trading in a high dimensional context: to what extent are carbon markets integrated with the broader system?,"Abstract The EU ETS represents the cornerstone of the EU climate policy framework. While most of the studies focus on the determinants of carbon price, this work will provide further insights into the influence of European Emission Allowance (EUA) prices on carbon dioxide trends and variables of the economic-financial-climate-environmental system considering a large set of time series. Results highlighted how CO 2 appears to be more influenced by commodity prices, climate variables, and past industrial performances. Furthermore, a shock in carbon prices could potentially exert significant turbulence on the carbon dioxide series, fading in intensity as time goes by. Overall, there appears to be a net positive effect on the influence of carbon prices on the system. However, robustness checks identified how the impact of carbon price on CO 2 and other variables of the model is still weak. This work sheds light on the EU ETS's influence on a set of multidimensional variables. Still, overlapping national policies appear to interfere with the EU ETS effectiveness in the EU.",2024-08-02,
ANALYSIS OF THE DEPENDENCIES COMMODITY PRICES AND STOCK MARKET INDEXES USING COPULA,"Indonesia is rich in natural resources and occupies an important position in the global raw materials market. The country's rich resources such as oil, coal, nickel, and crude palm oil (CPO) have a significant impact on the economic situation. As one of the world's leading producers and exporters of these raw materials, Indonesia's economic fate is closely linked to price fluctuations. This study uses the copula method to model the dependence between stock and commodity returns and calculates the dependence between commodity prices (oil, coal, nickel, CPO) and Indonesian stock market index (IHSG) The data used for this analysis was sourced from Bloomberg.com, covering the period from 29 September 2021 to 29 September 2023. This study investigates the dynamic dependencies between commodity price returns and the Indonesian stock market index. The results show that the correlations between oil prices and the Indonesian stock index, and between CPO prices and the stock index are generally weak. However, there are exceptions to stock index returns, such as their relatively high dependence on coal and nickel. This diverse research provides valuable insight into the complex interdependencies in Indonesia's financial landscape. Understanding dependence between commodity prices and stock indexes is of great value to investors and policymakers, as it is the basis for making informed decisions to navigate the complex global economy.",2024-08-02,
Logistics centres of the Moscow region,"Сегодняшний день – время серьезного логистического кризиса, в том числе и в отрасли овощеводства и картофелеводства. Растет число ограничений на экспорт или импорт овощной продукции и картофеля, продолжаются торговые войны между разными странами. Возникает необходимость искать новые рынки сбыта и новых партнеров, оптимизировать и перераспределять в соответствии с этим товарно-продуктовые потоки. Немалую актуальность эта проблема имеет для центральной части Европейской России и Московского региона как одного из ее логистических центров. Московская область относится к регионам с развитым овощеводством. Здесь расположены крупнейшие агрохолдинги. Для совершенствования логистической инфраструктуры Правительство РФ в марте 2020 года разработало проект Транспортной стратегии до 2035 года, результатом реализации которой должна стать общая оптимизация логистической структуры страны. В производящих картофель и овощи регионах необходимо организовывать комплексные логистические хабы, которые позволяли бы оптимальным образом, на основе системного подхода, направлять и распределять материальные, финансовые, энергетические потоки. Один из крупнейших агрологистических комплексов Московской области – «Селятино», расположенный в Наро-Фоминском городском округе и действующий с 2021 года. Это крупнейший канал поставок подмосковной продукции АПК на экспорт. Он также претендует на звание крупнейшего в стране российско-китайского сухого порта. В текущем году на станции Селятино российское АО «Славтранс-Сервис», АО «Национальная компания «Казахстан темир жолы» (КТЖ, «Казахстанские железные дороги») и китайская Xi'an Free Trade Port Construction &amp; Operation Co., Ltd. официально начали строить новый подмосковный транспортно-логистический центр CRK Terminal. В современных реалиях в Московском регионе и по всей России формируется сеть транспортно–логистических центров, ориентированная на новые направления товарных потоков. Today is a time of serious logistical crisis, including in the vegetable and potato growing industry. The number of restrictions on the export or import of vegetable products and potatoes is growing, and trade wars between different countries continue. There is a need to look for new sales markets and new partners, optimize and redistribute commodity and product flows in accordance with this. This problem is of considerable relevance for the central part of European Russia and the Moscow region as one of its logistics centers. The Moscow region belongs to the regions with developed vegetable growing. The largest agricultural holdings are located here. In order to improve the logistics infrastructure, the Government of the Russian Federation in March 2020 developed a draft Transport Strategy until 2035, the result of which should be the overall optimization of the country's logistics structure. In potato and vegetable-producing regions, it is necessary to organize complex logistics hubs that would optimally, based on a systematic approach, direct and distribute material, financial, and energy flows. One of the largest agrologistic complexes in the Moscow region is Selyatino, located in the Naro–Fominsk city district and operating since 2021. This is the largest export supply channel for agricultural products from the Moscow region. It also claims to be the country's largest Russian-Chinese dry port. This year, at the Selyatino station, the Russian JSC Slavtrans-Service, JSC National Company Kazakhstan Temir Zholy (KTZ, Kazakhstan Railways) and the Chinese Xi'an Free Trade Port Construction &amp; Operation Co., Ltd. Officially, the construction of a new CRK Terminal transport and logistics center near Moscow has begun. In modern realities, a network of transport and logistics centers is being formed in the Moscow region and throughout Russia, focused on new directions of goods flows.",2024-08-02,
Financial stress and realized volatility: The case of agricultural commodities,"Given recent debates about the financialization of commodity markets, we analyze the predictive power of financial stress for the realized volatility of agricultural commodity price returns. We estimate realized volatility from high-frequency intra-day data, where the sample period ranges from 2009 to 2020. We study the in-sample and out-of-sample predictability of realized volatility using variants of the popular heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model for realized volatility. We analyze the predictive value of financial stress by region of origin and by financial source, and we also control for various realized moments (leverage, realized skewness, realized kurtosis, realized jumps, realized upside tail risk, and realized downside tail risk). We find for several commodities evidence of in-sample predictive value of financial stress for realized volatility, consistent with the financialialization hypothesis. This in-sample evidence, however, does not necessarily extend to an out-of-sample forecasting environment.",2024-08-01,
Indonesia,"Indonesia's growth remains strong despite external headwinds. Inflation is firmly in the target range and the financial sector is resilient. The authorities have been pursuing an ambitious growth agenda to reach high-income status by 2045. This comprises public spending, institutional reforms, and Industrial Policy (IP). Risks are broadly balanced. Key downside risks include persistent commodity price volatility (e.g., from geopolitical shocks), an abrupt slowdown in Indonesia's key trading partners, or adverse spillovers from tighter-for-longer global financial conditions. On the domestic side, a weakening of long-standing sound macro-fiscal frameworks could hamper policy credibility. On the upside, stronger-than-anticipated growth in trading partners or faster disinflation in AEs could prop up growth while deep structural reforms would raise growth over the medium term.",2024-08-01,
Comment on “Recent Developments in Indian Central Banking: Flying through Turbulence but Aided by Some Tailwinds”,"My comments on Ray and Mohan (2025) are focused on three aspects. First, while India's recovery since COVID has been especially noteworthy in 2023–24, it has been a ""K-shaped"" recovery nevertheless. Depending on which part of India one talks about, it is either booming (urban and formal sector) or it still remains scarred from the pandemic (rural and informal sector). Since the pandemic, an operating profit-to-sales gap has opened up widely between large firms (+1.5%) versus small firms (−0.5%). While large manufacturing firms have been able to retain their size, small manufacturing firms have contracted by 14%. Small firms and establishments are important in India as they contribute to over 40% of overall labor in India. Separately, 40% of labor in India is also in agriculture. Both small firms and agriculture tend to have a greater presence in rural India. Hence, while wages in urban India have remained elevated far in excess of the inflation rate, rural wages even if increasing nominally have been outpaced by inflation for most of 2022. This fall in real rural wages has interacted with other shocks to weather and commodity prices to create a weak rural, informal, small-firm economy. Given these observations, the stability of consumer price inflation in India at 6% over the past 4 years, 2% above the mandated 4% target for the Monetary Policy Committee in India, must be viewed in light of the cumulative erosion of the purchasing power of those that have experienced negative real wage growth. In sum, it would be good for Ray and Mohan to touch upon the issue of real wage growth in India, its distribution, its likely effect on consumption, and what inflation and monetary policy has done or can do about it in the challenging years since COVID. Indeed, has monetary policy contributed to the K-shape of the recovery in the first place? Second, a range of initiatives has been undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) since 2017 to resolve the nonperforming assets (NPAs) of the Indian banking system, capitalizing on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). These have now come to fruition in that gross and net NPAs of scheduled commercial banks were down in September 2022 to 5% and 1.3%, respectively, from peaks of 11.2% and 6.1% in 2018. Nevertheless, there are critical views of the IBC that stem from the facts that: (i) debt in India continues to perform closer to equity, recovering only 39% for resolutions under the IBC, which makes recoveries for bank loans in India virtually half of the global average; (ii) the average time to resolution since the filing of a case has been 561 days, about twice what was originally envisaged; and (iii) a phenomenal 45% of the cases under the IBC get liquidated. The contrasting salubrious view of the IBC arises from the observations that: (i) as a result of the banking sector clean-up, capacity utilization of distressed sectors has improved and overall risen to close to 75% at present from a low 60% prior to 2017, when there was an over-supply of zombie firms in these sectors; and, (ii) fresh slippages into nonperforming loans has declined due to an important deterrence effect of the IBC, whereby the loss of control for business owners and individual promoters has led to a de-leveraging of the Indian corporate sector, with debt to GDP of the corporate sector having declined over a decade from 78% to 50%. Therefore, I agree with the authors that institutional reforms can play a crucial role in improving the effectiveness of monetary policy. Can this be substantiated further, for example, by looking at the pass-through of monetary policy via deposit and lending rates? Third, historically, India's micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have struggled to receive formal financing, with only 0.6 million out of 64 million receiving such credit. While the financial system has been creative via micro-finance to get some of the others access to credit, it has been estimated that there remains a formal financing gap of over $US 3.5trillion when it comes to MSME credit. However, the situation is changing on the ground on the back of ""India Stack"". This is an important structural reform of the Indian real economy and the financial sector. What are the exact implications of this digital plumbing of India and enabling of better credit access to MSMEs for inflation and growth? Some estimates that shed light on these implications would have added to the richness of Ray and Mohan (2025).",2024-08-01,
OPINION PAPER: OIL PALM AND ISLAMIC FINANCE AS THE TWO INTERCONNECTED INDUSTRIES,"This paper investigates the evolving dynamics of the oil palm industry and its intricate implications for Islamic finance, particularly in the context of Malaysia where both sectors hold significant economic importance.Given the pivotal role of oil palm as a key commodity in Islamic financial instruments, notably in tawarruq (commodity trading), understanding the interplay between these two industries is crucial for charting a strategic path forward for both.Building upon prior research that has explored the oil palm-Islamic finance nexus, this study delves deeper into the specific Malaysian context, where oil palm reigns as the most frequently utilised commodity by Islamic financial institutions.By analysing the latest developments, we aim to uncover not only the inherent risks but also the untapped potential that oil palm presents for the Islamic finance sector.Effectively managing the risks associated with oil palm production and trade, while simultaneously harnessing its potential benefits, can significantly enhance the growth trajectory of both the oil palm industry and the Islamic finance sector in Malaysia.This, in turn, could have far-reaching implications for the overall economic development of the country.The insights gleaned from this research will be invaluable for policymakers, financial institutions, and industry stakeholders alike, enabling them to make informed decisions that foster sustainable growth and resilience in these interconnected sectors.",2024-08-01,

Impact of Agriculture Products and Market Development Build up Nepalese Economy,"Agriculture has long been the backbone of Nepal’s economy, providing livelihoods for a significant portion of the population, particularly in rural areas. Agricultural products, especially staple crops like maize, paddy, wheat, and other food staples, play a central role in Nepal's socio-economic development. Strengthening agricultural markets is not only crucial for improving food security but also for fostering economic growth, reducing poverty, and promoting self-sufficiency. This Research examines the role of agricultural products and market strengthening in contributing to Nepal’s economic growth. Research efforts on the part of Agriculture commodity marketplaces promoting productive financial growth of Nepal, specifically examining main market place in Bagmati Province, including Banepa, Narayanghat, and Nuwakot. The findings highlight maize, paddy, and wheat as the main commodities grown in the region, which are in high demand due to their daily consumption and staple nature. The study also notes that the Terai region and Indian supply channels are critical to the local economy, with much of the supply coming from these areas. A key finding of the study is that approximately 60% of local agricultural production is available for only 2-3 months, indicating a potential gap in year-round self-sufficiency. To address this issue, the study recommends enhancing the promotion and management of local production, which would not only reduce dependency on external supply chains but also improve the overall economic stability of the region. Promoting self-sufficiency through better agricultural practices, infrastructure improvements, and effective policy interventions could help balance the supply-demand disparity, ensuring more consistent availability of key commodities.",2024-08-01,
Cross-border ripples: investigating stock market responses to Israel-Hamas conflict in trading partner nations using event study method,"Purpose The study will add to the current discourse on the Israel-Hamas conflict by examining the impact of the war on the stock markets of trading partners. Stock market returns inevitably rise as globalization keeps integrating financial markets and economies around the world. Thus, the impact of war is assessed across a range of indicators that are similar in some way, such as geographic location, political climate or economic standing. Thus, the goal of this study is to investigate how the Israel-Hamas war affects trading partner countries' stock performance. Design/methodology/approach Event study methodology is applied using Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI) as a benchmark index. The influence of the Israel-Hamas war on the world's major stock markets is evaluated using a market model. The study takes into account Israel and its 23 trading partners. To capture the locational asymmetry in the outcome, the countries are further categorized according to their geographic locations. The official declaration of war came on October 7, 2023, a non-trading day. Consequently, October 9, 2023, is designated as the event day in this study. The data was gathered between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, with an estimation period of 140 days taken into account to minimize bias. Findings Asymmetric response is shown among the nations due to their economic standing, geographic proximity and trading links with Israel. While Austria, Greece, Egypt, Palestine and Israel had the greatest negative effects, Argentina, Japan and Chile saw significant beneficial effects. The remaining nations had little effect. The market quickly adjusted itself, eliminating anomalous returns. Research limitations/implications Taking into account the topic's criticality, the current work has certain limits. The study has used the daily data to limit its reach to the stock market exclusively. In the future, academics can combine high-frequency stock market data with data from other macroeconomic variables, such as currency or different commodities markets, to further their research. Furthermore, a cross-national comparison of the impact in terms of direction and intensity regarding developing global groups such as I2U2, LEVANT, BRICS, MIKTA, SCO, NATO, SAARC and OECD can provide a more comprehensive understanding in this context. To gain insight into the durability and adaptation of financial systems over time, longitudinal studies could be conducted to monitor the long-term effects of geopolitical crises on the stock markets of trading partner countries. Practical implications By better managing investment portfolios and evaluating potential risks associated with trading partners involved in such conflicts, investors and businesses can lessen the impact of geopolitical tensions on stock market performance. These results contribute to our understanding of how geopolitical conflicts affect stock markets. Originality/value This research provides an extensive analysis of the global impact of Israel-Hamas tensions on stock market volatility by taking into account trading partners. This allows for the investigation of how various market structures and economic systems react to geopolitical turmoil. The present study is one of the first attempts to look into how disturbances in one region might affect continents to better understand the dynamics of global trade and economic interdependencies.",2024-07-31,
"The Impact of Macroeconomic Factors on the Volatility of Tin Commodity Futures Contract Prices: Empirical Study on Inflation, Interest Rates, and Forward Prices","This research explores the impact of macroeconomic factors on the volatility of tin commodity futures contract prices, with a focus on inflation, interest rates and forward prices. The volatility of tin futures prices is important to investment strategies and risk management. Understanding the influence of these macroeconomic variables helps in making better investment decisions. The independent variables analyzed include inflation (X1), interest rates (X2), and forward prices (X3). Inflation reflects general price increases that can increase production costs and affect commodity prices. Interest rates are borrowing costs that influence investment decisions through the cost of capital. Forward prices reflect market expectations of future commodity prices. The dependent variable is the volatility of the tin commodity futures contract price (Y). This research methodology uses linear regression to analyze historical data from the three macroeconomic variables. Data is collected from economic reports, financial market data, and government publications. Analysis is carried out to determine the influence of each variable on futures price volatility. The research results show that inflation and forward prices have a significant influence on the volatility of tin futures contract prices, while interest rates have no significant influence. Increased inflation leads to increases in production costs and prices of goods, increasing future price uncertainty and volatility. High forward prices reflect expectations of future increases in commodity prices, which also increases volatility.

An Exploration of the Impact of Digital Economy on Bulk Commodity Trade Models and Risk Management,"Bulk commodity circulation trade has stepped into an advanced stage, the traditional trade model can not adapt to the needs of high-quality development of enterprises. If enterprises want to achieve sustainable development, they must try every means to continuously innovate the trade model. Today, with the rapid development of information technology, digital economy has become a key element driving the evolution of global bulk commodity trade models, which are also undergoing profound changes. This paper synthesizes the relevant research on bulk commodity trade models and risk management through the method of literature review, on the basis of which the paper goes on to discuss how the rise and development of the digital economy affects domestic bulk commodity trade s and how emerging risks can be effectively and efficiently managed in this new economic environment. By combing and summarizing the literature, this paper argues that the digital economy improves transaction efficiency and price transparency, reduces costs, and at the same time makes the logistics chain more efficient and controllable and promotes the financialization of bulk commodity trade. The digital economy also brings a series of risks and challenges while bringing opportunities to bulk commodity trade. In the context of digital economy, the emerging risks in bulk commodity trade mainly include information security risk, supply chain risk, technology and network security risk. For the emerging risks in the context of the digital economy, this paper proposes corresponding risk management strategies.

Stock exchange operations as a tool for increase in the level of economic security of the enterprise,"The problem of increasing the level of economic security of the enterprise is relevant for enterprises in market conditions of business, which are characterized by a high level of instability. However, in today's conditions of increased instability and increased threats, it is necessary to further deepen the study of the problem in order to find new effective tools for increasing the level of economic security of the enterprise. Exchange transactions are among such instruments. The main components of economic security, which can be positively affected by stock exchange operations, are financial, marketing and production. Prospects for the use of stock exchange operations to increase the level of financial security of the enterprise: operations on the commodity exchange, the purpose of which may be the purchase of production stocks and the sale of products of own production, will allow forecasting the level of expenses and the level of income both by cost and by the time of formation, which has a positive effect on the effectiveness of cash flow management, accordingly, has a positive effect on the level of solvency of the enterprise; operations on the stock market allow you to effectively attract financial resources to ensure the operation of the enterprise, and can also be used for the placement of equity securities of the enterprise and the effective search for co-owners; operations with futures and option contracts with a sufficient level of professional knowledge of the company's specialists will allow to provide the company with production resources and sell the company's products on the most favorable terms. The impact of stock exchange operations on marketing security: the stock market is an effective source of sales of products, within which it is possible to enter into contracts for future supply with a clearly established price level and terms of performance; due to the concentration of potential counterparties, it is possible to increase the volume of sales of the company's products; thanks to the desire to reach the level of the exchange standard, the tendency to increase the quality of products and their competitiveness is ensured; from the point of view of brand development, exchange transactions can have a negative impact, because during exchange trading, depersonalization of products and counterparties and maximum standardization are characteristic. The impact of stock exchange operations on production safety: an increase in the level of product quality to the level of the stock exchange standard, uninterrupted provision of the production process with raw materials and materials, thanks to which downtime can be reduced, the rhythm of production increased and the level of utilization of the production capacity of the enterprise. Therefore, the positive impact of stock exchange operations on the vast majority of functional components of the enterprise's economic security allows to increase its level and achieve the fulfillment of tasks related to increasing the level of competitiveness of the enterprise and ensuring the stability of business conditions.",2024-07-31,

A novel central bank digital currency framework design for offline and foreign transactions based on blockchain,"Purpose Fiat money production necessitates physical commodities, increasing costs and its flow is challenging to monitor, making it vulnerable to criminal exploitation. Cryptocurrencies offer decentralized solutions, but their decentralization has led to illegal activities. Current cross-border transactions face high costs, resource intensity and lack of instant currency transfers. Offline transactions are essential in unreliable networks. Design/methodology/approach Here, the authors proposed the methodology to perform offline transactions based on card, quick response (QR) code and a foreign transaction framework with universal identification (UID) to perform cross-border transactions using blockchain-dependent central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Implications for the financial system are also analyzed. Findings The proposed CBDC framework reduces illegal transactions, corruption and the cost of producing fiat money; eases overseas transactions; and eventually increases international tourism, trade and business between countries. It also reduces the processing fees. Offline framework found useful for performing retail-level transactions. Research limitations/implications The research methodology may face limitations due to diplomatic relations, political instability, sanctions and the need for robust offline transaction infrastructure. Practical implications The proposed CBDC framework simplifies debt and insurance management, tax collection, international trade, tourism and global stock market participation. However, implementing CBDCs in low-income countries presents challenges like extensive training, infrastructure and user acceptance issues. Social implications The adoption of CBDCs can enhance financial stability by reducing corruption and illegal transactions through improved traceability and monitoring, thereby curbing activities like terrorism.

Data transparency and growth in developing economies during and after the global financial crisis,"Abstract The study explores the effects of data transparency on economic growth for developing economies over a unique time period ‐ at the onset of the 2007–2009 global financial crisis and thereafter. Data transparency is defined as the timely production of credible statistics as measured by the statistical capacity indicator. The paper finds that data transparency has a positive effect on real gross domestic product per capita during a period of considerable uncertainty. The estimates indicate an elasticity of the magnitude of 0.03 percent per year, which is much larger than the elasticity of trade openness and schooling in the estimation sample. The empirics employ a variety of econometric estimators, including dynamic panel and cross‐sectional instrumental variables estimators, with the latter approach yielding a higher estimated elasticity. The findings are robust to the inclusion of several factors in addition to political institutions and exogenous commodity‐price and external debt‐financing shocks.",2024-07-30,

Fiscal policy and poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa: is the relationship influenced by the business cycle?,"Purpose The study examined the effect of fiscal policy on poverty in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) while accounting asymmetric (captured by economic downturns) and spillover effects. Design/methodology/approach The study used a fixed effect (within regression) IV model to account for country-specific characteristics. The study also adopts a cross-sectional and spatial dependence-consistent model to account for the potential cross-sectional and temporal dependence in panel data modeling. Findings The study discovered that the effect of fiscal policy on poverty is dependent on the state of the economy. Specifically, we find that fiscal policy helps to reduce the level of poverty during an economic downturn, more than at any other time. More specifically, the findings indicate that the fiscal policy lowers the rate of poverty in SSA, following macroeconomic shocks (captured by the COVID-19 epidemic, the Global Financial Crisis, and the commodity terms of trade shocks). Our findings suggest that fiscal policy is an important policy tool to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic shocks in SSA. Further, the findings also demonstrate that there is a spillover effect of poverty in the region. This implies coordinated, constructive actions by the regional governments can help to lessen the detrimental effects of extreme poverty.

Analisis Manajemen Pelayanan Hotel Syariah Perspektif Standar Pariwisata Halal,"Islamic hotels have become a trend, with many appearing in various cities emphasizing ""syariah."" However, a syariah hotel is not merely about the label; there needs to be clarity on its specifications and criteria to avoid it becoming solely a business commodity. Unlike Islamic financial institutions that have established operational standards, syariah hotels do not have universally defined operational standards set by Islamic bodies such as MUI (Indonesian Ulema Council) or the Department of Religious Affairs. This is a point of ongoing debate in society. This research focuses on the application of halal tourism services in hotels visited by tourists, whether they adhere to syariah principles or not. The objectives of this study are: a) to analyze the management concept of syariah hotel services from the perspective of halal tourism standards at a syariah hotel in Bangkalan, and b) to analyze the supporting and inhibiting factors in the implementation of management standards for syariah hotel services from the perspective of halal tourism standards at a syariah hotel in Bangkalan. This study employs a qualitative descriptive method with a case study approach. Data collection techniques include observation, interviews, and documentation. Data analysis follows Miles and Huberman's model with the following steps: data reduction, data display, and verification. The research findings are as follows: a) The implementation of standardized halal tourism service management at the syariah hotel in Bangkalan complies with syariah principles in its services, as classified under the regulations, particularly Tourism and Creative Economy Regulation No. 12 of 2016 concerning Guidelines for the Operation of Syariah Hotels. The hotel has adjusted its operations since its establishment in anticipation of MUI certification. b) Supporting factors for the implementation of syariah hotel services in Bangkalan include its strategic location and adherence to syariah principles, reinforced by regulations or policies set by the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy No. 12 of 2016 regarding Guidelines for the Operation of Syariah Hotels. However, the inhibiting factor is that the syariah hotel in Bangkalan has not yet obtained MUI's syariah hotel business certificate due to ongoing procedures related to the Regulation of the Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy of the Republic of Indonesia No. 12 of 2016 concerning Guidelines for the Operation of Syariah Hotels.",2024-07-25,
Forecasts of thermal coal prices through Gaussian process regressions,"Given thermal coal's significance as a tactical energy source, price projections for the commodity are crucial for investors and decision-makers alike. The goal of the current work is to determine whether Gaussian process regressions are useful for this forecast problem using a dataset of closing prices of thermal coal traded on the China Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange from January 4, 2016, to December 31, 2020. This is a significant financial index that has not received enough attention in the literature in terms of price forecasting. Our forecasting exercises make use of Bayesian optimizations and cross-validation. The price from January 02, 2020, to December 31, 2020 is successfully predicted by the generated models, with the out-of-sample relative root mean square error of 0.4210%.

Impact of Board Members’ Social Capital on the Resilience of Public Companies to Exogenous Shocks,"The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of board members’ social capital on firms’ market-based metrics of resilience to exogenous shocks. The social capital of directors was measured by their professional, political, and international connections. Firms’ resilience was evaluated based on their ability to resist and recover from the impact of shocks, as determined by stock market data. The data covers the period from 2007 to 2020 for over 200 Russian companies whose shares were included in the calculation of the Moscow Exchange Broad Market Index. During this period, three exogenous shocks occurred: the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, commodity price shock and sanctions in 2014–2015, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The system generalized method of moments is used to estimate the effect of directors’ connections on theability to mitigate shocks, while OLS with robust standard errors is used to reveal the influence of directors’ connections on firms’ ability to recover from shocks. The results indicate that professional connections moderated the negative impact on firms’ resistance to shocks and improved recovery speed during the global financial crisis. However, this type of connection reduced stock recovery speed after the COVID-19 crisis. Political and international connections have different effects on market-based metrics of firm resilience. It is possible that shocks of different nature require firms to leverage various forms of social capital from their directors in order to mitigate the negative effects of such shocks.",2024-07-23,
"Volatility spillover and dynamic correlation between Islamic, conventional, cryptocurrency and precious metal markets during the immediate outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose This paper aims to investigate the immediate effect of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating volatility transmission and dynamic correlation between stock (conventional and Islamic) markets, bitcoin and major commodities such as gold, oil and silver at different investment horizons before and after 161 trading days of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The MGARCH-DCC and maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform -based cross-correlation were used in the estimation of the volatility spillover and continuous wavelet transform in the estimation of the time-varying volatility and correlation between the assets at different investment horizons. Findings The authors observed a sudden correlation breakdown following the COVID-19 shock. Oil (Bitcoin) was a major volatility transmitter before (during) COVID-19. Digital gold (Bitcoin), gold and silver became highly correlated during COVID-19. The highest co-movement between the assets was observed at medium and long-term investment horizons.

Estimation of Optimal Hedge Ratio: A Wild Bootstrap Approach,"This paper proposes a new approach to estimating the minimum variance hedge ratio (MVHR) based on the wild bootstrap and evaluates the approach using a spectrum of conservative to aggressive alternative hedging strategies associated with the percentiles of the MVHR’s bootstrap distribution. This approach is suggested to be more informative and effective relative to the conventional method of hedging solely based on a single-point estimate. Furthermore, the percentile-based MVHRs are robust to influential outliers, non-normality, and unknown forms of heteroskedasticity. The bootstrap percentile-based hedging strategies’ effectiveness is compared with those from the naïve method and the asymmetric DCC-GARCH model for a range of financial assets and commodities. The bootstrap percentile-based hedging technique is identified to outperform its alternatives in terms of hedging effectiveness, downside risk, and return variability, suggesting its superiority to other methods in both the literature and in practice.",2024-07-20,

Challenges and Prospects of Establishing Accounting Treatment Standards for Digital Currency,"Digital Currency have emerged as a disruptive force in the financial world, challenging traditional accounting practices and regulatory frameworks. This study examines the challenges and prospects for establishing accounting standards for Digital Currency. Initially conceived as a secure medium of exchange, Digital Currency have evolved into assets that can be exchanged for goods or services. However, their dual role as currencies and commodities presents a classification dilemma. Current accounting standards primarily classify Digital Currency as intangible assets, but their rapid appreciation renders historical cost measurement ineffective. Adopting fair value measurement emerges as an optimal solution, but practical hurdles remain.

On the Problem of Rationality of Economic Choice in the Context of Psychological Factors,"The problem of economic choice and its rationality has now become the subject of research in social sciences. An economic choice is considered rational, as a result of which, by making certain expenses, a person satisfies his needs to the maximum extent. Limited resources force a person to use financial resources sparingly to satisfy as many needs as possible. The classical economic approach assumes that when making economic choices a person is not influenced by others because the needs and preferences which are determined by individual psychophysiological features, are mostly stable. Currently, there are three main trends in economic theory: neoclassical, institutional and evolutionary which are based on the principles of absolute or limited rationality of economic behavior. In this article by the term “rational economic choice” we mean the choice that best meets a person’s expectations and in which case the expected utility function takes on a maximum value. By the utility function, economists mean the functions expressing the dependence of the amount of goods and services used by the economic subject in a given period and the costs incurred by him. The utility function expresses the relationships between the person’s preferences and actions aimed at satisfying needs. Preferences and actions in the article are considered in the context of psychological factors. The article presents a number of approaches related to the rationality of economic choice. The problem of rationality is considered with the help of a utility function given on the commodity-money space . We proceeded with the economic principle that no matter what factors determine the economic behavior of a person, the solution to the problem of satisfying his material and spiritual needs will ultimately lead to the problem of cost reduction. We determined the effectiveness of the sample not only by the amount of financial expenses incurred by the realization of the selection, but also by the preference given to the sample, which is a psychophysiological feature of the person.",2024-07-16,
"Renewable Energy, Economic Policy Uncertainty and Climate Policy Uncertainty: New Evidence for Environmental Kuznets Curve from Emerging and Developed Countries","Recent events, such as the financial crisis, oil price shocks or fluctuations, Brexit, the US–China trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine conflict and the subsequent energy crisis, have surged global economic policy uncertainty. As climate change has recently been more pronounced around the globe, discussions about climate policies and related uncertainties have also become a major concern. This study investigates the role of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on climate change (environmental degradation) for selected emerging and developed economies, expanding the IPAT framework and merging it with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The IPAT framework examines the impact (I) of population (P), affluence (A), and technology (T) on the environment, whereas the EKC hypothesis proposes an inverted U-shaped curve between affluence and environmental degradation. Two models were created and tested for emerging and developed countries, namely Model 1 with EPU and Model 2 with CPU. A Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator is employed to investigate the interrelation between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and selected variables; namely the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, squared real GDP per capita, renewable share in consumption, the EPU, the CPU and population. Test results indicate that the EKC hypothesis is verified only in Model 1 and for emerging countries, whereas population escalates climate change in both country groups. Furthermore, in line with the consumption effect theorized earlier in the literature, EPU is negatively related to carbon emissions in emerging countries. Thus, the EPU leads to a decrease in the use of energy and pollution-intensive commodities and mitigates climate change in EMEs. Compatible with our ex-ante expectations, renewable energy consumption alleviates climate change in both country groups in the short term. In Model 2, with CPU, we find no evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis for any country groups. However, we reaffirm that renewable energy consumption decreases CO2 emissions in developed countries, which is in support of the argument that energy transition holds the key to tackling climate change. Finally, CPU is associated with a decrease in CO2 emissions in emerging countries in the short term, potentially leading to a reduction in overall economic activity and alleviating climate change. This might also be attributable to the fact that the decisions of economic agents substantially rely on current and future policy (both economic and climate) expectations. Overall, verifying the EKC hypothesis for emerging countries in Model 1, we might argue that there is good potential for emerging countries to save money and time on environmental costs via the adoption of clean technologies and related policies. Last but not least, on a global scale, energy transition with better utilization of renewable sources holds the key to tackling climate change and reducing emissions.",2024-07-15,

Gold Production and the Global Energy Transition—A Perspective,"Gold is neither a critical mineral nor a metal that is central to the global energy transition in terms of demand from new energy production technologies. Yet, gold is unique among mined commodities for its role in financial markets and for its global production footprint including in numerous developing economies. Since the production of gold incurs CO2 emissions and other environmental risks including water pollution and land degradation, gold producers seek to adopt clean production solutions through electrification and renewable energy adoption. Further, gold’s unique role as a store of value creates new potential green business models in gold, such as the digitalisation of in-ground gold inventories, which can further reduce negative environmental externalities from gold mining. A net-zero emissions, future global gold industry, is possible. Major gold producers are targeting net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050, coupled with a lower overall environmental footprint to meet heightened societal expectations for cleaner production. An analysis of emissions data from Australian gold mines shows systematic differences between mining operations. Further clean energy investment in gold production is required to reduce emission levels towards the target of net zero.",2024-07-12,

Contagion in Commodity Markets under Financial Stress,"The relevance of the study is due to the fact that in the conditions of the financialization of the economy, shocks arising in one market can spread rapidly and intensively to other markets, generating the effects of financial contagion. This fully applies to the commodity markets, which occupy a large share of exchange trading. The resulting excess volatility risks should be taken into account both by financial market players when developing optimal portfolio strategies, and by the state when adjusting anti-crisis policy. The purpose of the study is to identify financial contagion in commodity markets during periods of financial stress caused by the pandemic and sanctions, to determine the direction and extent of intermarket contagion. The novelty of the study lies in the construction of stress indices to separate periods of increased volatility in commodity markets, in the application of statistical tests for the co-moments of the return distribution to identify the financial contagion between the markets of energy (oil and gas), precious and non-ferrous metals during the pandemic and sanctions. The result of the study is the identification of a period of increased volatility in commodity markets and its division into two sub-periods based on turning points in the stress index, establishing the direction and extent of financial contagion between commodity markets during these periods. It is concluded that stress in commodity markets is accompanied by intense financial contagion. Moreover, volatility contagion turns out to be higher than return contagion and even higher than contagion caused by anomalies in the return distribution. The main sources and receivers of contagion in different periods are the markets of precious and some non-ferrous metals, and in the period from February 2018 to December 2020, also the oil market. At the same time, the gas market before SMO has demonstrated relative independence from other commodity markets, which made it possible to recommend gas futures as a tool for hedging investment portfolios during a period of increased financial stress.",2024-07-12,

ANALYSIS OF THE APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM MICRO ENTITIES IN MSMEs,"The various cultures that exist in Indonesia can be processed and turned into commodities with market value so that they become the basis for the growth of micro, small and medium businesses. However, it needs to be emphasized that MSME players still lack awareness and must be provided with education regarding the relevance of financial openness in their businesses. So far, the MSME registration procedure is still quite simple. In fact, some of them have not documented or prepared financial reports in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards for Micro, Small and Medium Entities (SAK EMKM) which have just been established. This research aims to describe whether the financial reports of the Irin Jaya Cakalang Fish Processing UMKM in Bojong Village are in accordance with SAK EMKM or not. Data collection was carried out by means of interviews, observation and documentation. This research uses a qualitative method with a descriptive approach.

Suffering Together: Photos and Stories of Nsukka Residents During Nigeria's 2023 Currency Redesign Crisis,"The Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) attempt to redesign the 200, 500, and 1000 naira notes by December 2022 led to a cash crunch and humanitarian crisis, exposing the federal government's shortsightedness and inherent weakness. Amidst the crisis that peaked between late January and February 2023, opportunities for social connections and shared experiences emerged. In this essay and visual archive, I explore the financial crisis phenomenon in Nsukka metropolis, Southeastern Nigeria, from a historical perspective, integrating personal insights, respondents' views, and archival sources. Analysis of observational notes, visual and textual data through the lens of Critical Theory reveals the importance of social connection and cultural ideology among Nsukka residents during a difficult time in Nigerian history. Photographic images of crowded bank scenes and remarks like ""You are not the only person"" evoke personal and public misery and frustration during the currency redesign crisis.

Peran Agroteknologi dalam Mendorong Pertanian Inovatif Berkelanjutan di Kabupaten Labuhanbatu,"This research aims to explore the perceptions, attitudes, challenges and strategies of farmers in Labuhanbatu Regency in adopting agrotechnology to encourage sustainable innovative agriculture. Using a qualitative approach, data was collected through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with farmers representing various agricultural commodities. The research results show that the majority of farmers have a positive perception of agrotechnology, such as smart irrigation and superior plant varieties, which are considered capable of increasing agricultural productivity and efficiency. However, the adoption of this technology is faced with various challenges, including lack of knowledge and training, financial limitations, access to technology, and less than optimal institutional support. Farmers overcome this challenge with several strategies, such as utilizing social networks to share information and experiences, seeking education and training independently, as well as collaborating with the private sector and utilizing government assistance. These findings highlight the importance of sustainable, locally needs-based outreach and training programs, as well as policies that support more affordable access to technology and funding. This research also shows that synergy between various stakeholders, including government, the private sector, and extension institutions, is essential to encourage wider adoption of agrotechnology.

LOGISTICS COSTS AS AN OBJECT OF MANAGEMENT IN THE ACCOUNTING AND ANALYTICAL SYSTEM OF AN ENTERPRISE,"The article studies the conceptual content, nature and essence of logistics costs as an object of management in the accounting and analytical system of enterprise. It is determined that the subject of study and research of logistics is a complex purposeful flow process that combines material, financial, information, commodity, labour, human and other flows. In many domestic scientific publications on logistics, material and related information and financial flows are called logistics flows. The article substantiates the need to identify the cost flow in the study of logistics costs, which is proposed to be understood as a part of the working capital / fixed capital in monetary terms, formed because of the impact of operations for the purpose of transformation, movement of elements of material, information and financial flows, attributed to a certain time interval. The introduction and substantiation of a new object of study - the cost flow as a source of logistics costs, accompanying material, financial, and information flows, is more practical in nature, the study of its spatial, quantitative, and temporal parameters in real time is the most effective source of information for logistics management, which performs the functions of ensuring and controlling the process of implementing the logistics management approach. The very understanding of the essence of logistics costs is interconnected with the scientific and practical vision of logistics. There are many multidirectional and often contradictory definitions, the main ones of which consider logistics as an economic process, as a sphere and functions of management and as a science. It is proved that the importance of each element of the classification of logistics costs is different for enterprises of different industries. The generalised classification should allow combining important aspects from the point of view of organisation of the management process, namely: allocating logistics costs for the three main phases of movement of material flows (procurement, production, sales), determining the areas of expenditure (costs of storage, transportation, sales and costs associated with maintenance of logistics infrastructure), grouping costs by business processes and participants of business processes.",2024-07-05,
"The impact of cryptocurrency-related cyberattacks on return, volatility, and trading volume of cryptocurrencies and traditional financial assets","We investigate the impact of cryptocurrency-related cyberattacks on the cryptocurrency market and traditional financial markets. The dataset consists of historical cyberattack data and trading data for twenty cryptocurrencies, three cryptocurrency uncertainty indices, five payment companies, four stock indices, a commodity index, and gold. We find that cyberattacks are associated with negative returns, increased volatility, and increased trading volume not only for the cryptocurrencies but also for the payment companies, the financial and technology sectors, and the general stock market. However, the impact of cyberattacks on cryptocurrencies has been decreasing over time, while the impact on payment companies and the financial sector has been increasing.

Change in farmer expectations from information surprises in the corn market,"Abstract Farmers make production decisions despite future output price uncertainty. As a result, farmers' expectation of future output price is an important determinant of investment and the supply of commodities. However, our understanding of the process by which farmers form their expectations is still limited. This study uses direct measures of farmers' financial condition expectations collected through the Purdue University–CME Group Ag Economy Barometer to measure the effect of surprise information on farmers' short‐ and long‐term expectations. The effect is identified using an event study framework previously used to examine the impact of market information on commodity futures markets. Using ordered logistic regressions and variation between professional and United States Department of Agriculture forecasts of corn ending stocks, we demonstrate that farmers' short‐term expectations of the financial condition of the broader agricultural economy is altered by surprise information. This study provides a novel step toward understanding the process by which farmers incorporate new information in their price expectations. For example, our findings suggest that farmers perceive short‐term corn market information surprises will affect the U.S. agricultural sector to a greater degree than their farm. Additionally, farmers do not perceive that short‐term corn market information surprises will carry long‐term implications.",2024-07-03,
What drives the price behavior of US sustainable stocks?,"Purpose This paper aims to identify the key drivers of US sustainable stock price movements in both the short and long term, deploying a rich collection of variables corresponding to green finance, investor attention and sentiment, market fear and uncertainty, macroeconomic variables, common market risk factors, commodity markets and the carbon emission market. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis is based on two main methodologies. First, the elastic net penalized regression is utilized to select the factors most influential on the price formation of sustainable stocks. Second, short- and long-run dynamics of the chosen factors are examined using the dynamic simulations of the autoregressive distributed lag (DYNARDL) model. Findings Of 32 candidate variables, the elastic net chooses US renewable energy, European sustainable stock market, EU ETS emission allowances, public attention to sustainable finance, gold and European renewable energy as the most contributing factors to the price behavior of sustainable stocks. The DYNARDL estimation results reveal that US renewable energy, European sustainable stock market and EU ETS emission allowances are important determinants in the short and long term, while public attention (European renewable energy) tends to affect sustainable stock prices only in the short (long) run. Practical implications The corresponding short- and long-run effects of US renewable energy, EU ETS emission allowances and European sustainable stocks on US sustainable stock prices should induce policymakers to keep the price behavior of these factors under systematic review. The formulation of policy measures could serve to safeguard the sustainable stock market from the price vagaries in these influential markets. Originality/value Relevant literature often focuses on the reaction of sustainable stocks to mainstream assets and risk proxies, limiting analysis to a few factors and providing an incomplete understanding of the drivers behind sustainable stock prices. More comprehensive research is needed due to the lack of studies on the determinants of sustainable stock prices and the growing global demand for these investments. This paper aims to address this gap by examining the potential explanatory power of 32 candidate factors representing key players in the global economic and financial landscape.",2024-07-03,
The impact of risk factors on the sustainability of food distribution chain functioning in Kazakhstan,"In conditions of risk and uncertainty, food security is ensured taking into account the requirements of isolation, safety and health, which requires changes to the existing supply chain (SC) system in the food environment, as well as the creation of more sustainable food supply chains. The aim of the study is to assess the conditions and factors of the functioning of the food commodity distribution chain (FCDC) of the agri-food market in conditions of risk, in particular, the COVID-19 pandemic. To formulate a conceptual framework reflecting the structure of the SC elements, the method of systematic review and generalization of literature was used; the method of expert survey of participants in the SC of food products (FP). During the analysis, seven significant factor constraints (technological, financial, economic, institutional, social, epidemiological, geographical) were revealed, the environment and operating conditions of the FCDC associated with the impact of the pandemic were identified. The risk factors of the environment and operating conditions of the FCDC and their possible effects on the SC are evaluated.

Economic policy uncertainty and Indian equity sectors: a quantile regression approach,"Purpose This paper aims to investigate the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) shocks on Indian equity market sectors. The effect of domestic (Indian) and foreign (USA) EPU shocks is examined on ten major Bombay Stock Exchange sectors. Design/methodology/approach The study uses data covering the period from September 2005 to July 2023 and uses the methodology of quantile regression to investigate the heterogenous response of stock market sectors under diverse market conditions explained through the analysis of conditional quantiles distribution. Findings The results demonstrate that domestic and foreign EPU shocks negatively affect most of the sectors in bearish market conditions. Industrials, commodities, utilities, consumer discretionary and financial services are the most affected sectors by domestic EPU. However, the information technology sector is found to be immune to domestic EPU shocks but negatively affected by foreign EPU shocks. On the other hand, energy, financial services and fast-moving consumer goods sectors are found to be immune to foreign EPU shocks but are negatively affected by domestic EPU shocks. Practical implications Understanding the heterogeneous response of different sectors to EPU shocks could help investors and portfolio managers identify portfolio diversification opportunities.

Chemically Recyclable Se-Containing Plastics from a Cascade Multicomponent Polymerization,"Open AccessCCS ChemistryRESEARCH ARTICLES2 Jul 2024Chemically Recyclable Se-Containing Plastics from a Cascade Multicomponent Polymerization Xinchen Yue, Xiaoxian Lu, Chengjian Zhang and Xinghong Zhang Xinchen Yue , Xiaoxian Lu , Chengjian Zhang *Corresponding authors: E-mail Address: [email protected] E-mail Address: [email protected] and Xinghong Zhang *Corresponding authors: E-mail Address: [email protected] E-mail Address: [email protected] Cite this: CCS Chemistry. 2024;0:1–9https://doi.org/10.31635/ccschem.024.202404338 SectionsSupplemental MaterialAboutAbstractPDF ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked InEmail Researchers are pursuing promising chemically recyclable polymers. Here, we demonstrate a series of recyclable Se-containing polyesters from the first reported cascade multicomponent polymerization of elemental Se, H2O, CO, and diacrylate. The polymerization is considered to be through a cascade mechanism: Se is first reduced by CO to COSe; COSe is then reduced by H2O to H2Se; H2Se is finally coupled with diacrylate to form a polymer. The method uses common organic bases as a catalyst and is performed under mild conditions with high yields. The obtained polymer is thermally stable with a tunable melting point, and can be easily depolymerized to Se and diacrylate by H2O2 under mild conditions. Owing to the versatile synthesis, the structure/properties of the polymer are scalable, such as P4 and P5 with high-density polyethylene-like mechanical performance. Overall, the polymer is a promising material owing to its modular synthesis, practical recyclability, scalable performance, and commercial raw materials. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction Polymer research has entered its second century since Staudinger's first polymerization report published in 1920.1 Synthetic polymers have played a tremendous role in all aspects of our lives, from materials for cars, aircrafts, and buildings to clothing, packaging, and biomedical devices.2 However, due to today's growing concerns about the environment and sustainability, the reputation of synthetic polymers is being severely corrupted.3,4 Because of the high durability, 59% of all polymers made (∼8600 Mt) are discarded and end up in landfills or accumulate in the ocean, while only 17% are recycled or incinerated.5–7 In particular, the amount of single-use plastics (such as masks and gloves) has tremendously increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, most synthetic polymers are derived from nonrenewable fossil feedstocks,8,9 resulting in unsustainable production when they cannot be recycled/reused. In the current second century of polymer science, we have to accelerate the green revolution in synthetic polymers. The development of chemically recyclable polymers offers a particularly attractive approach to address the challenges of polymer sustainability.10–34 Hydrolysis or alcoholysis of the ester bond can enable the recycling of polyesters, as reported by Mecking,35 Coates,36,37 and other groups.38 We also reported hydrolysis to realize the chemical cycle of sulfur-containing polyesters synthesized from carbonyl sulfide, diacrylates, and H2O/diols.39,40 However, hydrolysis and alcoholysis methods are energy-intensive and use a large amount of strong bases or acids. Furthermore, the polycondensation method used in polyester synthesis usually requires energy-intensive consumption. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable selenium (Se)-containing polyesters from the first reported cascade multicomponent polymerization of elemental Se, H2O, carbon monoxide (CO), and diacrylate (Figure 1). This method features the characteristics of commercial raw materials, mild polymerization conditions, a common base as the catalyst, high yield, and versatile synthesis. The produced polymers possess widely tunable structures/properties and Se-giving functionality. The Se-containing polyesters can be easily depolymerized by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is more environmentally friendly than the use of strong bases or acids for polyester degradation. In addition, the incorporation of Se atoms into the polymer to endow new features has attracted widespread attention.41–48 Se-containing polymers have shown unusual prospects as biomaterials, redox responsive materials, optical materials, electrically conducting polymers, and so on.49–52 The advancement of new Se-containing polymers and their practical synthesis methods is highly desired.

Instrumentation Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were performed on a Bruker Advance DMX 400 MHz (Billerica, Massachusetts, United States). Infrared spectra of polymer samples were recorded on Nicolet iS20 attenuated total reflection spectrometer (Waltham, Massachusetts, United States). The weight-average molecular weight and distribution of the polymers were determined with a PL-GPC 220 chromatograph equipped with an HP 1100 pump from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, California, United States). Calibration was performed using monodisperse polystyrene (PS) standards. The decomposition temperatures of the polymers were determined by TAQ 50 instrument (New Castle, Delaware, United States). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of polymers were carried out on a TAQ 200 instrument (New Castle, Delaware, United States) with a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min. The data reported are from second heating cycles. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry was carried out on a Waters GCT Premier (Milford, Massachusetts, United States). Representative procedure for reactions Taking the synthesis of P1 as an example. A 20 mL high pressure reactor with magnetic stirrer was dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight. Then the reactor was taken into the glove box and cooled in nitrogen atmosphere. In the glove box, 1,4-butylene glycol diacrylate (0.861 g, 3.33 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added into the reactor first. Selenium powder (0.2896 g, 3.66 mmol, 1.10 equiv) and ultrapure water (69 μL, 3.83 mmol, 1.15 equiv) were then added into the reactor. Then N-methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclododecene (MTBD; 19.2 μL, 0.14 mmol, 0.04 equiv) was added into the reactor. After that, tetrahydrofuran (THF; 1 mL) was added as solvent. The reactor was then sealed and charged with CO (1.5 MPa). The reaction was carried out at 60 °C for 6 h. After that, the reactor was cooled in a water bath. Next, the crude product was quenched with HCl in ethanol (1 mol/L). The crude product was dissolved with THF and then precipitated in ethanol. The product was collected by decantation and dried in vacuum at 60 °C until a constant weight. Results and Discussion Elemental Se is used as an easily accessible source of Se in our method, which is a byproduct from the metal refinery industry and has low toxicity.53 CO is the essential chemical for industrial manufacturing of abundant organic and inorganic products.54 The polymerization is proposed to undergo a cascade mechanism: under the reduction capacity of CO, elemental Se is first reduced to carbonyl selenide (COSe); then, hydrolysis of COSe generates hydrogen selenide (H2Se) and CO2; finally, H2Se is coupled with the electron-deficient C=C bond of diacrylates to generate a polymer (Figure 2a). The organic base can efficiently catalyze the above cascade reactions under mild conditions, resulting in a metal-free and efficient polymerization method. Additionally, cascade and multicomponent polymerization methods have gained significant attention because of their unique transformation and convenience.55–61 This study has developed a new cascade multicomponent polymerization to facilitate the synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers.

Download figure Download PowerPoint We monitored chemical transformations during the polymerization process through an in situ infrared (IR) spectrometer technique (Figure 2b–e and Supporting Information Figures S1–S3). We used 1,10-decanediyl diacrylate and MTBD as the representative diacrylate and organic catalyst, respectively. Figure 2b shows the time-dependent two-dimensional (2D) stack plot of the in situ IR spectra of the polymerization. The peaks at 1721 and 1736 cm−1 are attributed to the C=O bond in the diacrylate and polymer, respectively. As shown in Figure 2c, the stacked in situ IR profile of the peak at 1736 cm−1 grows over time and approaches saturation nearly at 140 min, while the peak at 1721 cm−1 decreases over time and eventually remains stable. The changes in these peaks clearly reflect the real-time polymerization process. Accordingly, the resulting polymers possess weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of 3.7, 4.2, 12.6, 55.8, and 81.7 kDa at 60, 120, 180, 240, and 360 min, respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The peak at 1590 cm−1 in the IR spectrum (Figure 2b) is attributed to the C=O bond in COSe, which first gradually increases and then disappears, consistent with the proposed cascade polymerization mechanism. In the MTBD-catalyzed reaction of CO and elemental Se, we clearly observed the production of COSe through the growth of the peak at 1590 cm−1 (Figure 2d). Additionally, from the MTBD-catalyzed reaction of CO, Se, and H2O, the production and hydrolysis of COSe was determined by the increase and disappearance of the peak at 1590 cm−1 during the reaction process (Figure 2e). By comparing the in situ IR spectra in Figure 2d,e, we proposed that the hydrolysis of COSe promotes the production of COSe from CO and Se. To our knowledge, this study reveals for the first time the Michael addition of H2Se and activated olefins to form a polymer. Furthermore, compared with the direct use of H2Se,62,63 the method of using CO, Se, and H2O has a price advantage. After understanding the cascade polymerization mechanism, we then synthesized various Se-containing polyesters from diverse diacrylates with this method. Diacrylate is a promising raw material for polymer synthesis, which has a wide variety and is industrially produced from the esterification of (biorenewable) diols and acrylic acid ( Supporting Information Figures S4–S8).64 The optimized polymerization conditions include: THF as a solvent, feeding liquids and solids under nitrogen conditions, the feeding ratio of [Se]0/[H2O]0/[diacrylate]0/[catalyst] = 110/115/100/4, at 1.5 MPa CO pressure, at 60 °C for 6 h ( Supporting Information Tables S1–S3). When conducted in air, the polymerization always yields crosslinked and insoluble polymers, which are generated from the free radical polymerization of diacrylates. Trace amounts of oxygen in the air act as free radical initiators. Because the selenium powder is heterogeneous in the polymerization system, uniform stirring to fully disperse the selenium powder is necessary for obtaining a high molecular weight polymer. THF as a solvent can visibly disperse selenium powder better than other solvents, thus yielding the polymer with higher molecular weights ( Supporting Information Table S1). The selenium powder disappears during the polymerization. Probably due to the incomplete reaction of Se and H2O, their small excess is conducive to the synthesis of high-MW polymers ( Supporting Information Table S3). The common organic bases of MTBD and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-7-undecene were determined as effective catalysts for the polymerization ( Supporting Information Table S4). Among the alkaline catalysts used, these two catalysts are relatively tolerant to water, thus affording the polymer with higher molecular weights ( Supporting Information Table S4). Under the optimized polymerization conditions, we used commercial diacrylates (1,4-butanediol diacrylate, 1,5-pentanediyl diacrylate, 1,6-hexanediyl diacrylate, 1,9-nonanediol diacrylate, and 1,10-decanediyl diacrylate) to synthesize P1 to P5 with high yields of 88%–93% calculated by gravimetry (Figure 3a). Such polymers possess high Mw of 81.2–147.2 kDa and dispersities (Đ) of 1.6–2.2, as determined by GPC in THF calibrated with a PS standard ( Supporting Information Table S5 and Figures S9–S22). Also, the GPC with triple detectors (refractive index, intrinsic viscosity, and light scattering detectors) was employed to determine the absolute molecular weight of the polymer. The absolute Mw of P4 is determined as 79.0 kDa (Đ = 2.2, Supporting Information Figure S19), which is comparable to the relative Mw of 81.2 kDa (Đ = 2.2). P1 is weakly crystalline, which exhibits a glass transition temperature (Tg) of −54 °C and a melting temperature (Tm) of 47 °C, as determined by DSC (Figure 3b). P2 and P3 are amorphous and exhibit Tg values of −58 and −60 °C, respectively (Figure 3b). Such afforded polymers are colorless or yellowish. The chemicals, including elemental Se, CO, H2O, diacrylates, and catalysts, were used directly as purchased without any purification.

(f) Stress–strain curves of P7 to P9. Download figure Download PowerPoint Owing to the incorporation of long carbon chains,65,66 P4 and P5 are crystalline and exhibit Tms of 43 and 47 °C, respectively. Via further increases in the number of carbon atoms to 22, P6 exhibits a higher Tm of 69 °C. Because of the relatively low solubility in THF during the polymerization, P6 possesses a lower Mw of 39.4 kDa (Đ of 1.4, Supporting Information Figures S23–S25). P4 and P5 demonstrate excellent melt processing and high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-like mechanical properties. By stress–strain experiments, the specimens of P4 and P5 prepared by melt processing show the ultimate tensile strength (σB) of 25.4 ± 1.9 and 27.1 ± 2.4 MPa, an elongation at break (ϵB) of 441 ± 28% and 557 ± 34%, and calculated Young's modulus (E) of 117 ± 16 and 126 ± 5 MPa (Figure 3c). Figure 3d demonstrates the potential application of P5 in packaging materials. Due to the low molecular weight, the specimens of P6 exhibit relatively weak toughness with a σB of 15.6 ± 0.5 MPa, ϵB of 58 ± 4%, and E of 80 ± 3 MPa. To further improve the Tm of the Se-containing polyesters, we then synthesized P7 using commercially available hexadecafluoro-1,10-decanediol as a raw material ( Supporting Information Figures S26–S28). Because of the incorporation of a large amount of fluorine atoms that have strong negative charge and small volume, P7 is highly crystalline and exhibits a high Tm of 113 °C (Figure 3e). Due to the relatively low solubility in THF during the polymerization, P7 possesses a low Mw of 34.5 kDa (Đ of 1.4). The specimens of P7 are brittle and exhibit σB of 15.7 ± 0.6 MPa, ϵB of 17 ± 1%, and E of 108 ± 4 MPa (Figure 3f). To improve the mechanical properties of the polymer, we then added 1 mol % trimethylolpropane triacrylate to the polymerization system to yield the slightly cross-linked P8 with Mw of 40.2 kDa and Đ of 2.9 ( Supporting Information Figures S29–S31). P8 shows a high Tm of 113 °C (Figure 3e), good melt processing, and enhanced mechanical properties with σB of 23.5 ± 4.6 MPa, ϵB of 115 ± 20%, and E of 134 ± 5 MPa (Figure 3f). Furthermore, the optimized combination of 2 mol % trimethylolpropane triacrylate, 48 mol % hexadecafluoro-1,10-decanediol diacrylate, and 50 mol % 1,10-decanediol diacrylate yielded P9 with high Mw of 86.1 kDa and Đ of 2.4 ( Supporting Information Figures S32–S34). P9 demonstrates a Tm of 76 °C (Figure 3e), good solubility in THF, good melt processing, and improved mechanical properties with σB of 16.9 ± 2.1 MPa, ϵB of 416 ± 104%, and E of 70 ± 12 MPa (Figure 3f and Supporting Information Figures S35–S40). Notably, fluorinated polymers have shown interesting properties, such as chemical and thermal stability, low dielectric constant and refractive index, and low surface tension.67,68 This study provides a facile synthesis of fluorinated polymers. Both the obtained polymers ( P1 to P9) are thermally stable, which exhibit high decomposition temperatures (Td, at polymer decomposition of 5% in mass fraction) of 228–276 °C, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis ( Supporting Information Figures S41–S49). The polymers also exhibit high chemical stability in air. As an example, the Td of P5 in air (265 °C, Supporting Information Figure S50) is similar to that (264 °C) in a N2 atmosphere. In addition, after 536 days of storage, the Mw of P5 decreased slightly from 80.6 to 79.3 kDa ( Supporting Information Figure S51). Also, the appearance and color of the polymer have hardly changed. We also examined the oxidation-triggered depolymerization of the Se-containing polyesters. Xu and coworkers69 reported the oxidation-elimination process of a β-selenylated carbonyl compound by H2O2. The proposed decomposition mechanism is demonstrated in Figure 4a: it is first oxidized to a selenoxide structure that undergoes a syn elimination to form an acrylate and a selenenic acid; then the unstable selenenic acid undergoes another syn elimination, affording another acrylate along with elemental Se and H2O. Owing to the incorporation of unique β-selenylated carbonyl unit in main chain, our polymers are readily depolymerized through the oxidation of H2O2 ( Supporting Information Figures S52–S72). During the preparation of this study, Xu and coworkers70 reported an unprecedented β-selenocarbonyl-containing polyurethane can be degraded into valuable selenium fertilizers under mild conditions. H2O2 is a valuable oxidation reagent required for many industrial uses and can decompose into nontoxic O2 and H2O.

(b) 1H NMR spectra of the initial diacrylate, P5, and regenerated diacrylate. (c) GPC curves of the original and regenerated P5. (d) Images for monitoring the depolymerization process of P5 specimens mixed with common plastics. Download figure Download PowerPoint Taking the chemical recycle of P5 as an example, 0.75 g P5 was first completely depolymerized at 60 °C overnight in the presence of 2.17 mL 30% H2O2 (10 equiv relative to the amount of P5 units) and 80 mL THF as a solvent. Then, by the simple distillation in vacuum of the depolymerization mixture, 73 mL pure THF was recovered in 91% yield, while the mixture of 1,5-pentanediyl diacrylate and Se powder is left in the bottle. Finally, by filtration of the mixture, the diacrylate was recovered in 71% yield (0.41 g) with >99% purity determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry ( Supporting Information Figure S62) and 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 4b), while elemental Se was recovered in 72% yield (0.12 g). The recovered selenium was in a red amorphous form that was converted to the original black form by heating at 100 °C for several hours. We also used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to determine the valence state of the recovered Se ( Supporting Information Figure S73). The major binding energies of the recovered Se were measured at 55 eV, which was attributed to Se (0).70 A small peak at 59 eV that is attributed to Se (IV) in the form of selenenic acid. By comparing the XPS spectra of purchased Se powder and recovered Se, the recovered Se possesses more selenenic acid. For the repolymerization process, with [Se]0/[H2O]0/[diacrylate]0/[MTBD] = 110/115/100/4, at 1.5 MPa CO, at 60 °C for 6 h, the recovered Se and diacrylate combined with CO and H2O yielded the regenerated P5 with Mw of 77.4 kDa (Đ of 1.5) that is comparable to that of the original P5 (Figure 4c). We also demonstrated the H2O2-enabled depolymerization of P5 mixed with various common plastics including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene, PS, polyvinyl chloride, polyamide, and polyethylene terephthalate. Because of the high durability toward H2O2, the common plastics can be easily separated from the depolymerization mixture, leading to the easy-to-handle depolymerization process (Figure 4d and Supporting Information Figure S72). Conclusion We have demonstrated diverse recyclable Se-containing polyesters from the cascade multicomponent polymerization of Se, H2O, CO, and diacrylate. Owing to the versatile method and the wide variety of diacrylates, the structure and properties of the polymer have a lot of room for expansion, such as P4 and P5 with HDPE-like mechanical properties and P8 and P9 with a high Tm of 113 °C. The polymerization method is carried out under mild conditions, uses common organic bases as a catalyst, and affords polymers with high yields and high Mw of up to 147.2 kDa. The depolymerization of the polymer is easy to handle through the oxidation of H2O2, resulting in the recovery of diacrylates and elemental Se with high yields. By the modular polymer synthesis method, the ongoing work will pursue more Se-containing polymers with chemical recyclability, desired functionality, and high performance.

“The mother of every insane form: fetishistic interest and capitalistic perversion”,"Money is the epitome of Marx's fetishised commodity. And, in Marxist discussions of the connected topics of currency and commodity fetishism, it often is left under-appreciated that such fetishism reaches its apotheosis only with the development of 'interest-bearing capital.' Herein, I perform two complementary gestures, one as regards Marxism and another with respect to psychoanalysis. Apropos Marxism, I counter-balance the usual, long-standing (over)emphasis on commodity fetishism as per the first volume of Das Kapital with a foregrounding of this fetishism as per the third volume. Apropos psychoanalysis, I shift away from its traditional fixation on reducing financial matters to libidinal contents. I explore instead the implications of the forms of capitalist fetishism for reconsidering the forms of intra-subjective defence mechanisms. This leads me to posit a complementary inversion of Lacan's dictum according to which 'repression is always the return of the repressed': The return of the repressed sometimes is the most effective repression. To pose a rhetorical question paraphrasing Brecht: What is the laundering of money compared with the laundering that is money?",2024-07-02,
Foreign trade and domestic networks — A few remarks on the organisation of tributary embassies to China in the Muromachi period,"The aim of this article is to rethink the connection between foreign trade and domestic economy in late medieval Japan.The article takes a look at the financial side of the tributary missions to Ming China, investigating how commodities for tribute and for trade were organised. In the 1970s, Sasaki Gin’ya was the first to criticise that research on foreign trade and research on the domestic economy were being conducted separately. He emphasised the importance of complex interdisciplinary research in order to reveal the connection between foreign trade and the domestic economy. Even though this issue had been previously raised, no research had been conducted with the explicit purpose of connecting foreign trade and the domestic economy during the Muromachi period until the past two decades. Contributions that have been made in recent years have aimed at revealing the connections between domestic commercial or religious networks with foreign relations, mainly focusing on the role of Zen monks in diplomacy and trade and on the import and distribution of commodities from China. In Western scholarship, this topic is still under-researched and provides potential for further investigations. Thus, the paper tries to provide an inventory of case studies that help us imagine and understand what kinds of connections existed between domestic networks and foreign trade in medieval Japan that made the procuring of tribute items and commercial products for official trade in China possible. Being aware of networks in medieval society, such as the religious network—and also closely connected to that the commercial network—of Honganji or Tenryūji, can help us connect the scattered and loose information in the sources, in order to explain what contributed to the development of foreign trade. The paper argues that despite the weakening of shogunal power, tributary trade continued because the structure of ship management transformed. Tribute ships became part of commercial ventures backed by the flourishing late medieval Japanese economy, and the increase of capital led to an increase in investors who were ready to participate in trade with China. The way that products were procured shows different patterns that provide good examples to help us understand how local commercial, social, and religious networks were utilised for procuring Japanese commodities.",2024-07-01,
Exploring the interconnection between international crude oil and silver rates volatilities: Novel evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic,"Several research studies globally focus on the volatility of gold and oil prices, neglecting an examination of silver price volatility in relation to other market commodities. The current Covid-19 pandemic has led to various uncertainties and fluctuations in financial and stock exchange markets, yet existing literature primarily concentrates on individual product rates rather than combined rate changes. Our study aims to bridge this research gap by analyzing the relationship between oil rates, silver rates, oil rate transitions, and silver rate transitions on the security exchange in China from 1990 to 2022, using the ARDL approach and Nonlinear ARDL for a comprehensive assessment. The findings reveal a significant impact of silver and oil rates on China's security exchange in the future, with the negative effects of oil rate changes and a positive effect of silver rate transitions. In the short term, oil and silver rates play a crucial role in influencing China's security exchange, highlighting the importance of monitoring these trends for investors. It is recommended that investors respond prudently to market transitions, particularly by considering silver as a secure option during times of uncertainty, while policymakers should implement appropriate measures to manage the rapid fluctuations from oil to the security market.",2024-07-01,
A Suggested Medium-Term Fiscal Framework for Guyana,"Guyana is growing rapidly, and fiscal policy plays a critical role in ensuring that the country's wealth is managed effectively and equitably.Issues of long-term fiscal and debt sustainability, while not of pressing concern, remain important as oil is an exhaustible resource.Issues of possible overheating, absorptive and institutional capacity constraints, together with inflationary and real exchange rate pressures, are likely to remain priority concerns for fiscal policy.These considerations suggest adoption of a comprehensive fiscal policy framework that guides public spending decisions based on a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and updated public investment management (PIM) and public financial management (PFM) frameworks.The MTFF should be based on a medium-term fiscal anchor.Fiscal policy in resource rich developing countries (RRCs) usually has to balance several, and sometimes competing, policy objectives.In particular, fiscal policy has a crucial role to play in (i) promoting and maintaining macroeconomic stability, (ii) safeguarding the sustainability of public finances, (iii) ensuring an equitable intertemporal distribution of oil wealth across generations, and (iv) meeting the economy's physical infrastructure and human capital needs, while taking into account absorptive and institutional capacity constraints.Key fiscal policy challenges for Guyana over the near-and medium-term will likely have to focus on containing possible overheating / inflationary pressures, loss of competitiveness, and absorptive capacity constraints.With the help of oil revenues, first transferred to the budget in 2022, and debt financing the government has started investing heavily to address large development needs.As currently Guyana has one of the lowest public debt ratios in the world, under reasonable baseline scenarios public indebtedness and issues of fiscal or debt sustainability are not likely to be of major concern, in the absence of large and persistent negative shocks to oil prices or oil production.Stress tests carried out using the lowincome country debt sustainability framework (LIC-DSF) suggest that long-term fiscal and debt sustainability could come under risk only if there are adverse shocks to real GDP growth, exports, and/or commodity prices.However, accumulation of savings under Guyana's Sovereign Wealth Fund (the Natural Resources Fund, or NRF), are rising and could provide a substantial buffer against such shocks.Therefore, issues of overheating, absorptive and institutional capacity constraints, and 'Dutch disease' concerns through inflationary and real exchange rate pressures, are likely to be more pressing policy challenges over the short-and medium-term. 1 Expenditure growth rules can help with containing overheating pressures and capacity constraints.An expenditure growth rule is particularly desirable when scaling up public expenditures in the presence of absorption capacity constraints, and if the volatility of resource revenues requires precautionary savings.However, expenditure growth rules by themselves cannot ensure fiscal sustainability or intergenerational equity, and hence need to be accompanied by a suitable fiscal policy anchor.Such an 1 Dutch disease describes a situation where natural resource windfalls increase the demand for non-traded goods, which would then draw production factors away from non-resource-traded sectors and generate an appreciation of the real exchange rate, thereby eroding competitiveness of the non-resource sector.©International Monetary Fund.",2024-07-01,
Integration of the balanced scorecard and FAO SAFA for assessing the sustainability of horticultural production in Jawa Barat,"Abstract The agricultural sector is a vital component of Indonesia’s economy. However, agricultural production in Jawa Barat, particularly in horticulture, is facing various sustainability challenges. It is crucial to adopt a sustainable approach to agricultural production. This study aims to develop the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework to enhance the sustainability of horticultural production in Jawa Barat, using the FAO Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture (SAFA) Framework. A focus group discussion (FGD) was conducted with 68 horticultural farmers representing different regions and horticultural commodities in Jawa Barat. During the FGD, participants rated their familiarity with SAFA Framework indicators and assessed their importance. Frequency analysis was performed on the collected data to determine familiarity and importance levels and correlation analysis using the R method. This research reveals that indicators related to community investment, biodiversity, and renewable energy received lower recognition, suggesting a need for increased emphasis in these areas. The correlation analysis revealed a positive link between Finance and Customer dimensions, highlighting the importance of financial management for customer satisfaction. Addressing these findings will help enhance sustainability and bridge gaps in horticultural practices in Jawa Barat. The findings will support sustainable agricultural practices, enhance decision-making, and promote the long-term viability of the horticultural sector",2024-07-01,
Towards an era of multi-source uncertainty: A systematic and bibliometric analysis,"The frequent occurrence and diverse nature of black swan events in recent years, has stimulated explosive growth in studies on different types of uncertainties. We propose the concept of multi-source uncertainty (MU) and systematically synthesize 2230 high-quality articles (2000−2023) extracted from Web of Science via bibliometric analysis. With the help of performance analysis and science mapping analysis, we find that: (1) MU research has gone through three stages, preparation stage (2000–2007), rising stage (2008–2015) and take-off stage (2016–2023). (2) MU research is undertaken across a wide range of disciplines from Economics to Environmental Science, from Meteorology to Business Finance and from Computer Science to Political Science. (3) The intellectual structure of MU research consists of a methodological basis for the measurement of uncertainty and its effects and a theoretical basis for the impact of uncertainty on corporate finance, economic activity, and asset pricing. (4) Four major themes have been investigated by current literature, namely, ""Environmental uncertainty and adaptation"", ""Uncertainty nexus and commodity volatility forecasting"", ""The impact of uncertainty on corporate finance"", and ""The effects of uncertainty shocks on financial markets"". (5) The keywords at the three stages show a rapid growth trend, with more diversified sources of uncertainty and increasingly rich research topics. Among them, ""geopolitical risk"", ""volatility forecasting"", ""climate policy uncertainty"", ""economic policy uncertainty"", ""economic uncertainty"", and ""COVID-19"", are currently the hottest keywords. Overall, we present recent research trends, gaps, and future research agendas in this domain, which will help policy-makers, regulators and academic researchers know the nuts and bolts of the MU research, and identify the relevant areas that need investigation.",2024-06-30,
"The impact of the Russia–Ukraine war on stock prices, profits and perceptions in the food supply chain","Abstract The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 had profound consequences for the global economy. As both countries are major commodity exporters, the food value chain was also affected. This study investigates the impact of the invasion on stock prices, profitability and sentiments of agribusinesses along the food supply chain by using an event study, financial data, and a sentiment analysis of annual reports. Overall, the findings show that firms in the food value chain were negatively impacted, with regional and sector‐specific differences. Agribusiness firms in Europe and Japan were more negatively impacted by the war than those in the United States. Stock prices of Brewers, Packaged Food and Meats, Soft drinks, and Tobacco firms were negatively impacted by the invasion, while other sectors experienced no or little impact on stock prices. Fertilizers and Agrochemicals firms overall achieved a higher profitability in 2022 compared to previous years. [EconLit Citations: G01, G12, E44, Q01].",2024-06-30,
Perdagangan Internasional dan Pertumbuhan Ekonomi di Indonesia,"One of the most common topics concerning a country's economy is economic growth. Economic growth is significant in a country's economy since it represents a proportion of a country's economic development or success, yet it is undeniable that numerous efforts must be undertaken. Wijono said that economic growth is a marker of progress in improvement. Something that can be the main driver of progress is international trade. Products and imports constitute international trade, one part of which is the main driver of economic growth. Therefore, commodities and imports at the same time have an impact on Indonesia's financial development.",2024-06-30,
ANALISIS HUBUNGAN HARGA EMAS DAN PASAR SAHAM MENGGUNAKAN MIXED-COPULAS,"Gold is considered as a reliable investment tool for long-term savings and/or investment portfolios. Investors who do not like high risks trust gold to be a safe haven commodity that can mitigate the impact of any financial crisis. Gold and stocks are often used as substitutes for each other, where the two have an inverse relationship. Copula is used to capture the dependence relationship between world gold prices and the stock indexes. The data used are the stock index data for the JKSE Indonesia), PSE (Phillipines), Nikkei 225 (Japan), HSI (Hong Kong), and world gold prices (XAU) from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019. From the data, the ARMA-GARCH model is made to solve the problem of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. Then, the correlation between assets is calculated using the rank correlation. Furthermore, four pairs of data are made from each stock index with the price of gold. Next, the best copula and the estimated Value-at-Risk (VaR) are sought for each portfolio. From the results of the selecting of the best copula for each pair of data, it is found that gold can be a safe haven asset in the Hong Kong's stock market. The VaR results show that the biggest loss is in the Japanese market.",2024-06-30,
EXPLORING THE LINKAGES BETWEEN GREEN BONDS AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS: AN INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO PERSPECTIVE,"The aim of study is to examine the dynamic linkages between green bond &amp; international financial markets. In particular, the study investigates the inter-connections among green bonds, world’s developed and emerging equity markets, commodities market (gold &amp; oil) and the foreign exchange market. Sample period ranges from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2023 encircling numerous important events including COVID-19 pandemics. For empirical investigation, study used combination of several econometric techniques including Johansen Cointegration model and Granger Causality test and analysis for examining short &amp; for long-term associations among markets. Results of study show that these markets are linked in varying degrees in long-run as evident from cointegration results that show two cointegrating vectors. This infers that there are limited diversification benefits specially in long-run in selected markets. In short-run, results show diversification potential as showed by results from Granger Causality tests. Results have important implications for investors &amp; fund managers in making portfolio decisions, &amp; policy makers in devising various strategies for risk mitigation during turbulent periods.",2024-06-30,
"Forestry Extension Performance in Enhancing Forest Farmer Knowledge and Skills: A Case Study in Tompobulu, Maros Regency","Forestry Extension Workers, as one of the important parties in maintaining and preserving forest resources in Indonesia, are expected to have an understanding of good extension methods and techniques so that farmers around the forest can improve their knowledge and skills in managing and utilising forest products. This study aimed to assess the performance of forestry extension workers in Tompobulu District. And also evaluate their role in enhancing the knowledge and skills of forest farmer groups in Maros Regency. It was located in six villages, namely Bonto Somba Village, Bonto Manurung, Bonto Matinggi, Bonto Manai, Tompubulu, and Pucak Maros Regency with the number of samples in the study was 57. The study employed qualitative descriptive analysis using a Likert scale, and quantitative analysis using the t-test. The performance of forestry extension workers that significantly influences increasing the knowledge and skills of forest farmer groups consists of six indicator components, namely: facilitating forest farmer groups to prepare forest product utilisation maps; facilitating forest farmer groups to prepare annual work programs and plans; facilitating forest farmer group members to improve human resource quality; facilitating forest farmer groups to disseminate or spread information on forest product technology; facilitating forest farmer groups to grow their empowerment and independence; and facilitating forest farmer groups to increase production results of superior forest product commodities. Meanwhile, the performance of forestry extension workers that does not significantly influence increasing the knowledge and skills of forest farmer groups is Facilitating Business Partnerships Between Forest Farmer Groups, Entrepreneurs, and the Government, Facilitating Forest Farmer Groups to Access Business Capital with Financial Institutions, Banks, and the Government; and Facilitating Increasing the Income and Welfare of Forest Farmer Groups.",2024-06-30,
The Role of ASEAN's Rice Commodity Market Integration in Economic Stability and Food Security,"Food security is a crucial issue in economics, particularly for ASEAN countries that heavily rely on rice commodities. Climate change impacts rice production, leading to production declines and price spikes, threatening economic stability and social welfare. ASEAN has committed to strategic cooperation to protect rice supplies and prevent food crises, while increasing production and stabilizing supply through collaborative initiatives. This study employs qualitative methods and descriptive analysis in literature review to explore the implementation of ASEAN regional cooperation on rice commodities. Secondary data is utilized to understand the impact of rice commodities on food security in the ASEAN region. Through a descriptive analytical approach, this research aims to provide an accurate picture of the relationship between regional cooperation and rice commodity management in ASEAN. The results indicate that ASEAN rice market integration is vital to reduce price risks for farmers and improve food security. The establishment of a rice futures market can help manage risks and ensure stable prices, which are crucial for maintaining economic stability. Regional cooperation and harmonization of rice standards are necessary, along with improved infrastructure and financial support for farmers to sustain the agricultural sector and the economic well-being of the ASEAN region.",2024-06-30,
CHALLENGES OF BRIDE BUYING WOMEN (MOLKI) IN HARYANA,"Bride buying, a controversial practice prevalent in certain regions of India, particularly in Haryana, raises significant ethical and social concerns. This paper explores the challenges faced by women who are bought as brides, including social stigma, lack of autonomy, economic dependence, and psychological issues. By examining the cultural and socio-economic context of Haryana, this paper aims to highlight the challenges faced by women purchased for marriage purpose and to understand the impact on the society at large. In the end, some suggestions are also given to provide better living for purchased brides. Bride buying, a practice rooted in socio-economic and cultural complexities, has significant implications for women in Haryana, India. This study explores the multifaceted challenges faced by women who become brides through this transactional system. Central to these challenges are issues of autonomy and agency, as many women are treated as commodities rather than individuals with rights and desires. Economic burdens placed on families often lead to financial exploitation, further ingrained poverty and limiting educational and career opportunities for these women. Additionally, the psychological impacts of bride buying, including feelings of worthlessness and depression, are profound, as societal norms perpetuate stigma and isolation. Legal frameworks aimed at addressing dowry-related practices often fall short, leaving women vulnerable and unprotected. This paper underscores the urgent need for inclusive policy interventions and community awareness programs not only to encounter the challenge of bride buying in Haryana but also promote gender equality and empower women in Haryana.",2024-06-30,
Implementing Islamic Banking in Uzbekistan,"Purpose: This research investigates how to implement the Islamic banking system in Uzbekistan. It explores the need, size of the potential demand and supply of Sharīʿah-compliant products and services. The study also identifies opportunities and challenges of implementing Islamic banking in Uzbekistan and provides insight into how to overcome those challenges. This paper aims to fill the gap and answer the following questions: why is there a need to introduce an Islamic banking system in Uzbekistan? Research Methodology: Exploratory research was conducted to explore the opportunities and challenges of implementing Islamic banking instruments in Uzbekistan. It relies on mixed methods and a combined approach. Empirical data was collected from 400 members of the public and 45 professionals in the capital of Uzbekistan-Tashkent. The questionnaire was distributed randomly to adult residents using a survey and structured interviews based on the fieldwork carried out in Tashkent. Data were analysed using statistical methods. Findings: This research reveals novel findings and results indicate that the potential demand exists as demonstrated by the samples. This research recommends Uzbekistan government revise the following: existing legislation, Central Bank rules and regulations, Tax Code, Civil Code, Law on Commodities, prudent Regulatory Framework for Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI), and human capital need to be developed. The country can cooperate with the Islamic Development Bank Group and other foreign organizations to achieve these tasks. Practical implications: The implications of this research are to provide a road map to the regulators, policymakers, governments, and the financial industry on how to introduce Islamic banking and finance in Uzbekistan. A likely remedy is the incorporation of Islamic financial instrument principles through the equitization of mortgages. As far as the author's knowledge this is the first research assessing the markets for Islamic banking in Uzbekistan. Originality/Value: This research complements the existing literature on why there is a need to implement Islamic banking in Uzbekistan and it contributes towards filling the gap as no empirical research exists.

Contagion and interdependencies between BRICS-plus Countries on the Markets of Commodities and Derivative Financial Instruments,"Purpose: This study was started on the main macroeconomic data (2010-2019), coming from the countries of the BRICS-plus group. While a significant contribution of these emerging economies to global economic output has generally been observed, this has also been accompanied by persistent domestic imbalance. Design/Methodology/Approach: Regarding the model, we state and contextualize the (long-term) risk co-incidence of the set of macroeconomic variables for this coalition of countries. Particular attention was paid to a valuation, description and forecasting model based on the calculation of the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) in a Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) process on the time series of credit default swaps (CDS). Findings: The empirical analysis and calculations carried out have verified the significance of the parameters and confirmed the conditional dynamic correlation between the economies of the Brics “expanded”, especially in the presence of shocks, which also involve mutual contagion (temporary increase in DCC) and even interdependence (increasing DCC leads to new, less unstable levels). Implications/Originality/Value: The research offers a look at the most current trends in terms of international economic balances and the entire global system, focusing on commodity markets, financial derivatives and the impacts of trade at the dawn of the new BRICS-plus coalition.",2024-06-30,
Impact of the Sex Work in the Phenomenon of Human Trafficking,"In modern Europe there is still an obstacle to achieving equality between men and women that turns the human body and human relationships into a commodity. The phenomenon of sex industry affects such as increase of human trafficking, violence and discrimination against women. Most often, victims of sexual exploitation in Europe are the less protected segments of the population: women, children, economically disadvantaged people, refugees an even usual migrants without sufficient experience of living in the new country. Average users of sex industry are men and sexual exploitation is the result of their demand and financial support in the form in which it is now. Traffickers, pimps and just people who involve women in prostitution make huge money, sacrificing the lives and the health of people in difficult situations. Legalisation of prostitution leads to greater demand. For people in poor or precarious economic circumstances it is the way to find “quick money” to survive or avoid intolerable living conditions. They pay for that with their mental and physical health, they are subjected to violence and various violations of rights, they are under control and exploitation, they can be isolated and intimidated.",2024-06-30,
Connectivity among the returns of sectoral indices of the Brazilian capital market,"Purpose As specific objectives, we intend to: (1) measure the connectivity between the spillovers of returns from the financial and nonfinancial sectors of the Brazilian stock market; (2) estimate the spillovers of individual returns for each sector to identify periods of higher and lower profits over a period of around eight years; (3) investigate the existence of relationships between these repercussions between pairs of sectoral indices, evaluating how much each specific sector transfers to each other and the market as a whole and (4) examine whether the connectivity of the Brazilian stock market itself and future interest rates in the USA and Brazil as well as the risk of the Brazilian economy, were explanatory variables of the dynamics of interdependence in the returns of these indices. Design/methodology/approach With a daily series of closing prices of sectoral indices from March 3, 2015, until June 21, 2023, we researched eight of the most relevant sectoral indices on the São Paulo Stock Exchange (B3). With this data, we estimate the Diebold–Yilmaz spillover index and frequency decompositions of Barunik–Krehlik. Findings The conclusions indicate that there is an overall connection of 66% in the financial and nonfinancial sectoral indices, with a peak of 83%. The consumer, energy and public services sectors stand out as significant sources of primary spillovers. When we classified secondary effects into periods, we saw that the shocks dissipated as time passed and the returns of the commodity index remained resilient across all periods. Originality/value Our conclusions highlight the influence of three main factors in sectors with a high degree of connectivity: periods of increased uncertainty; negative externalities in post-crisis periods and the impact of financial news on market sentiment. We think this study provides information that can be useful for policymakers, investors, investment portfolio managers, economists (financial, monetary and industrial), investment consultants and researchers who are interested in the complex interconnection among emerging market stock indices.",2024-06-30,

FEATURES OF FOREIGN TRADE BETWEEN UKRAINE AND THE USA IN 2015-2023,"Objective. The objective of the present study is to analyze the state and identify the features of the development of foreign trade relations between Ukraine and the United States in 2015-2023. Methods. The following methods and techniques of cognition were used: analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction (to substantiate the importance and role of the United States in the development of Ukraine's foreign trade relations), analysis of series of dynamics (to identify trends and patterns of development, peculiarities of the dynamics of foreign trade relations between Ukraine and the United States), graphical (to visualise the peculiarities of the development of foreign trade relations between Ukraine and the United States). Results. Based on the study of the status and peculiarities of development of foreign trade relations between Ukraine and the USA in 2015-2023, the author establishes that despite the fact that the history of development of foreign trade relations between Ukraine and the USA dates back to 1992, during 1992-2023, more than 100 different agreements were concluded between Ukraine and the USA, during the period under analysis, the USA was not the main foreign trade partner of Ukraine - the share of trade with the USA accounted for an average of 7.5% of Ukraine's foreign trade turnover. It is proved that during 2015-2023, foreign trade relations between the countries steadily developed and deepened, which was reflected in the growth of the share of foreign trade between the countries in the total foreign trade of Ukraine by 6.4%. It is established that during 2015-2021, the lion's share of foreign trade turnover between the countries was formed by foreign trade in goods, but starting from 2022 - by foreign trade in services (in 2022, foreign trade in services accounted for 82.1% of foreign trade between Ukraine and the United States, in 2023 - 76.9%). It was determined that in 2015-2023: the rate of growth of the volume of foreign trade in services of Ukraine and the USA was almost 6.5 times higher than the rate of growth of the volume of foreign trade in goods, as of 2023, foreign trade in services significantly exceeded foreign trade in goods in terms of volume; the balance of foreign trade in goods was negative and constantly growing; the coefficient of coverage of imports by exports was characterized by a constant tendency to decrease; the main articles of Ukrainian commodity exports to the USA were products made of cast iron or steel, iron and steel, preparations made from vegetables, fruits, nuts or other parts of plants; imports - means of transport, except railway or tram rolling stock; mineral fuel, petroleum products and products of their distillation; machines and mechanical devices, boilers, nuclear reactors, their parts; the balance of foreign trade in services was both positive (in 2015-2021) and negative (in 2022-2023); the coefficient of coverage of imports by exports significantly decreased by almost 0.93 points; the main articles of Ukrainian export of services to the USA were: air transport services; construction; services related to financial activities; financial services paid directly; auxiliary services in the field of financial activity; services related to patent activity; services in the field of telecommunications, computer and information services; computer services; information services; scientific and technical services; imports of Ukrainian services from the USA were: state and governmental services; auxiliary services in the field of financial activity; services related to financial activities; trade-related services and brokerage services other royalties.",2024-06-30,
Impact of Currency Redesign and Cashless Policy on Household Standard of Living in Sokoto Metropolis,"This study investigates the impact of currency redesign and cashless policy implementation on household standard of living in Sokoto Metropolis using a survey dataset for a sample of three hundred and sixty-five (365) respondents. In the analysis, this study used Ordinary Least Squares regression and the results reveal that currency redesign has significant negative effect on household standard of living while the cashless policy has had a positive and significant effect on household living standards. Additionally, broader economic and environmental conditions, such as political instability, transportation costs, climate change, and rising commodity prices, have also played a significant role in shaping household welfare. However, the adverse effects of currency redesign highlight the need for policymakers to carefully manage the implementation of such reforms to minimize disruptions to the economy. The findings suggest that the cashless policy has been effective in driving financial inclusion, reducing transaction costs, and creating economic opportunities for households. Moreover, the significant influence of macroeconomic and environmental factors underscores the importance of adopting a holistic approach to policymaking, addressing both financial sector developments and broader economic challenges. To build on the benefits of the cashless policy, the study recommends that policymakers focus on addressing implementation challenges, strengthening supporting infrastructure, and ensuring the transition is inclusive. Concurrently, efforts should be made to mitigate the negative impacts of currency redesign and other macroeconomic risks through appropriate policy interventions and coordination across relevant sectors. By adopting this comprehensive approach, Nigeria can maximize the potential of the cashless economy to drive sustainable economic development and improve the overall standard of living for its citizens.",2024-06-30,

The best healthcare (commodity) available (for purchase): provider-induced demand for obstetric ultrasonography among ethnic minority women in rural northern Vietnam,"Despite Vietnam's overall progress on maternal health indicators, marginalized ethnic minorities in remote areas face lower access to antenatal care and higher maternal mortality rates relative to the Kinh (majority ethnic group). Last year, we conducted fieldwork for 2 qualitative research projects that aimed to address maternal health inequities among pregnant ethnic minority women in rural Northern Vietnam. Although not the focus of our research, the use of ultrasonography services at for-profit private clinics was ubiquitous in participants' healthcare-seeking accounts. Ultrasound scans from for-profit clinics were a major component of ethnic minority women's antenatal care: many purchased 8 to 10 scans during pregnancy at $6.15 US dollars per scan, despite their limited agricultural income of $120 to $205 per month. Women were unaware of how many scans were recommended and their medically indicated scheduling, but purchased frequent scans to assuage pregnancy anxieties and access what they experienced as the highest-quality antenatal service. In tandem, for-profit ultrasonography providers offered broader opening hours, immediate results, and rich technological scans, which seemed to deliver poor families the most tangible ""value"" for their hard-earned money. Previous literature documented the concerning overuse of ultrasonography among Kinh women in urban Vietnam: What are the implications of this trend extending to affect rural-dwelling ethnic minority women who face lower education, economic marginalization, and a 4-fold higher maternal mortality rate? Our findings raise concerns related to safety, financial vulnerability and provider-induced demand, and broader health policy questions regarding healthcare commodities in low-resource settings. Critically, there is no evidence of the effect of obstetrical ultrasound on reducing maternal mortality in low- and middle-income countries, and its excess use could burden available resources and detract from evidence-based services. Our findings suggest that health system gaps are driving poor women toward frequent purchases of a single insufficient maternal health commodity: this will not improve their pregnancy outcomes or health equity for marginalized ethnic minorities. We argue that addressing this overuse of ultrasonography due to provider-induced demand requires a multipronged response that meets women's growing expectations. Our findings highlight the need for investment in health education, health promotion, and reliable high-quality public maternal healthcare for ethnic minority communities in Vietnam.",2024-06-29,
Technological Innovation of the Crypto-Asset Financial Sector in Indonesia after Law Number 4 of 2023 Concerning the Development and Strengthening of the Financial Sector,"Law Number 4 of 2023 on the Development and Strengthening of the Financial Sector (UUP2SK) has provided changes to all regulatory and supervisory authorities over the operationalisation of cryptocurrencies, which were previously in the hands of the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti) to the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Authority (OJK). After the enactment of UUP2SK, the authority to regulate and supervise crypto assets is now under the purview of OJK, with the transition of taking over all responsibilities related to crypto assets, but there is no regulation that regulates in detail the procedures for the transfer of authority",2024-06-29,
Mean Absolute Directional Loss as a new loss function for machine learning problems in algorithmic investment strategies,"This paper investigates the issue of an adequate loss function in the optimization of machine learning models used in the forecasting of financial time series for the purpose of algorithmic investment strategies (AIS) construction. We propose the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL) function, solving important problems of classical forecast error functions in extracting information from forecasts to create efficient buy/sell signals in algorithmic investment strategies. MADL places appropriate emphasis not only on the quality of the point forecast but also on its impact on the rate of achievement by the investment system based on it. The introduction and detailed description of the theoretical properties of this new MADL loss function are our main contributions to the literature. In the empirical part of the study, based on the data from two different asset classes (cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and commodities: Crude Oil), we show that our new loss function enables us to select better hyperparameters for the LSTM model and obtain more efficient investment strategies, with regard to risk-adjusted return metrics on the out-of-sample data.",2024-06-28,
The basics of creating IT-project management software and monitoring the solvency of bank clients.,"The article is devoted to the study of the main stages of software product development, in particular, the creation of a demo version of the application. This demo version helps to determine whether there is a need for an application aimed at assessing the solvency of bank customers, and also helps to understand what functions are important to users. It also covers the principles of creating a software product that not only works but also meets market requirements. This is achieved by using the market interest testing method, which allows determining whether there is a demand for a particular product or service. Considerable attention is paid to the general grounds for the emergence of credit relations, which arise from commodity production, where the key element of credit functioning is the circulation of value within the commodity exchange. In this process, there is a time gap between the circulation of goods and their monetary equivalent, which leads to the separation of the monetary form of value from the commodity form. However, the turnover of goods is not the only reason for the emergence of credit relations. Nowadays, credit relations arise in any economic or financial transaction related to the debt of one of the parties to such a transaction. The article highlights the importance of user feedback and its impact on the further development of the application. It also emphasizes the need for continuous improvement and adaptation of the product to changing market conditions and user requirements. In particular, the importance of using analytical tools to track user behavior and feedback is discussed, which allows for timely product adjustments. The issues related to the effective management of IT projects, both traditional and flexible methodologies, approaches and techniques used to manage IT projects are considered. The author proposes to use the Scrum method for IT project management and provides recommendations for the effective implementation of IT projects. When bringing an IT product to the market, there are not yet sufficient grounds to conclude that the project is successful, as issues such as the mechanism for selling the product, the level of customer satisfaction, and the need for changes remain unresolved. In addition, the success of an IT project to create a new product cannot be determined by successful implementation alone - it is important to ensure the integrated operation of the developed IT system. Therefore, the success of an IT project is measured not only by its successful implementation but also by the efficiency of its operation, as well as by the product's ability to meet customer needs and bring profit to the company. In addition, it is important to consider that the success of a project depends on many factors, including market conditions, competition, customer needs, etc. Thus, the article provides valuable guidance and recommendations for developing software products that meet market needs and user requirements.",2024-06-28,
The Influence of Production Costs and Sales Volume on Company Profits at PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia (Case Study on the Indonesian Stock Exchange 2015-2022),"In 2019, production costs decreased by IDR 1,858,167. The decrease in production costs is because the company has to pay Holcim's debt, whose total debt reaches 9 trillion, so this year production costs have decreased. The lowest sales volume occurred in 2017. In 2017, the company's sales volume was only IDR 2,158,795. The decline in sales volume was caused by falling production costs and high inflation which also caused an increase in commodity prices. The lowest net income occurred in 2017. In 2017, the company still experienced a financial year loss (863,644) rupees. The decrease in operating profit was caused by a decrease in sales figures and a relatively large increase in financial costs",2024-06-28,
Bursa Suq Al Sila Framework Analysis,"In Malaysia, Tawarruq was introduced in Islamic financial system to replace the bai ai-inah concept. Hence, Tawarruq is the most popular product in Islamic Banking and finance sector. The ideas of Tawarruq came from the classical perspectives of jurists that want to assist the development of Islamic economic, banking and finance and replacing the old concept which is clearly prohibited in Islam. Therefore, to overcome this issues and facilitate the implementation of Tawarruq, Suq al-Sila’ (BSAS) was introduce in Islamic financial system. However, many scholars has discussed from a difference views about the implementation of Tawarruq and BSAS. This study refer to BSAS as a case study to complete this research. The objectives of this study is to understand the framework of BSAS, explain the types of commodities and specification of commodity authorizing by Bursa Malaysia Islamic Services (BMIS), participants in the BSAS platform and analyze issues that exist on the BSAS platform. Meanwhile, this research use the secondary data such as collect data from the sources from library and data from internet and primary data by interviewing Vice President, Bank Shariah Officer and Shariah Officer Hong Leong Islamic Bank to obtain primary data. This paper will explain in more detail the BSAS transaction flow and present the Shariah issues involved. The results of this study found that there are several aspects of the implementation of the BSAS platform that raise some Shariah issues. Therefore, this paper is expected to improve BSAS platform and Tawarruq principles.",2024-06-28,
Transformation of Forms of Money in the Era of Digitalization,"Introduction. The purpose of the article is to develop the doctrine about forms of money, to justify the need to develop new approaches to their delimitation in the era of digitalization. Theoretical Basis. Methods. Doctrinal sources provided the theoretical basis for this article devoted to the study of forms of money from the standpoint of law and econo­mics. The system approach required the analysis of scientific papers on the theory of state and law, as well as philosophy. To achieve this goal, various methods of understanding financial and legal reality were used, namely: dialectical-materialistic, logical, comparative, systemic, formal-legal, methods of analysis and synthesis, interpretation of law, which made it possible to analyze the prevailing scientific ideas about the forms of money, recognize money as a historically variable category, propose a new classification of forms of money, built taking into account the significant impact of digitalization on the organization of money circulation in the state. Results. Forms of money are subject to evolutionary development due to significant changes in the nature of production forces and production relations. Digitalization has contributed to the emergence of a new form of money – digital. Discussion and Conclusion. Money is a historically volatile category. Almost any kind of material and intangible property can act as such, subject to their official recognition by society and the state. It is proposed to distinguish between such forms of money as: material and intangible; commodity, cash (coins and banknotes), conditional (records of cash balances – non-cash, electronic) and digital (digital code).",2024-06-27,
Drivers of bushmeat consumption and perception of zoonotic disease risks in a Nigerian wet market,"Bushmeat trade has been documented as one of the causes of wildlife depletion and population decline and it is also implicated in the transmission of zoonotic diseases. This study investigated the factors influencing bushmeat trade and the perception of zoonotic disease transmission among vendors and buyers of the commodity at the Oluwo Market, Epe, Lagos, Nigeria. Data was collected using 150 structured interviewer-administered questionnaires through the KoboCollect survey tool between February and October 2022. Results revealed that the top three bushmeat sought after were Grasscutter (Thryonomys swinderianus), Pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis) and Antelopes. There was no significant association between household income and bushmeat consumption pattern (p&gt;0.05), rather non-financial factors namely taste, aroma and cultural customs were the main drivers of bushmeat consumption. Most occasional consumers (67%) would choose cheaper alternative protein sources over bushmeat. However, price increase will not deter purchasing in both groups. The lack of knowledge regarding disease transmission through contact and consumption of bushmeat was high among sellers (79%) and buyers (47%). The use of hand protection like gloves was uncommon when handling animals. Establishing safety standards among buyers and sellers is urgently needed, along with public health education to address zoonotic diseases risks.",2024-06-27,
Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy in Commodity and Financial Markets: Insights from GARCH and SVR Models,"The aim of this study is to enhance the understanding of volatility dynamics in commodity returns, such as gold and cocoa, as well as the financial market index S&amp;P500. It provides a comprehensive overview of each model’s efficacy in capturing volatility clustering, asymmetry, and long-term memory effects in asset returns. By employing models like sGARCH, eGARCH, gjrGARCH, and FIGARCH, the research offers a nuanced understanding of volatility evolution and its impact on asset returns. Using the Skewed Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) in model optimization shows how important it is to understand asymmetry and fat-tailedness in return distributions, which are common in financial data. Key findings include the sGARCH model being the preferred choice for Gold Futures due to its lower AIC value and favorable parameter estimates, indicating significant volatility clustering and a slight positive skewness in return distribution. For Cocoa Futures, the FIGARCH model demonstrates superior performance in capturing long memory effects, as evidenced by its higher log-likelihood value and lower AIC value. For the S&amp;P500 Index, the eGARCH model stands out for its ability to capture asymmetry in volatility responses, showing superior performance in both log-likelihood and AIC values. Overall, identifying superior modeling approaches like the FIGARCH model for long memory effects can enhance risk management strategies by providing more accurate estimates of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). Additionally, the out-of-sample evaluation reveals that Support Vector Regression (SVR) outperforms traditional GARCH models for short-term forecasting horizons, indicating its potential as an alternative forecasting tool in financial markets. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate modeling techniques tailored to specific asset classes and forecasting horizons. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of advanced techniques like SVR in enhancing forecasting accuracy, thus offering valuable implications for portfolio management and risk assessment in financial markets.",2024-06-26,
Portfolio balance effect of the U.S. QE between commodities and financial assets in commodity-exporting countries,"This study analyses the portfolio balance channel of the U.S. quantitative easing (QE) by assessing the dynamic spillover effect between commodities and financial assets in commodity-exporting countries during QE. This study integrates the generalized spillover index initially proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) for the fractional integration VAR model. Then, we estimate the multivariate framework of the Westerlund and Narayan (2015) (WN)-based predictive model to quantify the effect of the portfolio balance channel on the net pairwise spillover index from the U.S. to other countries. Our results show: first, for bond yields, that Asian and Pacific bond yields are impacted by both commodity price indices returns and the U.S. bond yields across the sample periods. However, mixed evidence is found for both Latin America and Others; second, for equity, dynamic net return spillovers contribute mixed evidence across regional groups during QE. The diverse results are partly explained by the average percentage of commodity exports to total exports of the country and the degree of close interrelationship between countries. Additionally, dynamic return spillover analyses show that most foreign exchange returns are negative net spillovers during QE, supporting the behavior of ""commodity currencies."" Last, the WN-based predictability models show pronounced differences in predictability across the selected commodity-exporting countries.",2024-06-26,
Metals for the Energy Transition: Exploring Opportunities Amidst Supply-Demand Imbalance,"The demand for ‘energy transition’ metals is expected to surge in the coming years. Despite increasing investments in mining, there remains an inadequacy in meeting the supply-demand equilibrium. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon; for instance, mining ventures entail substantial capital investments, protracted lead times, and arduous permit acquisition processes. Furthermore, over the past decade, mining enterprises have focused on restoring their financial standings amidst low commodity prices, resulting in a prevailing sense of caution in decision-making throughout the remainder of the decade. Therefore, the sector is opening up new opportunities for fresh investors, innovative business models, and emerging players in anticipation of the forthcoming super-cycle. The energy transition brings with it unique challenges and opportunities. Projections indicate a rise in raw material prices, an abundance of potential projects globally, and a rapid growth in the demand for metals coupled with government backing to address energy security concerns. However, as long as investor confidence remains subdued, costs stay high, and the permitting process progresses slowly; it is difficult for mining companies to initiate further investments. This article delves into the role of metals and minerals in the energy transition, highlighting the material-intensive nature of the net-zero economy. It elucidates, drawing from a cash flow analysis spanning the past two decades, the persisting reluctance of mining companies to invest and the resultant potential threats to supply-demand dynamics. Moreover, it examines the emergence of new entrants in the mining industry, such as EV manufacturers, driven by the necessity to secure their supply chains. Other potential entrants, driven by other motivations, include oil and gas companies. Indeed, oil and gas (O&amp;G) companies seek diversification from their core business. The challenges associated with entering the mining industry stem from the limited synergies between the sectors, divergent stakeholders, and the trend of numerous oil majors diversifying into new energy sectors, culminating in a progressively intricate array of business models. However, integrating the two would establish a ‘natural resources entity’ able to facilitate investments in metals crucial for accelerating the transition.",2024-06-26,
«White Gold» of the Cold War. USSR Cotton Policy in the Assessments of the US State Department and CIA (50s — Early 60s of the 20th Century),"В центре исследования автора статья находится один из ""теневых"" аспектов ранних лет холодной войны и соревнования между Восточным и Западным блоками, который играл не менее важную роль во внешней политике, чем в экономических делах в период противостояния Востока и Запада. Именно хлопковое производство и его влияние оказались в центре пристального внимания Госдепартамента США и ЦРУ. Оба они отслеживали эволюцию подхода советского блока к «хлопковой теме» и, в частности, способность СССР решать «хлопковый вопрос» в своих экономических и внешнеполитических интересах. На протяжении всего десятилетия с начала 50-х и до начала 60-х годов американские дипломаты и эксперты разведки выражали уверенность в тесном переплетении советской внешней торговли и внешней политики. Благодаря аналитическим исследованиям и информации, полученной по дипломатическим каналам из открытых источников, а также по каналам разведки, отмечался поток финансовой поддержки, направляемой СССР в хлопковую промышленность, и делался вывод о «двояких» советских намерениях в решении «хлопковых дел». С одной стороны, как предполагали в Госдепе и ЦРУ, СССР фактически пытался заполнить пробел в своей собственной легкой промышленности и военных потребностях за счет увеличения производства хлопка. Помимо этого, Москве было также жизненно необходимо помогать своим восточноевропейским сателлитам хлопком. С другой стороны, принимая во внимание важность хлопка для менее развитых стран, где у СССР были свои интересы, советское руководство использовало хлопок как инструмент в «открытии» этих стран в интересах расширения советского влияния в них и одновременно для проникновения в западные развитые страны, а также на международные рынки. The author focuses on one of the overshadowed aspects of the early years of Cold War competition between the Eastern and the Western Blocs that played an important role in both foreign and economic affairs during that period of the East-West confrontation. It was the cotton production and its influence which came into the center of persistent observance in the US State Department and the CIA. Both U.S. agencies followed the evolution of the Soviet approach to the «cotton theme» and particularly the Soviet capacity to handle the «cotton question» in her economic and foreign policy interests. Through the whole decade since the early 50s until the early 60s American diplomats and intelligence experts expressed their confidence in the close interwoven character of the Soviet foreign trade and foreign policy. Through analytical research and with information received by diplomatic channels and open sources examinations the U.S. agencies noticed the flow of the financial support directed by the Soviets to the cotton industry and came to the conclusion of «double-edged» Soviet intentions in handling «cotton affairs». On the one hand, as they assumed, the USSR actually attempted to fill the gap in her own light industry and military needs by increasing production of the cotton., Moscow also needed to assist her East European satellites with cotton. On the other hand, Moscow took into consideration the importance of cotton to less developed countries, where the USSR had interests, Soviet leadership used the cotton commodity as a central tool in «opening» of those nations in the interests of expanding Soviet influence with the side effect of penetration to the Western developed countries and international markets.",2024-06-26,
The Impact of Unconventional Monetary Policy on China’s Economic and Financial Cycle: Application of a Structural Vector Autoregression Model Based on High-Frequency Data,"With the occurrence of the global financial crisis in 2008, the U.S. unconventional monetary policy affected the Chinese market. Based on a monthly data sample from 2008M1 to 2015M12, in this paper we identify U.S. and Chinese monetary policy shocks by using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model with multi-external instrumental variables along with principal component analysis (PCA) combined with high-frequency financial market data. The empirical results show that the unconventional monetary policies had a negative effect on China’s inflation and output due to the signal effect, and China’s stock and commodity markets increased in the short term. During the same period, China’s monetary policy had a greater impact on the domestic economy and financial markets. The conclusion of this paper provides a significant reference for relevant departments to make decisions amidst the new wave of unconventional U.S. monetary policies due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",2024-06-25,
Assessment of Prospects for the Development of the Transport and Logistics Complex of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania,"The purpose of this study is to identify the prospects for the development of the transport and logistics complex of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania. The article analyzes the state of the transport and logistics complex of North Ossetia-Alania, its potential and current problems. The main tasks of the development of the transport and logistics complex of the region, the tools for their solution are formulated. Particular attention was paid to the aspects of development due to the passage of the North-South International Transport Corridor (ITC) through the republic, as well as the effect of sanctions pressure with the start of a special military operation in Ukraine. For the study, the authors used system and situational approaches, modeling of socio-economic processes, and formal and logical analysis. The transport and logistics complex of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania is characterized by a low level of equipment, the provision of automated control systems, the technical and operational condition of the main facilities included in its structure. It is gradually transforming in accordance with the current requirements of current and strategic development and has a fairly large development potential that can have a significant impact on the economy of the North Ossetia-Alania, the North Caucasus Federal District, the South of Russia and the Russian Federation as a whole. This potential is determined, first of all, by the passage through the territory of the republic of the most economical automobile route connecting Russia with Transcaucasia, the countries of Southwest Asia and the Persian Gulf; the possibilities of developing this route by extending the existing branch of the North Caucasus Railway to the South Caucasus; as well as the border position of the North Ossetia-Alania, which in the future allows it to pass and process large commodity, material and financial flows between the north and the south on the platform of the «southern hub». Strategic prospects for the development of the transport and logistics complex of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania are determined, first of all, by the modernization of the already created transport and logistics base, in addition, by its addition to elements that meet the urgent socio-economic and political needs of the republic and the country as a whole and create a multiplier effect on the economy of North Ossetia and neighboring regions.",2024-06-25,
Response of commodity markets to global warming attention,"<title>Abstract</title> This study used the internet search index on the topic ‘global warming’ as a proxy for the level of public attention to global warming and empirically tested the shock of global warming attention to international commodity markets. The findings indicate that the returns, volatility, and uncertainty of the commodity markets exhibited high sensitivity to global warming attention. Moreover, the findings show that first, global warming attention positively shocked the returns, volatility, and uncertainty of the agricultural market. Second, global warming attention negatively shocked the returns of the fossil energy market but positively shocked the volatility and uncertainty of the fossil energy market. Third, it caused no significant shock to the livestock market. Fourth, it positively shocked the returns of the metal market but did not significantly shock the volatility and uncertainty of the metal market. Therefore, it is imperative for financial regulators and investors to be more aware of climate change attention and its heterogeneous shocks to different commodity markets to prevent and mitigate its adverse consequences.",2024-06-24,

Forecasting Ginger Harvest Yields: A Comparative Study of Double Exponential Smoothing and Long Short-Term Memory Models,"Ginger, a vital herbal commodity, experiences low yield rates, necessitating intensive cultivation and rigorous evaluation by farmers to ensure financial viability and alignment with market demands.This study was conducted to devise a harvest forecasting system that supports decision-making through minimal error rates by comparing double exponential smoothing (DES) and long short-term memory (LSTM) forecasting methods.The efficacy of these methods was assessed through a series of trials, analyzing data collected from 2015 to 2019, comprising 250 datasets.The evaluation focused on two primary metrics: the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Root MSE (RMSE), to determine the precision of forecast models.It was observed that the LSTM model outperformed the DES method, yielding a MAPE of 38.99% and an RMSE of 1244.85432, in contrast to the DES method which resulted in a MAPE of 43.49% and an RMSE of 12997.34261, at an alpha level of 0.4 and an optimal beta of 0.1.Given these findings, the LSTM model is recommended for the forecast of ginger yields due to its superior accuracy and lower standard error compared to the DES method.This comparative analysis underscores the importance of selecting appropriate forecasting models to enhance agricultural planning and productivity, particularly in crops with fluctuating yields such as ginger.",2024-06-22,
The Nexus of Crude Oil and Food Prices: Evidence of the Crude Oil Prices Influence on Food Insecurity Problem,"Food cost is a fundamental factor in reducing world hunger and minimizing the food insecurity problem. Agricultural commodities prices, especially grains, are determinants of food costs. Therefore, studying the behavior of commodity prices responsible for food security on the planet is essential for economic agents, especially for macroeconomic policy decision-makers. Food production and prices are related to energy prices, mainly through biofuels and fertilizers. Among energy sources, crude oil is one of the main ones in the world's energy matrix. Many studies on crude oil and food prices have been carried out relating energy and food or, more specifically, crude oil and agricultural commodity prices. This work examines the dynamic relationship between oil and grain commodity prices: rice, wheat, corn and soybeans. It also verifies the causality and cointegration between each grain and crude oil price return. Besides that, Autoregressive vector models were estimated to infer the impulse response function and the variance decomposition. The sample period corresponds to the interval between the two biggest crises of the century, the subprime financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic sanitary crisis. Thus, the data is not impacted by significant abnormal variations caused by these crises. The inferences show an interaction between crude oil prices practiced in the international market and food commodity prices.",2024-06-21,
Economic Globalization,"Economic globalization is a term generally used to encompass the wide variety of interrelationships, networks, and processes that integrate economies across and above nation-states. While there is much consternation in the popular press about globalization generally and economic globalization specifically that suggests that something new and never before seen is taking place, social scientists across a handful of decades offer a more tempered view, depicting a functionally integrated global economy as an historical thing that nonetheless transforms and develops over time. The rich literature that has developed on this topic draws the readers’ attention to particular historical times and processes that constitute the early formations of the global economy we know today, even as its size and scope has intensified in recent decades. In this vein, scholars have devoted much attention to specifying the key indicators of economic globalization including—to name just a few— trade, global commodity chains, foreign direct investment, and financialization. All of these processes are the means by which economies are globally interwoven through the production, distribution, and circulation of goods, information, money, culture, and people. A similar amount of scholarly attention has examined the outcomes of economic globalization, and how they vary for different actors. Here inequalities of resources and power are central focal points, including those within and among nations, between capital and labor, and within the world-system hierarchy. The impact of economic globalization on marginalized people and places, as demarcated by gender, race, migration status, and environmental locations, as well as on nation-states and their capacity to govern effectively, are also topics of much interest. Finally, scholars have examined the many important issues related to the governance and regulation of economic globalization, which as a set of processes is occurring at a higher level than the nation-state and includes an ever-shifting balance of power between a number of actors and institutional bodies. International organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, are examples of quasi-governmental organizational bodies, though of varied effectiveness, as are international financial institutions. Finally corporate regulation in the global economy remains scarce, although recently corporate social responsibility initiatives have begun to be investigated and evaluated as a type of self-regulation. Although economic globalization is nothing if not hotly contested subject matter, scholarly research provides an exciting conversation, mapped here through its origins, its contemporary state and constituent elements, its differential outcomes for various actors, and the problems and possibilities of its governance.",2024-06-20,
Innovative development of water transport enterprises as a branch of high-tech industry,"The article is devoted to the innovative development of enterprises of high-tech products on the example of water transport. Water transport refers to high-tech products and in this regard, its production has a rather complex production logistics (intellectual, supply, organizational, financial, information, personnel, innovation, etc.) [2-3]. In this regard, the search for promising directions in the development of high-tech products becomes particularly relevant and important: a real opportunity to implement research and innovation and investment projects, the implementation of which will bring enterprises of the high-tech industry for the production of water transport to leading positions not only in the national economy, but also in the world [4-6]. This determines the importance of monitoring research projects as a vector for the development of innovative production at two levels: product (high-tech products) and technological (innovative technologies) [7]. The innovative vector of development of enterprises of high-tech products allows the actual efficiency of high-tech production to be brought closer to full potential efficiency, other things being equal, production factors in a short time of the stage of research and scientific and technical development of the life cycle of products of shipbuilding products, which is given the main attention in the article [6-7]. At the same time, an innovative approach, introducing products into industrial circulation, naturally provides conditions for further scientific and technical (innovative) development of both the products themselves and technologies (in other words, early introduction of products ensures its early withdrawal: the speed of the wheel of economic efficiency of production activities). When the actual efficiency of the limit of the potential efficiency of technological production is reached, in accordance with the laws of synergy, there is a leap, an innovative transition to a new (next, subsequent) level of potential efficiency of production of high-tech products, which naturally puts forward new requirements of an innovative nature to production. Otherwise, production due to the (law) moral aging of industrial products is doomed to bankruptcy due to the so-called factor of technological flexibility of production (TG). Which (TG), if organizationally taken into account in the economic activities of enterprises as forecasting, planning and management (design and innovation management), forms (economically ensures) the sustainable functioning and development of enterprises of high-tech products in modern conditions (the wheel of economic efficiency of production activities is the human factor): in the market model of the state transformation of a product (product) into a commodity and contracting.",2024-06-20,
Economic Security in Sub-Saharan Africa: Possible Ways to Address New Challenges,"The observed decline in the level of Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) countries economic security is due to the increasing influence of both external factors (the rising volatility of global financial and commodity markets, changes in the policies of international economic organizations and a number of countries, etc.) and internal factors, largely related to their own socio-economic and, in some cases, political instability. This is manifested primarily in the insufficient food supply in the SSA countries as a consequence of the ongoing agricultural crisis. Possible ways to overcome this challenge are connected with the transformation of the agriculture sectors into productive, profitable, and reliable systems that will allow the SSA countries to reach and maintain food security. The agricultural policy aimed at this must take into account the specifics of the local crops and livestock production, the local climate, and the state of rural infrastructure, while making extensive use of new technologies and digital innovations. One of the most important factors for stable economic development is energy security in the context of the ongoing energy transition. The problematic state of energy supply in the SSA countries is manifested in the insufficient supply of electricity for both industrial sectors and the population, rolling blackouts, and rising tariffs. African countries see a solution to this challenge in implementing the strategy aimed at expanding national and regional networks based on the rational use of all available energy resources, creating off-grid systems and small-scale generation in remote areas using renewable energy sources, which will facilitate access to sustainable and technologically advanced energy. Further expansion of cooperation in almost all areas of the energy spectrum between African states and Russian public and private companies, as well as leading universities, will contribute to solving many problems of economic security in Sub-Saharan Africa.",2024-06-20,
Comparative Analysis of Deliverable and Non-Deliverable Contracts in the Hong Kong Trading Market - Taking RMB as an Example,"NDFs are over-the-counter traded foreign exchange derivative products. The settlement of an NDF contract does not involve the delivery of the underlying currency pair. Instead, it involves a net payment in a convertible currency (usually the US dollar), which is proportional to the difference between the agreed forward exchange rate and the subsequently realized spot fixing. Hong Kong's geopolitical location as an outlet that connects mainland China to the world gives it an essential role in researching CNY's international features Hong Kong's trading market serves as a crucial link for the expansion of RMB usage, with the resulting shifts in positions supporting the interpretation of the role of RMB in the process of globalization of the currency, as well as the interpretation of financial markets. This study examines how the Hong Kong market serves as a critical hub for the currency's global integration through its trading of RMB, and focuses on the interplay between market regulations, economic policies, and the intricate balance of supply and demand affecting deliverable (CNY and CNH) and non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts. The research findings reveal that the examination of transaction data from Hong Kong's commodity exchange demonstrates a complicated interconnection between deliverable (CNY and CNH) and non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts. This intricate relationship highlights the Chinese Yuan's (RMB) fluctuating role in the market, influenced by factors such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and economic conditions. In essence, the RMB's trading volumes and value in this setting reflect its sensitivity to both domestic and international market shifts.",2024-06-19,
Commodity Security: The Role of Drug Revolving Fund Scheme in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"The purpose of the study is to establish the role of Drug Revolving Fund (DRF) Scheme in achieving commodity security in LMICs. DRF scheme is a self-sustaining health financing strategy that charges “user fees” just enough to recover the cost of health commodities and aims to ensure that quality lifesaving health commodities are available, affordable, and accessible to all irrespective of one’s financial status, thereby contributing to achieving universal health coverage, especially through the primary health care system. The study, using a literature review approach, aimed to establish that commodity security can be realized through functional DRF scheme as a component of a sustainable health financing strategy in the face of foreign aid donor fatigue and dwindling government investment in public health care due to other competing demands. The study finds that a functional DRF scheme requires a strong political and financial commitment, robust management, and technical systems, and involves stakeholder and community participation, and use of operational guidelines and that going to scale are best achieved when done in a phased, and incremental manner. The contribution to knowledge of the study is that the DRF scheme is a feasible pathway to attaining commodity security without exerting enormous demands on already scarce resources of LMICs.",2024-06-19,
A review on value-added goodies from different major and minor fruits from the perspective of India,"Nutrition and health are gaining significant focus as people seek convenient, nutrient-rich food options. Food processing must be efficient, cost-effective, and durable to meet these demands. Transforming fruits into diverse products using affordable technology can boost the economy for farmers and the nation. Fruit-based goods with high potassium and low salt offer substantial dietary benefits, making them valuable to health-conscious consumers.The present study aimed to study different value-added products from fruits and to increase their shelf life. Perishable fruit has losses during postharvest changes. Different strategies are required to avoid such losses. One method is to transform fruits into value-added goods. The transition of a raw resource or commodity into a processed product by combining raw materials, labour, time, and technology to produce a higher financial return is known as value addition in fruit processing. It focuses on ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. Value-added fruit products can contribute to food security by achieving sustainable goals of good health and well-being. The study concluded that value-added fruit products play a vital role in the food industry, benefiting both producers and consumers. They reduce food waste, provide economic opportunities for farmers, and offer consumers convenient, nutritious, and flavourful options. The value-added fruit product market will likely further,contributing to the agricultural sector’s sustainability and worldwide consumer well being. This review details the value-added products in fruits.",2024-06-19,
Debt load as a fundamental factor of changes in the conditions of global economic development,"The relevance of the problems investigated in the article is determined by the fact that the world economy fragmentation worsens its dynamics, but its actual fragility became relevant after the global crisis of 2008–2009. In this regard, developing countries are increasingly characterized by extreme risks associated with the global markets’ instability – not only commodity markets, but also financial ones, where the innovative derivatives expansion has increased the speculators’ role, thereby making commodity markets more volatile. The overall situation is aggravated by debt problems in many countries. The purpose of the study is to investigate the nature and extent of the debt burden that has developed in the global economy in recent years and to assess the key challenges facing the monetary policies of countries around the world in order to counter the rising debt burden. The main results of the study include the assessment of the scale and nature of the debt burden in terms of its negative impact on global economic development, identification of the relationship between the business cycle passage and the debt accumulation in foreign countries, as well as the main directions of prospective monetary policy that will contribute to the debt burden reduction in the foreseeable future.",2024-06-17,
External Adjustment in Commodity Exporting Economies During Energy Price Downturns,Recent examples of energy price downturns did not alter trade surpluses in commodity exporting countries. Economic theory contends that such developments may indicate that the changes observed in energy prices are perceived as permanent by the market. We perform a trend-cycle decomposition of oil prices and find that permanent shocks account for about 90% of oil price variation. The observed variability of oil prices attributable to permanent shocks may be explained by the increased financialization of oil markets. This finding is in line with the empirical evidence that the current account surplus is generally unaffected by permanent terms-of-trade shocks.,2024-06-16,
Pengendalian Inflasi Dalam Penilaian Ekonomi Makro Islam Di Indonesia,"Inflation control is a very important aspect in macroeconomic assessments, including from an Islamic economic perspective. The main focus of this research examines the mechanisms and principles of controlling inflation within an Islamic macroeconomic framework, with a focus on monetary and fiscal policies that are in accordance with sharia. This approach emphasizes economic justice, fair distribution of wealth, and balance between supply and demand in the market. Instruments such as the prohibition of usury and the use of commodity-based currencies are discussed as potential tools to maintain price stability. Apart from that, this research also evaluates the role of Islamic financial institutions in promoting economic stability and reducing the rate of inflation. The research results show that the application of Islamic economic principles can provide an effective alternative solution to control inflation, while maintaining justice and the welfare of society as a whole. Through this analysis, it is hoped that it can contribute to the development of better and more sustainable economic policies in an Islamic context.",2024-06-16,
The War in Ukraine Impacting European Financial Market and Banking Sector,"The European financial landscape, characterised by interconnectedness and global market integration, plays a pivotal role in capital accumulation and regional growth.

A framework for generating explanations of machine learning models in Fintech industry,"Artificial Intelligence is making significant inroads into various aspects of business and life bringing the transformation in many ways. The convolution of technology in finance is often called FINTECH rapidly growing area of transformation. In the FINTECH industry, AI can automate several financial processes and services such as fraud detection, customer services, credit assessment, price predictions, customer churning, trading services, risk management, underwriting, market forecasting. These processes and services are critical to financial sectors such as banking, insurance, currency, stock and commodity markets, wealth management, payment clearing houses, payment regulators etc. Regulations control these processes and should be transparent in their operations. AI models are inherently opaque in their outcomes and unable to be fully plugged into the financial processes and services. Explainable AI is the key area of research that can help to provide transparency to enable these AI models as fully operational business models to automate financial products and services. In this paper we will broadly outline the framework of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in finance sectors and services. We then look into one use case of credit assessment and develop an XAI framework to provide transparent outcomes from the AI models.",2024-06-15,
Examining the Degree of Awareness Among Taxpayers Regarding the Tax System in the Context of Georgia,"<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""https://search.crossref.org/search/works?q=10.52340%2Feab.2024.16.01.12&from_ui=yes"">https://doi.org/10.52340/eab.2024.16.01.12</a> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The research titled ""Examining the Degree of Awareness Among Taxpayers Regarding the Tax System in the Context of Georgia"" explores the complex relationship between tax legislation, taxpayer awareness, and economic development. This study identifies a crucial junction in Georgia`s fiscal policy, emphasizing the need for an optimal balance between legislative reforms and taxpayer comprehension. Despite Georgia`s efforts to align its tax system with European standards, the research reveals a significant gap in taxpayer awareness, potentially hindering the success of reforms and broader economic development goals.<br />In the introduction, the pivotal role of the tax system in a country`s economic and financial infrastructure is highlighted. Georgia, in its pursuit of an attractive and favorable tax environment, has implemented tax reforms to simplify tax administration and harmonize legislation with EU standards. However, the study brings attention to the less effective implementation of these reforms, suggesting a potential lack of taxpayer knowledge as a contributing factor.<br />To assess taxpayer knowledge, the study employed a quantitative survey method, evaluating the level of knowledge among taxpayers and tax system employees regarding the norms and standards of tax legislation. The findings exposed a common thread of limited awareness about specific tax benefits, procedures, and recent legislative changes, indicating a need for targeted educational initiatives.<br />The concept of tax culture, encompassing awareness of legal economic conduct, obligations, risks, and benefits, is deemed vital for stable development. Despite existing information channels such as written/electronic forms, the efficiency of taxpayer education is considered low, as reflected in substantial fines imposed for non-compliance. The study suggests that raising tax culture entails enhancing knowledge about legal norms for both taxpayers and tax employees.<br />The study addresses the surge in detected violations, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive assessment of taxpayer and tax system employee knowledge. Recent reforms, including the introduction of personal tax advisors, advance rulings, and special tax regimes, aim to facilitate compliance. However, the study suggests that a significant portion of taxpayers remains unaware of these services and their potential advantages.<br />In terms of recommendations for improving taxpayer awareness, the study proposes strategic interventions, including a comprehensive overhaul of the tax communication strategy. Emphasis is placed on diversifying communication channels to cater to varied informational needs and preferences. Collaborative efforts with educational institutions and professional associations are recommended to develop targeted tax education programs, fostering a more knowledgeable and compliant taxpayer base.<br />The research, adopting a quantitative approach with a structured questionnaire, involved 87 randomly selected respondents spanning various professions. Most respondents exhibited diverse exposure to tax issues, including representation from economists, financial experts, lawyers, accountants, and professionals in fields such as management, psychology, and marketing. The study encompassed respondents from different sectors, including state (32.9%), private (35.3%), international organizations (27.1%), and self-employed/business owners (4.7%).<br />The questionnaire explored taxpayer awareness, covering topics like tax news, reforms, and information. Communication channels for obtaining information included the official website www.rs.ge (67.1%), Internet media (34.1%), and friends/colleagues (43.5%). Notably, SMS notifications from the Revenue Service had minimal utilization (1.2%). Respondents exhibited varying frequencies of seeking information, with 50.6% interested in specific issues, 18.8% daily, and 20% receiving information several times a month.<br />The study highlighted the introduction of the Unified Methodological Base (electronic search system) by the Revenue Service, aiming to provide constantly updated information. However, awareness about this platform was limited, with 67.1% indicating no information. Consultation with Revenue Service employees was common, with 65.9% confirming such interactions. Respondents described their professional relationships with Revenue Service employees as good (24), normal (10), satisfactory (11), and bad (5).<br />Examining taxpayer rights awareness, the majority (64.7%) were aware of their right to receive information from the tax authority, while 61.2% understood their right to tax benefits. Awareness of recovering overpaid tax/sanctions (55.3%), requesting tax audit information (42.4%), and submitting explanations during tax audits (36.5%) varied.<br />The study explored awareness regarding specific aspects of the tax system. While awareness was high for property tax (83.5%) and VAT payer identification (67.1%), gaps existed in areas such as circumstances exempting property declaration (62.4%) and property tax benefits (31.8%). Respondents exhibited diverse knowledge levels on various tax-related concepts, suggesting the need for targeted educational campaigns.<br />Questions regarding tax reforms demonstrated varying respondent awareness, with some citing specific changes like the Estonian model transition, VAT refund reform, and tax reform for international companies. Notably, 87.1% claimed not to have personally benefited from any tax relief.<br />In conclusion, the research provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities facing Georgia`s tax system. By adopting a multi-faceted approach to taxpayer education, grounded in strategic communication and collaborative partnerships, Georgia can enhance transparency, efficiency, and support for taxpayers. Such efforts not only benefit individuals and businesses but also contribute to broader economic stability and growth, reinforcing the essential link between informed taxpayer engagement and national prosperity. The recommendations emphasize the need for continuous communication, targeted education, and collaboration with relevant institutions to enhance taxpayer awareness. Recommendations include strengthening communication strategies, establishing regular channels for updates, collaborating with educational institutions, and implementing mechanisms for receiving taxpayer feedback. By implementing these suggestions, the Revenue Service can contribute to enhancing taxpayer awareness, fostering communication, and promoting mutual understanding between the tax system and taxpayers in Georgia. <p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>References:</strong> <p style=""text-align: left;"">• Bakhtadze L.

Identifying the Frequency and Connectivity Dynamics of the US Economy,"This paper seeks to investigate the connectivity of the US economy through the dynamics of the transmission of volatility in sectoral indices. For this, we use daily asset data and two methodologies. The first creates a spillover index that measures market connectivity and the second partitions this index into different frequency bands that denote periods. We found results that show significant transmissions of volatility among the 64 analyzed assets. Notably, the DJIA, Wilshire 5000, and S&amp;P 500 showed significant volatility and were the main drivers of volatility for the other sectors and indices. Results also indicated that sectors that transferred volatility were influenced by three key factors: periods of economic uncertainty, socioeconomic circumstances resulting from post-crisis events, and the impact of economic and financial news on market sentiment. Additionally, we found that global returns and price changes in market indices sent considerable volatility into commodity assets. Our results are potentially useful for investors, portfolio managers, financial economists, financial advisors, financial market regulators, and policymakers.",2024-06-12,
Real Time-Cutting Algorithmic Trading,"a. Brief overview of algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading, also known as algo trading or automated trading, refers to the use of computer algorithms and mathematical models to execute trading orders in financial markets. The primary goal of algorithmic trading is to achieve efficient and optimized execution of trading strategies, leveraging the speed and precision of computer systems. Here is a brief overview of algorithmic trading: 1. **Automation:** Algorithmic trading involves automating the process of buying or selling financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, currencies, or commodities. The trading decisions are based on predefined rules and algorithms, eliminating the need for manual intervention. 2. **Speed:** One of the key advantages of algorithmic trading is its ability to execute trades at extremely high speeds. Algorithms can analyze market conditions, make decisions, and execute trades in a fraction of a second, responding to market changes much faster than human traders. 3. **Quantitative Analysis:** Algorithmic trading relies heavily on quantitative analysis and statistical models. Traders develop algorithms that are based on mathematical formulas, historical price data, technical indicators, and other relevant factors to identify trading opportunities. 4. **Market Making:** Some algorithmic trading strategies are designed for market making, where traders provide liquidity to the market by quoting bid and ask prices. Market-making algorithms aim to profit from the spread between the buying and selling prices. 5. **Arbitrage:** Algorithmic trading is often employed for arbitrage strategies, which involve exploiting price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. These discrepancies may arise due to inefficiencies, delays in information dissemination, or other market imperfections. 6. **Risk Management:** Algo trading systems typically incorporate risk management measures to control exposure and mitigate potential losses. These measures may include setting stop-loss orders, position sizing algorithms, and other risk controls. 7. **Backtesting:** Before deploying algorithms in live markets, traders often perform extensive backtesting. This involves running historical market data through the algorithm to simulate how it would have performed in the past. This helps refine and optimize the algorithm for real-world conditions. 8. **Machine Learning:** Some advanced algorithmic trading strategies incorporate machine learning techniques to adapt and learn from changing market conditions. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. 9. **Regulatory Considerations:** Algorithmic trading is subject to various regulations to ensure fair and orderly markets. Regulatory bodies may impose rules regarding algorithmic trading practices, transparency, and risk management to prevent market manipulation and protect investors. Algorithmic trading has become increasingly prevalent in financial markets, with institutional investors, hedge funds, and proprietary trading firms utilizing sophisticated algorithms to execute trades efficiently and capitalize on market opportunities.",2024-06-12,
Mangalam Organics Limited: making camphor grow innovatively,"Learning outcomes The case study will provide an opportunity for students to identify the challenges a business-to-business (B2B) organization in a commodity product category faces in a growing environment. The students will learn to analyze and evaluate different strategies for growth and profitability. The students will be equipped to make decisions based on financial and nonfinancial data and the trade-offs therein. The case study will enable students to understand the application of the concept of operating leverage in different business conditions. Case overview/synopsis The leadership team at Mangalam Organics Limited (MOL) was worried about the company’s future in December 2021. The chief strategy officer (CSO), Akshay Dujodwala; the chairman, Kamal Dujodwala and the managing director, Pankaj Dujodwala had watched MOL go through many ups and downs. MOL manufactured camphor powder and supplied it to tableters [1], who would convert it into tablets, essentially used for Puja [2] purposes in India. Camphor was a white, waxy terpenoid with a strong aroma. It was mainly a commodity business with no pricing power when MOL supplied it in bulk to tableters. They had ventured into the business-to-customer (B2C) [3] space with their consumer brand “Mangalam” camphor tablets, positioned for religious uses in homes. However, this formed a very small percentage of their turnover. With thin margins and a low growth rate, it was difficult for MOL to sustain and grow, especially in the B2B [4] business. To make matters worse, their manufacturing unit caught fire in 2015, causing a major blow to their business. Under the leadership of their CSO, Akshay, they implemented strategies that helped the company bring down costs and wastage. Akshay helped MOL diversify further into the B2C market through their brands, “CamPure” for home care products and “Cam+” for health-care products. Huge expenditures on marketing and advertising were incurred to promote these brands. The COVID-19 pandemic watched the world go through a terrible phase with lockdown and rising health issues (both physical and mental). Camphor found an interesting place in immunity and religious purposes due to its aromatherapy properties and evoking feelings of relaxation. The newfound use helped MOL achieve an unexpectedly higher turnover. But Akshay knew that camphor, by itself, was fickle in providing profitability. To sustain growth post-COVID-19, MOL would urgently need to look for growth options. After giving it a lot of thought, he was faced with three options – he could either focus on CamPure as a B2C option, or concentrate completely on camphor powder and aroma as an existing B2B option or take the third option to go in for a first of its kind exclusive stores for all types of puja items called Pooja Sangam. While all these options had their own pros and cons, he had to now decide which was the best financially viable option for MOL as a way forward. Complexity academic level The case study is designed at the postgraduate level in an Master of Business Administration and executive education programs. Given the nature of the issues in the case study, it can be included in courses such as business strategy and strategic marketing.

Evolution of Payment System and Rises of Mobile Payment,"The evolution of payment systems highlights humanity's pursuit of efficiency, security, and convenience. Starting with barter systems, societies transitioned to commodity money like livestock and metals, eventually adopting metal coins around 600 BCE for their durability and divisibility. Paper money emerged in China during the Tang Dynasty, spreading to Europe as a lighter alternative. The Renaissance era saw banking institutions introduce bills of exchange and promissory notes. The 20th century brought charge and credit cards, followed by electronic payments with ATMs and digital cash. The 21st century has seen a rise in mobile payments, driven by smartphones and technologies like NFC and QR codes, with systems such as Google Wallet and Apple Pay. Mobile payments offer convenience, enhanced security, and promote financial inclusion, evidenced by initiatives like Kenya's M-Pesa. Future advancements in blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and AI promise to further transform the payment landscape, driving economic growth and improving the global financial ecosystem.

"Feasibility Analysis of Rumah Produksi Bersama (RPB) for Chili Commodities as Investment Promotion in Batubara Regency, North Sumatra","Chili is a strategic agricultural commodity that has high economic value and makes a real contribution to the national economy. The biggest problem in the chili trade system is price stabilization. Unstable prices occur when there is a change in supply volume. Based on BPS data in 2021, North Sumatra is the largest chili center outside Java with a contribution of 14.16%. Followed by West Sumatra and Aceh contributing 8.27% and 4.6% respectively. The center for red chili production in North Sumatra Province is Batu Bara Regency, which has an area of 982 ha with a productivity of 8 tons/hectare for red chilies, apart from Karo, Simalungun and Dairi. One way to overcome the chili problem in Batu Bara Regency is with the Rumah Produksi Bersama (RPB) program, which is a place for micro and small business actors to carry out joint production activities with similar product commodities, dependence on similar workforce skills, or the use of complementary technologies. Apart from that, RPB is a promotion for regional government investment in developing their region (Regional Branding) in addition to differentiating products and increasing value. For this reason, a Feasibility Study Method for the RPB KUKM for chili commodities in Batu Bara Regency, North Sumatra Province is needed, including through location, Production, Marketing, Financial and Management analysis as well as reviewing the regional image. Based on the results of the feasibility study, it was found that the location of the RPB is in chili, Lubuk Cuik Village, Limapuluh Pesisir District, Batu Bara Regency, North Sumatra Province, which is not far from the chili center in Batu Bara Regency. To achieve feasibility in accordance with the capabilities of RPB cutlery, it must be able to produce a minimum of 20 tons per month or around 240 tons per year with this production NPV, IRR and PP can be said to be feasible. Meanwhile, marketing is carried out B2B and B2C for potential offtakers, apart from building public-private partnerships and involving all key stakeholders, with the main player being the government.",2024-06-11,
Saving the Planet with Barbie?,"In 2019, Mattel introduced a series of Barbie dolls in connection with National Geographic which included a Polar Marine Biologist, an Entomologist, a Wildlife Photojournalist, and a mostly ""made from recycled ocean-bound plastic"" Barbie (""Mattel Launches Barbie Loves the Ocean"") followed in 2021. One year later, the company issued an ""Eco-Leadership Team"" composed of a Conservation Scientist, a Renewable Energy Engineer, Chief Sustainability Officer, and Environmental Advocate. This can be understood as an attempt to introduce children to the urgency of ecological issues and communicating to them the importance of research into climate change in an age-appropriate manner. Yet, despite the pedagogical opportunities the dolls might offer, I argue that their introduction and presentation primarily represents an instance of greenwashing, ""the act or practice of making a product, policy, activity, etc. appear to be more environmentally friendly or less environmentally damaging than it really is"" (Merriam-Webster). In order to support my thesis, I will analyse four issues: first, I will have a closer look at the way in which the four ""Eco-Leadership"" dolls express ecological concerns. I will then turn to the material Barbie is made of, plastic, and examine its environmental impact together with Mattel's ""The Future of Pink Is Green"" campaign. Next, I will discuss the conspicuous consumption Barbie models, focussing on the Malibu Dream House. I will address how this is entangled with settler colonialism in the fourth and final part. Eco-Leadership Barbie? The ""Eco-Leadership"" set, billed as ""2022 Career of the Year"" collection, consists of four dolls. They come in a cardboard box so that the toys are not immediately visible, and their accessories are stored in a paper bag inside. On the one hand, this makes the dolls less appealing, depriving the potential consumers of visual pleasure. On the other hand, this generates an element of suspense, much like a wrapped present. In keeping with Mattel's slogan ""The Future of Pink Is Green"", the colour pink is toned down, even though each doll sports at least one accessory in this colour. The toys are sold as a team, thus perhaps suggesting that ""eco-leadership"" is a collaborative project, which departs from the emphasis on individualism otherwise suggested by Barbie packaging. In their promotional material, Mattel mentions that all of the professional fields the dolls represent are male-dominated (""Barbie Eco-Leadership Team""). The combination of the careers featured makes a telling statement about Mattel's framing of ecological issues. First, there is a Conservation Scientist with binoculars and a notebook, implying that she is undertaking research on larger animals, presumably endangered species. Such a focus on mammals tends to downplay structural issues and the ""slow violence"" that affects ecological systems, as Arno Hölzer has argued (65). She is joined by a Renewable Energy Engineer with a solar panel, referencing the least controversial form of ""green energy"". Significantly, this is the classic blond Barbie. Together, these two dolls suggest that science and technology will find solutions to current ecological crises, global warming, et cetera (not that such issues are explicitly mentioned). The third doll is advertised as Chief Sustainability Officer. ""She works with a company or organization to make sure their actions and products are economically, environmentally and socially sustainable"", as Mattel puts it (""Barbie Eco-Leadership Team""). Here, businesses are portrayed not as the source of environmental pollution, but as part of the solution to the problem. While this is not entirely false, this particular approach to environmental issues is severely limited, firmly remaining within a neoliberal, capitalist ideology. It reflects what Dan Brockington and Rosaleen Duffy, following Sklair, term ""mainstream conservation"", which ""proposes resolutions to environmental problems that hinge on heightened commodity production and consumption"" (4). In this context, a company's promotion of ""ethical consumption"" ""achieves its ethically positive results by not counting various aspects of the production and consumption of its commodities"" (9). Finally, there's the Environmental Advocate – not activist (the term was probably too controversial). She is always mentioned last. Her poster reads: ""Barbie loves the earth"", possibly the most inane ecological slogan ever devised. It is made of plastic. Acquainting children with ecological issues in an age-appropriate manner is an important task. Playing environmental advocate, or scientist, might certainly be more educational in terms of ecological issues than many of the other career options the ""I can be anything"" series features. But the absence of a politician in the set, for instance, speaks volumes. The ""recipe"" for sustainability the dolls embody only requires a heavy dose of science and technology, whipped up by well-meaning entrepreneurship, with a little love for the planet sprinkled on top. One gets a prettier picture if one looks at the toys from different perspectives. The group is rather diverse, with a Black Conservation Scientist, an Environmental Advocate of Asian descent, and a Chief Sustainability Officer that might be Latinx, and ""curvy"". Again, though, there is a glaring omission. Indigenous people are not included, despite the fact that, due to environmental racism, they are among the communities most dramatically affected by environmental pollution. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., who coined the term ""environmental racism,"" defined it as racial discrimination in environmental policy-making, enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste disposal and the siting of polluting industries … , [and] the history of excluding people of color from the mainstream environmental groups, decision-making boards, commissions, and regulatory bodies. (Chavis 3) The consequences for Native Americans were and are severe. By 1999, Winona LaDuke notes, 317 reservations … [were] threatened by environmental hazards … . Reservations have been targeted as sites for 16 proposed nuclear waste dumps [and] [o]ver 100 … toxic waste [sites] … . There have been 1,000 atomic explosions on Western Shoshone land in Nevada, making the Western Shoshone the most bombed nation on earth. (LaDuke 2-3) The absence of an Indigenous doll in the Barbie ""Eco-Leadership Team"" is also noteworthy considering the long history of Native American and First Nations resistance to habitat destruction and environmental degradation, from nineteenth-century Lakota Little Thunder and Anishnaabe leader Wabunoquod (LaDuke 3, 5) to the #NoDAPL movement (Gilio-Whitaker 1-13). Following Robin Wall Kimmerer, one could even argue that sustainability, or ""beneficial relations between people and the environment"", are integral to Native (here: Potawatomi) culture (Kimmerer 6). On a very different note, any ecological consideration of Barbie dolls must also address their material properties. According to Mattel, the four dolls ""are made from recycled plastic … , wear clothing made from recycled fabric and are certified CarbonNeutral® products"" (""Barbie Eco-Leadership Team""). This does not apply to the heads and the hair, however – arguably the most distinctive parts of the toys. This had already been the case with the ""Barbie Loves the Ocean"" series (""Mattel Launches Barbie Loves the Ocean"") – apparently, this is not an issue that can easily be fixed. In other words, only some components of the dolls are manufactured from recycled plastic. Further, in 2022, over 175 different Barbie dolls circulated, of which at least 166 were not made from recycled plastic (Google). To speak of ""eco-leadership"" is thus rather misleading. To further examine this, I want to have a closer look at the materials the dolls consist of. Life in Plastic… For a while now, it has become common knowledge that ""life in plastic"" might not be so ""fantastic"" after all, Aqua's song notwithstanding. Plastic pollution of the oceans is a huge problem, killing birds, whales, and other seaborne animals; so are non-biodegradable plastic landfill, neo-colonial waste export, the detrimental health effects of phthalates in plastic, and so on (Moore, Freinkel). But what James Marriott and Mika Minio-Paluello call the uneven ""distribution of violence"" during the transformation of fossil fuel into plastic is less well known. Oil production and transport are frequently militarised, they show, with company interests taking precedence over human rights (173-74, 176). Heavily guarded pipelines cut through traditional grazing and farming areas, endangering people's livelihoods as well as local ecosystems (Marriott and Minio-Paluello 176, 178-79). To the consumers who buy the plastic produced from this oil, such violence is invisible, not least because production processes and their environmental consequences are actively screened from view by fossil fuel companies and local governments (173-74). ""Although these social and environmental impacts are inherent within its constitution, the plastic product in its uniformity is seemingly wiped clean of all that violence and disruption"", the authors conclude (181). Where these matters have rarely been discussed in academic research on Barbie, they garnered significant public interest around the time the movie was released in 2023. That the film itself received the Environmental Media Association (EMA) gold seal (Plastic Pollution Coalition) did not lay such concerns to rest. ""After the movie frenzy fades, how do we avoid tonnes of Barbie dolls going to landfill?"", Alan Pears asked in The Conversation. Waste Online highlighted the ""Not-So-Pretty Side of Plastic Toys"", Tatler headlined ""How Barbie is making climate change worse"", and in Medium, Eric Young even aimed to show ""How To Save The World from the Toxicity of Barbie!"" (with an exclamation rather than a question mark). Based on a 2022 study by Sarah Levesque, Madeline Robertson, and Christie Klimas, Pears noted that ""every 182 gram doll caused about 660 grams of carbon emissions, including plastic production, manufacture and transport"" (Pears 2). According to Duke Ines, CEO of Lonely Whale, a campaign devoted to protecting the oceans, ""80% of all toys end up in a landfill, incinerators, or the ocean"" (Mendez 3). Discarded toys make up around 6% of all plastic in landfills (Levesque et al. 777). There are estimates that, by 2030, in the US emissions from plastic production will supersede those from coal (Pears 2). Mattel seems to have recognised the problem. In 2021, the company announced its ""The Future of Pink Is Green"" campaign as part of its ""goal to use 100% recycled, recyclable or bio-based plastic materials and packaging by 2030"" (""Mattel Launches"" 2). The efforts include educational vlogger episodes and Mattel PlayBack, a toy return program aimed at recycling materials in toy production. With Barbie, this is difficult, though. As Dorothea Ruffin and others have noted, the dolls are composed of different kinds of plastics. The heads consist of hard vinyl, with water-based spray paint used for the eyes; the torso is manufactured from ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene-styrene), the arms of EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate), and the legs of polypropylene and PVC (polyvinyl chloride) (Ruffin 2). This makes recycling difficult, perhaps even unfeasible. So in effect, I agree with environmental educator Kristy Drutman that Mattel's eco-friendly self-presentation currently qualifies as greenwashing (Mendez 2). With Lyon's and Maxwell's description of the practice as ""selective disclosure of positive information about a company's environmental or social performance, without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive corporate image"" (9) as reference point, it becomes clear that Mattel's strategy perfectly fits this pattern. Their recycling efforts concern only a small number of the Barbie dolls they produce, and even those are only partly fashioned from salvaged material. Both the release of the ""Eco-Leadership"" set and the ""The Future of Pink Is Green"" campaign seem designed primarily to bolster the company's reputation. Conspicuous Consumption and the Malibu Dream House A central component of the problem is the scale of plastic toy consumption, as Levesque et al. observe. Mattel sells around 60 million Barbies annually (Ruffin 2). This amounts to over one billion dolls since 1959 (ETX Daily UP 2). What the scientists call ""the overproduction and purchase of toys"" (Levesque et al. 791) testifies to the continued centrality of ""conspicuous consumption"", the demonstrative, wasteful squandering of resources which, as Thorstein Veblen already noted in 1899, signifies and produces social distinction (Veblen 53; cf. 43-72). As he argued, ""an unremitting demonstration of ability to pay"" (Veblen 54) was and is central for upholding not only one's social standing, but also one's self-esteem. This is at the core of Mattel's business model: stimulating repeated purchases by issuing and marketing ever-new, ""must-have"" dolls, clothing, and other accessories. These tend to normalise an upper-class lifestyle, as Barbie's sports car, horse, and dream house attest. The Malibu Dream House, part of the Barbie universe since 1962, plays a specific role in this context. It symbolises fun, conspicuous leisure, and glamour. With its spectacular beaches, its exclusiveness, and its proximity to Hollywood celebrity culture, Malibu represents the apex of social aspiration for many people. Houses are also sexy, as Marjorie Garber observes in Sex and Real Estate. ""Real estate today has become a form of yuppie pornography. … Buyers are entering the housing market with more celerity (and more salaciousness?) than they once entered the marriage market"" (Garber 3, 4). The prominence of the house in the Barbie movie is thus not incidental. Malibu is among the most expensive locations in the US. The median property value is US$4.25m. Due to its beachfront location, its ""iconic design"" and ""cultural value"", local brokerage Ruby Home estimated that ""the price of the doll's DreamHouse [could be] an eye-watering $10 million"" (McPherson). With the understatement typical of the profession, the author of the article writes: ""unsurprisingly, Barbie’s home would only be available to high-net-worth buyers"". This does more than reinforce classism. The richest segment of the global population also has an inordinately large carbon footprint and overall negative impact on climate change. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% produced 16% of global consumption emissions in 2019. The propagation of Malibu Dream House living thus does not exactly rhyme with ""eco- leadership"". Barbie and Settler Colonialism The wasteful, environmentally detrimental lifestyle of the very wealthy is part and parcel of US settler colonialism. Unlike other forms of colonialism, settler colonialism attempts to replace the Indigenous population. The term does not only signify a devastating past but names an ongoing process, since Native people have not in fact ""disappeared"". Lorenzo Veracini puts it succinctly: ""settler colonialism is not finished"" (Veracini 68-94). As Patrick Wolfe famously wrote, ""'settler-colonial state' is Australian [and US] society's primary structural characteristic rather than merely a statement about its origins… . Invasion is a structure not an event"" (163). Malibu is traditional Chumash territory. The name derives from the Ventureño Chumash word Humaliwo, meaning ""where the surf sounds loudly"" (Sampson). The Chumash were forcibly deprived of their land by the Spanish Mission system in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Deborah A. Miranda has movingly detailed the traumatic effects of this violence in her memoir Bad Indians. But the Chumash are not gone. In fact, the Wishtoyo Chumach Foundation, whose mission it is to ""protect and preserve the culture, history, and lifeways of Chumash and Indigenous peoples, and the environment everyone depends on"", runs Chumash Village, ""with a goal of raising awareness of Chumash people's historical relationship and dependence upon the natural environment as a maritime people"", right in Malibu (Wishtoyo Chumach Foundation). None of this is mentioned by Mattel or the Greta Gerwig movie, which does not only signal a missed opportunity to demonstrate ""eco-leadership"". Rather, such an omission is typical for settler colonial culture. In order to buttress their claim to the land, settlers try to write Indigenous people out of North American history through a strategy White Earth Ojibwe scholar Jean O'Brien has called ""firsting"", that is, claiming the European settlers were there first, they ""discovered"" something, etc. The opening of the movie is a classic example. To the voiceover of ""since the beginning of time – since the first little girl ever existed"", it shows not Native inhabitants, but European American children in vaguely historical, possibly nineteenth century settler clothing. At other points, Barbie's and Ken's cowboy outfits, their glaring whiteness, references to Davy Crockett and, as Stentor Danielson mentioned in their presentation on ""Barbieland's Fantasy Ecology: Terra Nullius on the Pink Beach"" at the conference ""'You Can Be Anything': Imagining and Interrogating Barbie in Popular Culture"", to the Black Hills aka Mount Rushmore, clearly mark them as settlers. J.M. Bacon has coined the term ""colonial ecological violence"" to reference the ways in which environmental degradation and settler colonialism are inextricably intertwined (59). Effectively combatting environmental pollution thus also requires addressing settler colonial economic, social, and cultural structures. As Dina Gilio-Whitaker has forcefully argued, the success of environmental justice movements in the US, especially vis-à-vis the fossil fuel industry, may depend on building coalitions with Indigenous activists. Some of the most promising examples actually come from California, where beaches have been protected from corporate development because sacred Native sites would have been negatively affected (148). ""It may well be that organizing around Native land rights holds the key to successfully transitioning from a fossil-fuel energy infrastructure to one based on sustainable energy"", Gilio-Whitaker concludes (149). ""Effective partnerships with allies in the environmental movement will provide the best defence for the collective well-being of the environment and future generations of all Americans, Native and non-Native alike"" (162). This is a far cry from any policy Mattel has so far advertised, not to mention implemented. Conclusion In different respects, the promise of ""Eco-Leadership"" Barbies rings hollow. Not only do they suggest an extremely limited understanding of environmental concerns and challenges, Mattel's breezy pronouncements are clearly at odds with its simultaneous boosting of conspicuous consumption, let alone the focus on financial profit generally characteristic for its managerial decisions. In light of the enormous environmental problems generated by the manufacturing and disposal of the dolls, the waste-intensive upper-class lifestyle Barbie outfits and accessories promote, and finally the de-thematising of capitalism and settler colonialism both in Mattel's Barbie discourses and the 2023 Barbie movie, the company's attempts to project an ecologically conscious image seem primarily designed to capitalise on an increasing awareness of ecological problems in Mattel's target audience, rather than constituting a serious reconsideration of its unsustainable corporate strategies.

Race and Orientalism in the History of Asian Barbies,"In 1981, Mattel introduced America’s first Asian Barbie as “Oriental Barbie”, described as “dainty and elegant … [in a] long, slender yellow dress”, with hair “pulled back to display her lovely face” (“Oriental Barbie”). Oriental Barbie is purportedly from Hong Kong, yet she is simultaneously marketed to represent the entire Orient in a homogenising, stigmatising manner that exemplifies Robert Park’s concept of the “racial uniform”. The back of Oriental Barbie’s box provides vague, generalising descriptions of “the Orient” that imply the purported superiority of the Occident: “in this part of the world, we eat rice with our meals rather than bread or potatoes. We use chopsticks for eating instead of knives and forks . … Chinese is a picture language … . Below are some examples for you to try” (“Dolls of the World Oriental”). Particularly with the invitation to “try” Chinese, Mattel invites consumers to participate in what Kevin Powell calls the “cultural safari”, a term that, broadly construed, suggests a “fascination with a facet of another’s culture” (Kasulis). Michael Kimmel notes that such fascination is safe precisely because “you can ‘take [the cultural experience] off’”. Although Mattel begins to produce ethnically specific Asian Barbies in 1982, Ann duCille remarks, “these quick-and-dirty ethnographies only enhance the extent to which these would-be multicultural dolls treat race and ethnic difference like collectibles, contributing more to commodity culture than to the intercultural awareness they claim to inspire” (“Dyes and dolls” 52-53). Because of this blatant cultural marginalisation of race and ethnicity that has been produced for years as a site of foreignness from within the predominantly cisgender, heterosexual, white United States and Barbie universe, I seek to explore how Mattel has perpetuated Orientalism through the production and marketing of Asian Barbies within their Dolls of the World series. The cultural marginalisation that Mattel creates through the marketing of Asian Barbies is accomplished under the pretense of increasing public knowledge and prompting intercultural awareness, which is stated on the back of Oriental Barbie’s box in a very literal interpretation of Powell’s cultural safari: “come visit the Orient. I know you will find it exotic and interesting”. The back of the box also contains a “miniature cultural history and language lessons” (duCille, “Black Barbie” 341) for the consumer to “try” with each doll from the Dolls of the World series. The particular “language lesson” featured with Oriental Barbie are Chinese characters that Mattel deems a fitting example of Chinese as a “picture language”. Interestingly enough, an exceedingly domestic overtone is at play with the selected characters: 媽 (mother), 爸 (father), 你 (“you”, but the masculine version of the pronoun), 房 (house), 玩 (play), 愛 (love), 喜 (joy), and 吃 (eat). The image of playing house and of a presumably heteronormative nuclear family seems to be strongly insinuated with this choice of characters. Furthermore, Mattel equates the Orient with “joy” by featuring the character 喜 (joy) alongside the word “Orient” on the front of the box. In observing the Oriental Barbie box, which states “Meet Barbie from Hong Kong” on the front and depicts the Hong Kong Dollar as “the Oriental currency” on the side, it is worth considering why Mattel chose Hong Kong as the home of Oriental Barbie. For one, Oriental Barbie is not entirely Asian in the sense that Hong Kong was occupied at the time of the doll’s release in 1981, which further complicates the issue of authenticity of racial and ethnic representation. Recalling the United States’ political relations with various Asian countries from the 1970s to the early 1980s may further contextualise Mattel’s decision to make Hong Kong the home of Oriental Barbie, as well as their choices behind which Asian countries to make an ethnic Barbie for. In the 1970s, Nixon’s ping-pong diplomacy had opened up previously fraught diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China. This change in diplomatic relations also facilitated increased cultural exchange between the two countries. In 1981—the year of Oriental Barbie’s debut and the year Reagan’s presidency began—Hong Kong was a popular U.S. tourist destination in Asia (Crouch 72-73). At the beginning of the 1980s, the Reagan administration’s decision to resist the Soviet Union also impacted on its diplomatic relations with Asian countries such as India, Japan, and China, each of which had varying opinions on how to deal with the U.S.S.R. (Greene 1). Despite differences in political stances, Mattel produced a Barbie for all three countries: India Barbie in 1982, Japanese Barbie in 1985, and Chinese Barbie over a decade later in 1994. Even 1994, the production year of Chinese Barbie, reflects the tensions between the U.S. and China in the early 1980s over the former’s arms sales to Taiwan and the two powers’ burgeoning partnership for “science and technology cooperation” in the 1990s (Minami 88). Contextualising Mattel’s potential reasoning for the particular production of these Asian Barbies allows us to understand why Mattel would want to offer educational content on these particular Asian “countries” (here a simulacrum with Oriental Barbie) to their primarily North-American based audience. Even then, Mattel’s intent to educate consumers through the reductiveness of their ethnographies contradicts itself, because the cultural marginalisation that results from the marketing and selling of Asian Barbies and the impact it has on the marginalised leads to a “self-contradiction inherent to the claims of civic functions (of furthering knowledge and enabling public enlightenment)—that accompany all imperialist establishments, even … apparently innocent ones” (Chow 95). Indeed, the “innocent” imperialist establishment of the child’s Barbie doll is not so innocent, as Jenny Wills reminds us: “sentimental, picturesque, and childhood playthings are not benign or devoid of serious racialized implications” (Wills 190). In fact, the name of “Oriental Barbie” or any other Asian Barbie “implies her difference, her not-quite-Barbieness”, which Wills first points out with the name of “Black Barbie”. Mattel demarcated a clear distinction between ethnic Barbies and white Barbies when it created and marketed the name of Oriental Barbie and other Asian Barbies. The positioning of Asian Barbies as an ethnic alternative thus creates what Wills calls a “scripted violence”, in which the relationship between white Barbie and ethnic Barbies “scripts racial inferiority upon those Other dolls and the subjects they are meant to celebrate and reflect” (Wills 189). The vitality of collecting ethnic Barbies as a business is deeply troubling, then, as it demonstrates both Mattel’s success in marketing Asian Barbies as an exoticised other and the many collectors who readily accept and contribute to this narrative. In fact, duCille reveals that “Mattel’s ethnic dolls — particularly those in its Dolls of the World series — are designed and marketed at least as much with adult collectors in mind as with little girls” (“Black Barbie” 339). Mattel media-relations director Donna Gibbs tells duCille that the ethnic dolls are actually marketed more towards adults, “‘although appropriate for children’” (“Black Barbie” 339). Gibbs lays out how Mattel strategically releases only “two or three different nations or cultures [for the Dolls of the World series] each year”, produces these “premium value” dolls in short supply in order to generate a competitive market for them, then retires them from the market after selling them for a mere one to two years (“Black Barbie” 339). Sure enough, Mattel’s marketing strategy proved successful: Westenhouser notes in The Story of Barbie that “the Oriental mold is a popular face mold to which collectors respond favorably” (Westenhouser 27). Because of Mattel’s strategic issuing of only two to three ethnic Barbies per year, “each year it becomes a collectors’ guessing game as to what countries will be this year’s additions” (Westenhouser 119). As a result, Mattel experienced a massive boost in sales through the marketing of the ethnic Barbie as a collectible. The treatment of race and ethnic difference as a commodified collectible rather than as genuine intercultural awareness is best evidenced by Mattel’s choice to produce Oriental Barbie—and all subsequent Asian Barbies, save for India Barbie—by using the same “Oriental Face Sculpt”. The “Oriental Face Sculpt” was introduced alongside the debut of Oriental Barbie in 1981, and although later productions of Asian Barbies in the Dolls of the World series expanded to specifically represent different Asian countries, such as Japan, China, and Korea, each Asian Barbie still used the same Oriental Face Sculpt. Augustyniak writes, “many new head molds have debuted since 1977, offering more variety and ethnic diversity” (8). When we observe the history of Barbie face sculpts, however, we find that many face sculpts have easily been produced of white Barbie over the years, with face sculpts even being made in honor of specific fashion designers or events, such as the 2013 Karl Lagerfeld, the 1991 Bob Mackie, and the 2008 Kentucky Derby. Meanwhile, the titular Barbie’s first two Asian friends both use the Oriental Sculpt: Miko (1986-1989), who is Pacific Islander (“Miko”) but was discontinued and replaced by Kira (1985-2001), who is allegedly of Japanese or Vietnamese heritage (“Kira”). These characters have only the Oriental Face Sculpt to represent their ethnic background, which itself remains ill-defined. With the plethora of face sculpts that have been produced over the years for white Barbies, one may be led to ponder why Mattel has not been willing to exert the same amount of effort to properly represent Asian Barbies. This is because for Mattel, profit always precedes any other motive, including racial and ethnic representation. As duCille explains, “the cost of mass-producing dolls to represent the heterogeneity of the world would be far greater than either corporation or consumer would be willing to pay” (“Black Barbie” 337). Hence, in order to generate profit, “racial and cultural diversity — global heterogeneity — must be reducible to … common, reproducible denominators” (“Black Barbie” 340). The Oriental Face Sculpt, then, is a result of all the “common, reproducible denominators” that Mattel deemed financially profitable enough to use as their attempt at racial and ethnic representation. The way that Mattel markets ethnic and cultural differences for Asian Barbies in addition to the use of the Oriental Face Sculpt, then, is through variations in skin colour and dress. For instance, Japanese Barbie, Korean Barbie, and Chinese Barbie all use the same Oriental Face Sculpt. The only notable differences between these dolls are the colour of their skin, the clothes that they wear, and their hairstyle. Indeed, duCille writes, while “today Barbie dolls come in a rainbow coalition of colors, races, ethnicities, and nationalities, all of those dolls look remarkably like the stereotypical white Barbie, modified only by a dash of color and a change of clothes” (Skin Trade 38). The uniformness of modularity with face sculpts, coupled with Mattel’s paltry efforts of merely altering the skin colour and clothing of each Asian Barbie, exemplifies Immanuel Wallerstein’s argument that “ethnicization must … be linked to the racism specific to the operations of modern capitalism with its twin objectives of maximizing profits and minimizing production costs” (qtd. in Chow 34). As a corporate giant, Mattel would not be enticed by the idea of adding “more complex, less easily commodified distinctions”, because these distinctions would require additional forms of manufacturing that complicate production and thus do not maximise profits for the corporate body (“Black Barbie” 340). Consequently, “ethnic reproductions [of Asian Barbies] ... simply [melt down and add on] a reconstituted other without transforming the established social order, without changing the mould” (“Black Barbie” 337-8). Mattel’s failure to provide racial and ethnic representation through Asian Barbies is best demonstrated, however, by a case study of India Barbie. India Barbie was released in 1982 as one of the first Asian Barbies, following the 1981 release of Oriental Barbie. Interestingly enough, India Barbie is the only Asian Barbie who was not created with the Oriental Face Sculpt. Instead, she has the Steffie face mold, which has been used with dolls such as: the titular Barbara Millicent Roberts, Midge, and Summer, who are all white; Teresa, who was introduced as Barbara’s first Latina friend in 1988; Christie, who became the first black Barbie in 1980 (“Steffie”); Hawaiian Barbie (1975) (Westenhouser 135); and Mexican Barbie (1989) (Westenhouser 121). Therefore, Mattel created India Barbie with a racially and ethnically ambiguous face sculpt that has also been used to depict white Barbies, which demonstrates the “relational proximity (or similarity) to [India Barbie’s] white doll counterparts” (Wills 189). The sari that India Barbie wears is additionally problematic in that it is worn inaccurately. Further, on the back side of the India Barbie (1982) box we see exoticising and othering language that insinuates the superiority of the Occident, as is the case for Oriental Barbie’s introduction. The way in which India Barbie is dressed with her sari is a far cry from how the sari is properly worn. What is also of interest is that India Barbie is wearing red and gold, which are colours typically only worn at Indian weddings. This sartorial choice may, at a first glance, be interpreted as yet another culturally insensitive blunder of Mattel’s, but when India Barbie’s outfit is considered alongside Japanese Barbie, who wears a red wedding kimono, and Malaysian Barbie, who also wears the semblance of a wedding garment, these choices of outfit begin to call into question why Mattel repeatedly decides to dress Asian Barbies in wedding attire. Mattel’s affinity for dressing Asian Barbies in bridal outfits can likely be explained by the corporation’s sales of wedding-affiliated Barbies, which have been some of the historically best-selling dolls in the Barbie universe. In the image caption for the Wedding Day Set (1959), which features the first Barbie wedding gown, Westenhouser notes, “always the top selling [Barbie] garment … is the wedding gown” (32). In Westenhouser’s view, Barbies wearing wedding gowns remain the best seller each year (32) because “every little girl dreams of the perfect romantic wedding and Barbie makes that fairytale come alive” (32). From a capitalist standpoint, then, Mattel is simply capitalising upon the supposedly widespread demand for Barbies in wedding dresses, and Mattel can only further ensure the financial success of Asian Barbies by choosing to dress Barbies such as India Barbie in semblances of wedding attire, even if these outfits are not culturally accurate or fully representative. Aside from the matter of dressing India Barbie in a red and gold sari, there is also the question of why Mattel chooses to focus on descriptions of Asian Barbies’ hair so heavily, including that of India Barbie. For instance, with the India Barbie and Japanese Barbie, Mattel uses nearly identical phrasing of the doll’s hair being pulled back to reveal the “delicate features” of her face. India Barbie’s description reads: “her long brown hair is pulled back, accenting her delicate features” (“India Barbie”), while Japanese Barbie’s description reads: “her black hair is pulled away from her face and tied with a red and white hairband” (“Japanese Barbie”). This diction first appears in Oriental Barbie’s product description, and it is especially interesting to consider why Mattel might emphasise the entirety of an Asian Barbie’s face being shown, almost as if to suggest that her face is so exotic that it needs to be fully on display for the consumer to get a proper look at the exotic “other’s” face. It seems that with Mattel’s emphasis on the entirety of the Asian Barbie’s face being revealed, ethnicity becomes “the site of a foreignness” that is a privileged society’s way of “projecting into some imaginary outside elements it seems foreign and inferior” (Chow 34-5). Throughout our case study of numerous Asian Barbies, Mattel’s portrayal of racial and ethnic difference has always been in a highly performative manner that has only been superficially signified through changes in skin colour and dress and the near-perpetual use of the exoticising Oriental Face Sculpt. These othering and fetishising attempts at multicultural representation create, as Wills argues, “exoticized difference, of deferred subjectivity; racial progressiveness [that] can be purchased and played with” (Wills 189) then cast off, as Powell’s notion of the cultural safari allows us to understand. Critically, Mattel markets these Orientalist depictions of racial, ethnic, and cultural identity as “marketable difference[s]” (Wills 189) that the white consumer can supposedly try on with ease and just as easily remove. Thus, with the production and marketing of Asian Barbies and other ethnic dolls, Mattel never truly accomplishes a healthy and helpful extension of the individual child as Ruth Handler envisioned all Barbies to be—instead, the corporate body only perpetuates a narrative of racial inferiority and the casting of Asian Barbie dolls (and, by extension, the Asian cultures, geographical locations, and populations that Mattel claims to represent) as the Other.

However, gold price changes had insignificant positive effects on stock returns in Indonesia during geopolitical events, while the DXY Index had insignificant, negative effects. Research Implications: Investors and traders in Indonesia Stock Exchange should consider oil price changes for investing in stocks during geopolitical events. Originality/Value: This study contributes to literatures regarding the stock market turbulence during geopolitical events and its effect toward stock return. The relevance and value of this research are evidenced by the insignificanct effect of gold and DXY toward stock return, while WTI has significant effect toward stock return.",2024-06-10,
Electricity Spot Prices Forecasting Using Stochastic Volatility Models,"There are several approaches to modeling and forecasting time series as applied to prices of commodities and financial assets. One of the approaches is to model the price as a non-stationary time series process with heteroscedastic volatility (variance of price). The goal of the research is to generate probabilistic forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices in a spot marker employing stochastic volatility models. A typical stochastic volatility model - that treats the volatility as a latent stochastic process in discrete time - is explored first. Then the research focuses on enriching the baseline model by introducing several exogenous regressors. A better fitting model - as compared to the baseline model - is derived as a result of the research. Out-of-sample forecasts confirm the applicability and robustness of the enriched model. This model may be used in financial derivative instruments for hedging the risk associated with electricity trading.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag model to explore the effects of different factors on Bitcoin's prices across various market situations. This method allows for a detailed analysis of historical trends, investor expectations and external market influences on Bitcoin's price movements and systematic stability. Findings Key findings reveal historical prices and investor expectations significantly influence Bitcoin in all market scenarios, with news sentiment exhibiting substantial volatility. This study indicates that oil prices have minimal impacts on Bitcoin, whereas gold is a stabilizing asset in bear markets, with the S&amp;P index influencing short-term fluctuations. At the same time, Bitcoin's volatility varies with market conditions, proving more efficient as a hedging tool in bear and stable markets than in bull ones. Originality/value This study highlights the intrinsic correlation between Bitcoin's prices, news sentiment and financial market indicators, enhancing understanding of Bitcoin's market dynamics. The authors demonstrate Bitcoin's weak direct correlation with commodities like oil, the stabilizing role of gold in crypto portfolios and the stock market's indirect effect on Bitcoin prices. By examining these factors' impacts across various market conditions, the findings offer strategies for investors to improve hedging and portfolio management in cryptocurrency markets.",2024-06-08,
Changes in food consumption expenditure during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia,"Purpose This study aims to explore the structural changes in food consumption expenditure in Indonesia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the 2020 and 2021 National Socioeconomic Survey by Statistics Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach The quadratic almost-ideal demand system analysis model is used to estimate changes in the share of food consumption and the demand and price elasticity of food commodities in Indonesia. A total of 15 food items are analyzed to determine changes in food consumption expenditure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The results of this study show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the proportion of household expenditure related to the consumption of home-cooked food. Simultaneously, the proportion of expenditure on prepared food significantly decreased. Practical implications The pandemic has changed household food consumption in Indonesia. This study recommends that the government ensure the availability of supplies and stability of food prices and provide financial subsidies to maintain food consumption, especially for lower-income communities. Originality/value There has yet to be a study on the changes in household food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Therefore, this research provides empirical evidence that there were changes in household food expenditure during the pandemic.",2024-06-08,
The history of globalisation between 1870 and 2020,"The history of globalisation provides an overview of the major economic and selected geopolitical events that have shaped the world over the 150-year period. Since 1870, four waves of globalisation have been identified. The First Wave is seen as the period since the late 19th century, 1870, and came to an end with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The Second Wave commenced after the deglobalisation era between the two world wars and ended in 1989 with the end of the Cold War period. This 45-year period includes a major global economic restructuring and re-globalisation period; however, it is also defined by the continued primary commodity dependence, the Third World Debt crisis, and the deepening of global inequality. The Third Wave covering the period 1990–2007 is seen as a hyper-globalisation period with the further liberalisation of trade, the greater economic participation of China and the emerging market economies, the increased awareness of climate change, and the acceptance of the Millennium Development Goals. The Fourth Wave, commencing in 2010, was shaped by the impact of the policy choices after the Global Financial Crisis, the rising of the digital economy, the intensified influence of China as a global powerhouse, the growing economic nationalism trends, and the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Fourth Wave never reached the globalisation levels experienced during the Third Wave and is showing characteristics of a slowbalisation period. This wave ended with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic early in 2020.",2024-06-07,
"Investigating the price determinants of the European Emission Trading
  System: a non-parametric approach","The European carbon market plays a pivotal role in the European Union's ambitious target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Understanding the intricacies of factors influencing European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) market prices is paramount for effective policy making and strategy implementation. We propose the use of the Information Imbalance, a recently introduced non-parametric measure quantifying the degree to which a set of variables is informative with respect to another one, to study the relationships among macroeconomic, economic, uncertainty, and energy variables concerning EU ETS prices. Our analysis shows that in Phase 3 commodity related variables such as the ERIX index are the most informative to explain the behaviour of the EU ETS market price. Transitioning to Phase 4, financial fluctuations take centre stage, with the uncertainty in the EUR/CHF exchange rate emerging as a crucial determinant. These results reflect the disruptive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis in reshaping the importance of the different variables. Beyond variable analysis, we also propose to leverage the Information Imbalance to address the problem of mixed-frequency forecasting, and we identify the weekly time scale as the most informative for predicting the EU ETS price. Finally, we show how the Information Imbalance can be effectively combined with Gaussian Process regression for efficient nowcasting and forecasting using very small sets of highly informative predictors.",2024-06-07,
FAIR VALUE AND COST APPROACHES IN ACCRETION ACCRETION OF SHEEP BIOLOGICAL ASSETS (CASE STUDY AT KENDAL OPEN PRIVATE FARM),"The purpose of this study is to analyze and describe the measurement of the biological assets of sheep using the fair value and cost approach in accordance with the concept of accretion to the measurement of biological assets contained in PSAK 69. PSAK 69 which refers to IAS 41 emphasizes that biological assets are measured fairly and if the difference included in profit or loss in the financial statements. However, in the context of the application of commodity agribusiness in Indonesia, discrepancies are still found, therefore more studies are needed to discuss the application of PSAK 69 to agricultural commodities in Indonesia, especially in sheep farming. The focus of the research was carried out at the Kendal Open Prison Farm. The research method is a qualitative descriptive research by obtaining data through interviews and observation at the research location. The results are the recognition of the biological assets of sheep using the fair value approach is less relevant than the cost approach in agribusiness commodities in Indonesia during the transformation of the development of biological assets.",2024-06-07,
Analisa Tentang Kebijakan Moneter Islam dan Pendapatan Negara Terhadap Pertumbuhan Ekonomi,"This research analyzes Islamic monetary policy and state revenues in the context of economic growth, especially in Indonesia. Monetary policy is the government's effort to improve economic conditions by regulating the amount of money in circulation. In the context of an economic crisis, monetary policy becomes important to balance the real sector and overcome the problem of currency value and the role of money as a commodity that sells interest or usury. This research reveals that monetary policy has input in the form of monetary policy instruments that influence the amount of money in circulation, while the output includes price stability and economic output. Islamic monetary policy is emphasized as a policy that must be free from usury and interest, following the principle of profit sharing in money management. Apart from that, this research also reviews monetary policy during the time of Rasulullah SAW, where monetary management was based on the principle of baitul mal and the allocation of funds for the spread of Islam, education, infrastructure development and social welfare. an Islamic economic perspective, monetary policy must pay attention to economic welfare with full employment opportunities, socio-economic justice, income distribution, and stability of the value of money. This refers to the principles of maqasid sharia in creating balance and prosperity for society. Monetary policy in Indonesia, led by Bank Indonesia, uses various instruments such as reference interest rates, open market operations, provision of liquidity, regulation of storage facilities, and reserve requirements. mandatory to achieve price stability, economic growth and financial system stability. This research provides in-depth insight into the importance of Islamic monetary policy in achieving macroeconomic goals and its impact on economic growth in Indonesia.",2024-06-05,

The metropole strikes back,"Crucially, Cain and Hopkins reassert the view held by earlier theorists of empire such as Hobson and Lenin, that the origins of British imperialism lay principally in the economic development of the metropole. More recent work on the relationships between industrialists and City financial interests does tend to support certain aspects of Daunton's argument. Bowen shows that even such a stalwart institution of gentlemanly capitalism as the East India Company developed extensive contacts with provincial industry in order to generate commodities for profitable export. Niall Ferguson demonstrates how the kinship, intelligence and business networks of Rothschilds across Europe vested that family with huge political influence, showing how gentlemanly capitalists could shape policies towards nations and territories without as well as within the empire. The chronological range of Cain and Hopkins' work, which traces the empire up to the late twentieth century, has undoubtedly helped propel their thesis to prominence.",2024-06-04,
Inequality and Stagnation,"The book examines how the outgrowth of the financial industry has contributed to the recent tendencies towards inequality and stagnation. It proposes a monetary interpretation of these events using a Classical–Keynesian theoretical approach derived from the work of Keynes and Sraffa. The approach moves from the distributive conflicts among economic and social groups, presuming that they influence the legislation shaping the organisation of the markets and the policy of the authorities. It argues that the degrees of liquidity of assets, which reflect the individual perceptions of their future prices, ultimately depend on the organisation of the markets and policy decisions. The development of his work persuaded Keynes that it was necessary to revolutionise the scientific foundations of economic discipline to effectively interpret events and recommend policies. He consequently introduced in 1932 a monetary theory of production. Following these lines, Sraffa proposed in Production of Commodities to take the rate of interest as an independent variable in the theory of distribution. Using the Classical–Keynesian approach, the book shows how the changes in legislation and policies since the abandonment of the Bretton Woods agreements have caused the outgrowth of finance and how these alterations have raised financial instability. It identifies various competitive mechanisms through which financial events can affect income distribution and growth, describing how they have triggered the recent tendencies towards inequality and stagnation. This book is essential reading for researchers studying the interactions among financial markets, distribution, and growth.",2024-06-04,
"Herding behaviour surrounding the Russo–Ukraine war and COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from energy, metal, livestock and grain commodities","Purpose This study examines herding behaviour in commodity markets amid two major global upheavals: the Russo–Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach By analysing 18 commodity futures worldwide, the study examines herding trends in metals, livestock, energy and grains sectors. The applied methodology combines static and dynamic approaches by incorporating cross-sectional absolute deviations (CSAD) and a time-varying parameter (TVP) regression model extended by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adequately reflect the complexity of herding behaviour in different market scenarios. Findings Our results show clear differences in herd behaviour during these crises. The Russia–Ukraine war led to relatively subdued herding behaviour in commodities, suggesting a limited impact of geopolitical turmoil on collective market behaviour. In stark contrast, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly amplified herding behaviour, particularly in the energy and livestock sectors. Originality/value This discrepancy emphasises the different impact of a health crisis versus a geopolitical conflict on market dynamics. This study makes an important contribution to the existing literature as it is one of the first studies to contrast herding behaviour in commodity markets during these two crises. Our results show that not all crises produce comparable market reactions, which underlines the importance of the crisis context when analysing financial market behaviour.",2024-06-03,
Finansjeryzacja lokalności i kulturowe spojrzenie na pieniądz finansowy,"Financialization is “a pattern of accumulation in which profits accrue primarily through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production”. The expansion of the financial sector is enabled by a credit money mechanism that takes on a fictitious character. As a result, financialization leads to the reproduction of social inequality and the subordination of individual behavior to the logic of financial markets. According to critics of the process, local culture is being destroyed by credit money. In this paper, the author points to the social basis of financialization by demonstrating the ways in which local communities produce money – personalizing it and creating its meaning based on debt relationships. He illustrates the influence of culture on money using the example of microfinance and its criticism. Finally, the author proposes a different perspective on financialization, which – by combining the mutual influence of culture and money – allows for changing the categories of thinking about contemporary sources of locality and the divide between the global and the local. Key-words: financialization, microfinance, money theory, credit money, debt relationships, local communities",2024-06-03,
Physical Means and Trading Network of Onrust in the 17th and 18th Centuries,"This research aims to examine the physical facilities and trade networks on Onrust Island in the 17th-18th centuries. Onrust Island is a small island located in Batavia Bay (Jakarta) and has an important role in the history of trade in the Dutch East Indies. This research uses historical research methods through heuristics, source criticism, interpretation, and historiography. The research results show that Onrust has adequate physical facilities to support VOC trading operations, such as shipyards, warehouses, and commodity processing facilities. In the 17th century, Onrust also became Batavia's first defense center. In the 18th century, ship repair activities at Onrust began to decline due to the VOC's financial difficulties. However, Onrust remained an important post in the VOC trade network in the archipelago. This island became a stopover for the VOC trade fleet from various ports in Java and its surroundings. Products such as spices, wood, salt and others stopped at Onrust before being distributed further by the VOC. Thus, Onrust played an integral role in the VOC's maritime trade network in the archipelago in the 17th and 18th centuries through the infrastructure and logistics support it provided.",2024-06-02,
"ATTRACTION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN THE ECONOMY OF UKRAINE: TRENDS, PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION","The global environment for international business and cross-border investment remains challenging in 2023. Although the economic obstacles that shaped investment trends in 2022 have subsided somewhat, they have not disappeared. Commodity prices, which spiked during the war in Ukraine, have come down, but the war continues and geopolitical tensions remain high. Recenupheavals in the financial sector in some developed countries are adding to investor uncertainty. The purpose of the study is to identify trends, diagnose problems, and develop promising directions for attracting foreign investment to the economy of Ukraine. In order to solve the set goal, the following scientific tasks were solved in the course of the study: the dynamics of the inflow of foreign investments and the structure of FDI into the national economy were analyzed by regional characteristics and by types of economic activity; the deterioration of the investment attractiveness of the national economy due to the reduction of the stock of FDI of Ukraine and the decrease of the index of investment attractiveness is substantiated; identified the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats of attracting foreign investments to the economy of Ukraine based on the results of the SWOT analysis. In order to solve the set goal, the research determined FDI trends in the national economy and made conclusions about ""investment shocks"" associated with the global financial crisis of 2008, the start of the war in Donbas, COVID-19 and the full-scale war in Ukraine. This conclusion was reached by comparing the dynamics of the Investment Attractiveness Index of Ukraine with the flow of FDI into Ukraine, the trends of which were synchronized. For greater thoroughness of the research, the main foreign investors in the corporate segment were identified by the authors as companies (brands) that already had facilities in Ukraine at the time of the full-scale war and corporations that announced their intention to reinvest funds in Ukraine to support their assets. The authors substantiated the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats of attracting foreign investments to the economy of Ukraine based on the results of a SWOT analysis.",2024-06-01,
Kelly Criterion Extension: Advanced Gambling Strategy,"This article introduces an innovative extension of the Kelly criterion, which has traditionally been used in gambling, sports wagering, and investment contexts. The Kelly criterion extension (KCE) refines the traditional capital growth function to better suit dynamic market conditions. The KCE improves the traditional approach to accommodate the complexities of financial markets, particularly in stock and commodity trading. This innovative method focuses on crafting strategies based on market conditions and player actions rather than direct asset investments, which enhances its practical application by minimizing risks associated with volatile investments. This paper is structured to first outline the foundational concepts of the Kelly criterion, followed by a detailed presentation of the KCE and its advantages in practical scenarios, including a case study on its application to blackjack strategy optimization. The mathematical framework and real-world applicability of the KCE are thoroughly discussed, demonstrating its potential to bridge the gap between theoretical finance and actual trading outcomes.",2024-06-01,
"Uncertainty, Financial Markets, and Fund Flows to South Africa","ABSTRACT: Economic growth in South Africa over the last decade has been disappointing. Even before the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy was underperforming. South Africa needs high and sustained growth to reduce the rate of unemployment, which has remained stubbornly high at over 30% for many years. Fund flows may provide capital to spur this needed growth. Fund flows are a critical issue in emerging markets like South Africa as sudden reversals have also been associated with severe destabilizing effects. These concerns and the substantial growth in fund flows to South Africa in the past two decades motivate this study. We examine the relationships among fund flows, uncertainty measures, economic indicators, and financial market variables in South Africa. We estimate several vector autoregressions to account for the inherent feedback among fund flows and economic and financial variables. We find that the term structure of interest rates (TERM) is negatively related to equity fund flows (EFF) while positively related to bond fund flows (BFF). While BFF and EFF are both negatively related to most uncertainty measures, BFF is more sensitive to downside risk indictors than EFF. We show that the economic and financial development of South Africa is impacted by fund flows with GDP being more strongly impacted by BFF while stock returns are impacted by both BFF and EFF. We also uncover evidence that commodity prices increase BFF. Next, we show that the volatility of the South African equity market immediately reduces equity prices which attracts EFF after a two-to-three-month lag. Finally, we uncover convincing evidence that illiquidity as measured by effective spread reduces EFF to South Africa. The ability to better predict the direction EFF and BFF will allow policy makers to impose circuit breakers to mitigate the adverse impacts of sudden investment reversals. This is particularly relevant to the current situation where additional financial uncertainty due to the energy crisis in South Africa coupled with political instability may increase the likelihood of such reversals.",2024-06-01,
Nature-related financial risks and central bank risk management,"Nature is undergoing a rapid decline, due to factors such as changes in land use, climate change and pollution, potentially leading to the sixth mass extinction of species. This process jeopardises ecosystem services and therewith the global economy. Over half of the global economy relies on nature and its degradation can affect supply chains, weather patterns, commodity prices and economic growth prospects. This paper finds that nature-related risks are in fact financial risks and offers empirical evidence that these risks are priced in corporate bonds, a relevant asset class for central banks. In light of this, central banks can acknowledge and evaluate the impact and dependency of their operations on nature, incorporating these considerations into their risk management framework, encompassing identification, assessment, mitigation and disclosure. This will help to ensure price stability and sustainable development, while enabling them to safeguard their balance sheets. The guidelines provided by this paper extend to other financial institutions, underscoring the need for a holistic approach to the challenges posed by nature loss.",2024-06-01,
Sustainability marketing when introducing a new product to the market,"Methods. The study of the problems of marketing development was based on the conceptual foundations of the theory of sustainability marketing. As methodological approaches, SNW-analysis was used – for the purpose of researching the factors of the marketing environment, BCG matrix – for the analysis of product potential. Specific tools of scientific research were used: statistical methods – to demonstrate the dynamics of financial and economic indicators of the enterprise's activity; comparison – when comparing the prices of commodity products. Results. There are analyzed the marketing activities of a large company, a leader in the mineral water market, a part of a large corporation IDS Group Ukraine, a well-known trademark «Morshynska». The analysis of the internal environment of the enterprise, in particular, the SNWanalysis for TM «Morshynska» is carried out. It is determined that the growth of awareness of ecology and sustainable development can stimulate demand for environmentally friendly products, including mineral water. It is determined that sustainability marketing is the formation of heterogeneous demand on the basis of sustainability and care for the environment, long-term prospects for the development of society. The focus of the enterprise's marketing strategy on eco-standards of products, as well as the expansion of the manufacturer's range, is very reasonable. Novelty. Based on the results of the analysis, it is determined that the enterprise PJSC MZMV «OSCAR» should use a diversification strategy to open a new direction of its products – «green marketing». Practical value. The conducted analysis allows to improve the management of marketing activities of manufacturing enterprises in the plane of sustainable development.",2024-06-01,
Do commodities offer diversification benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis? Evidence from dynamic spillover approach,"This paper examines the diversification benefits of commodity indices during the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing both static and dynamic risk spillovers for the period from January 2, 1998 to September 16, 2020. Using variance decomposition forecasting, we employed static and dynamic analyses based on the estimation of 50-day moving window spillover indices. Globally, the results show significant spillovers between markets during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The results show that stock markets are highly interdependent with other financial markets (in both directions), and that commodity markets (except energy) and the bond market are recipients of shocks emanating from stock markets. The main contribution of this paper is to study the return and volatility spillovers between stock and commodity indices before and during the pandemic. This study of shock transmission mechanisms will enable investors to develop optimal diversification and hedging strategies during the crisis. In this context, we found that commodities and US government bonds could offer diversification benefits to investors. In addition, some of these assets may serve as hedging instruments or safe havens during the COVID-19 crisis.",2024-06-01,

Traffic Safety Improvisation – An Indian Scenario,"Abstract Transportation on roads provides the flow of commodities and individuals. It also helps in increasing the availability of employment, financial sectors, education, and medical care, all of which have resulted in positive impacts impact upon the wellness of individuals. Nevertheless, the growth in mobility has a significant impact on the health of individuals due to road traffic injuries. In Indian Society, road safety is a much-disputed subject. Due to unavailable data on road safety, the action that is taken against the problems is at times, it is mostly dependent on one’s opinion, while at other times it is policy-driven. Solutions for road traffic deaths and injuries (RTIs) must be multifrontal and multi-spiked in implementation. Generally, in our country, people’s perspectives are very centered on being close to a road-kill person. Traffic participant education plays a vital part in reducing road traffic deaths and injuries. Among people of all ages, Traffic mishaps are the eighth leading factor of unintentional loss of life globally. Thus, there is a need to make a system that helps make road transportation economically and socially more sustainable and decreases the figure of losses in street accidents. In this paper, we will try to review the underlying issues, the changing face of the transport environment, how these changes affect India, operating risk factors, major systematic challenges facing road safety devices, and usual techniques that add to the loss of life and frailty. This review paper will also highlight some actions that need to be employed to reduce the number of accidental deaths.",2024-06-01,
Inclusiveness Analysis of the Beef Cattle Value Chain in Central Java Province,"Abstract Blora Regency of Central Java Province initiated the development of strategic areas for beef cattle commodities in Indonesia. The majority of the region’s farmers are smallholders who operate household-level livestock businesses. While the involvement of small farmers in the value chain for these activities is essential, it is regrettable to note that their participation is not optimal. Therefore, this study used an inclusive business model approach aimed at analyzing the inclusiveness of farmers using a link methodology as well as identifying the inclusiveness factors of smallholders. Undertaking a comprehensive evaluation of the principles underpinning a new business model (NBM) is regarded as a valuable and effective means of fostering inclusivity and equality among all relevant stakeholders involved in the business. The NBM consists of six principles including collaboration across the entire supply chain, effective market connectivity, appropriate and transparent governance, accessibility to services, inclusive innovation, and performance measurement. Respondents were selected based on census data. The results show that the inclusiveness of farmers is still low in standardized and transparent governance, inclusive innovation, and outcome measurements. Enhancing farmers’ inclusiveness includes improving their performance and innovation, establishing market linkages, providing non-financial services, fostering value chain collaboration, offering financial assistance, and monitoring and evaluating the impact of their initiatives.",2024-06-01,
Young Men's Livelihoods in “Waiting”,"Abstract This article examines how the commodity cycle of natural gas alters the aspirations of youth working in the informal sector. Focusing on the gas industry in Mtwara, Tanzania, this article explores how the development of the industry influences the work aspirations of young men seeking financial independence. Drawing from ethnographic research, participant observation, and interviews with young men between 2020 and 2022, I demonstrate how working as motorcycle taxi drivers during the “gas rush” availed young men a newfound respectability linked to their upward socioeconomic mobility, a key marker in their transition to adulthood. As one of the more accessible and lucrative livelihoods, this article demonstrates how becoming a motorcycle driver acted as a transient conduit in their dual transitions from school to work and transitions from young men to adults.",2024-06-01,
Organizational Resilience and the Attention-Based View of the Firm—Empirical Evidence from German SMEs,"The need for organizations to increase resilience is still growing, not least because of economic crises, such as the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and supply shortages in raw material procurement combined with rising commodity costs and energy prices. We use an attention-based view approach as a theoretical lens to investigate the shift in management’s attention due to a crisis, with a particular focus on working capital management (WCM) as a decisive finance tool. In addition, we examine how management’s attention shifts to organizational resilience (OR). We also analyze how managers’ cognitive flexibility (CF), which reflects their ability to anticipate and quickly adapt, moderates the change in attention. By surveying 307 top and middle managers in German small- and medium-sized enterprises, we measure the crisis effect on the shift in managerial attention to WCM and OR. In addition, we measure managers’ CF and examine the contribution of these individual characteristics in the context of WCM and OR. Our mediation model reveals a positive, indirect-only effect of the crisis on the shift in management attention to OR mediated by the shift in management attention to WCM. In addition, our results show that managers’ CF negatively moderates the effect between managerial focus shifts to WCM and to OR. Our study’s results deepen the understanding of the importance of managers’ CF in times of crisis and the impact of CF on sales development, suggesting that managers’ CF may influence the link between the focal characteristics of WCM and OR.",2024-05-31,
Paper Steaks: Live Cattle Futures Markets and the Financial Revolution of 1964,"This article argues that live cattle futures, launched in 1964 in Chicago, were revolutionary for professional economics, the derivatives industry, and the beef cattle industry because cattle were the first successful “non-storable” derivatives. Since the late nineteenth century, the ability of derivatives to provide financial services to risk-averse farmers rested on the assumption that futures were interchangeable with physical commodities in storage. Live cattle futures upset theories and norms, which enabled experiments in increasingly abstract forms of speculation and tremendous growth in the derivatives industry. Economists, exchange leaders, and commodity producers cooperated to make live cattle futures work, but they all understood and felt their impacts differently. The article applies market performativity theory to better understand how financial instruments and markets became first less and later more physically abstract over time. The article reveals that the changing materiality of derivatives also led to changes in the social purpose of speculative finance. Sources include published economics articles, conference proceedings, congressional hearings, historical newspapers, and archival records from the derivatives and cattle industries.",2024-05-31,

Unveiling the Lead-Lag Relationship Among Metal Derivatives in the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) of India: A Comprehensive Analysis,"<title>Abstract</title> This research paper delves into the substantial impact of commodity exchanges in India on the economy, specifically focusing on the areas of improved price discovery and the facilitation of systematic derivatives trading. Market participants, including hedgers and traders, effectively utilize futures contracts as strategic tools to control prices and capitalize on market volatility. Both agricultural and non-agricultural products are actively traded in the spot and futures markets, with metals emerging as the dominant category on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX). The process of price discovery within financial markets is a pivotal factor that ensures sustainable trading practices. Through an extensive study analyzing the relationship between spot and futures prices of seven metal derivatives traded on the MCX over a decade-long period, significant correlations have been identified across all cases.<bold>JEL Codes: C32, C58,G13</bold>",2024-05-31,
Exploring Asymmetric GARCH Models for Predicting Indian Base Metal Price Volatility,"Abstract Research background Many studies have been done in the field of predicting the Volatility of Commodities; however, very little or no analysis has been conducted on any sector, industry, or indices to identify which model is best to understand the asset’s characteristics, as there is a hypothesis that all financial time series can be interpreted by implementing the same model. Purpose The primary objective is to identify different tools developed by the researchers in estimating impulsive clustering and leverage effects. A comparison will be made among the available tools of the GARCH family models to suggest the best tool to forecast and calculate volatility with the least error. Research methodology The data used are historical time series data of Indian base metal indices, i.e., Aluminum (AL), Copper (CO), Lead (LE), Nickel (NI), and Zinc (ZI) from NSE for a period from 1st June 2012 to 31st August 2022 from the official website of NSE of India. The study compared and attempted to identify which GARCH family model is suitable to measure the volatility clustering and leverage effect in Indian base metal indices by reducing the chances of error. Results The study has revealed that the GRACH asymmetric models, while approximating and predicting the financial time series, can enhance the model’s output when it has a high frequency. Here, the asymmetric GARCH models (TARCH, CGARCH, EGARCH, and PARCH) better predict volatility than classic models. Novelty This study is original in its approach, as a previous study stated the presence of volatility or leverage effect by implementing any one tool. However, this study will compare available tools to suggest which is appropriate for which sector. This analysis will support future researchers and practitioners in evaluating volatility clustering and the effect of leverage by implementing the appropriate GARCH family model without believing in a hypothesis that a single model is good enough to predict volatility.",2024-05-31,
Dampak Spillover Antara Harga Komoditas dan Dinamika Pasar Keuangan,"Background: Interconnectedness among finacial and commodity prices beyond what can be explained by fundamentals, saw a significant rise from 2004 to 2008, reaching their highest point during the global financial crisis. The problem of this research addresses the increasing interdependence and volatility caused by financialization.Purpose: This study examines the complex spillover effects between financial markets and commodity prices from January 2021 to March 2024.Design/methodology/approach: This study employs two approaches: a qualitative approach through a systematic literature review (SLR) and a quantitative approach. Using data from major stock indices and key, we employed Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models to analyze the dynamics.Findings/Result: The study literature indicates a lack of research comprehensive analysis of the spillover effects between financial and commodity markets. Results indicate significant impacts of stock market shocks, particularly in the U.S., on energy prices, and the substantial influence of commodity market fluctuations on the Hong Kong stock market. Conclusion: These findings highlight the critical role of financial markets in driving commodity price volatility and emphasize the need for strategic portfolio diversification and robust risk management. Continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies are essential to mitigate cross-market impacts and ensure market stability, providing valuable insights for policymakers and market participants.Originality/value (State of the art): The value of this research lies in its focus on the recent period, its use of a mixed method approach, and its identification of specific impacts of market shocks on different instruments.

"Assessing Bitcoin, gold and gold-backed cryptocurrencies as safe havens for energy and agricultural commodities: insights from COVID-19, Russia–Ukraine conflict and SVB collapse","Purpose This paper aims to investigate the safe haven feature of Bitcoin, gold and two gold-backed cryptocurrencies (DGX and PAXG) against energy and agricultural commodities (crude oil, natural gas and wheat) during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine conflict and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse. Design/methodology/approach The authors use the threshold GARCH (T-GARCH)-asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation (ADCC) model to evaluate the asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation between the return series and compare the diversifying, hedging and safe-haven ability of Bitcoin, gold and the two gold-backed cryptocurrencies (DGX and PAXG) against financial swings in the commodity market during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Russian–Ukrainian military conflict and SVB collapse. The authors also calculate the hedging ratios (HR) and hedging effectiveness index (HE). The authors finally use the wavelet coherence (WC) approach to check our results’ robustness and further investigate the impact of the three crises on the relationship between Bitcoin, gold gold-backed cryptocurrencies and commodities. Findings The results show that PAXG serves as a strong hedging instrument while gold, Bitcoin and DGX act as strong diversifiers during normal times. During crises, gold outperforms Bitcoin as a diversifier and a safe haven against commodities. Gold-backed cryptocurrencies also exhibit strong performance as diversifiers and safe havens. HR results indicate that Bitcoin and DGX are more cost-effective for commodities risk mitigation than gold and PAXG. In terms of hedging effectiveness, gold and PAXG emerge as the best hedging instruments for commodities, while DGX is considered the worst one. Bitcoin shows superior hedging against oil compared to wheat and gas risks. Moreover, the results of the WC approach confirm those of the T-GARCH-ADCC results in both the short and long run. Originality/value This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the diversification ability of gold, Bitcoin and gold-backed cryptocurrencies during different crises (the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine conflict and the SVB collapse). By taking into consideration gold-backed cryptocurrencies, the authors expand the understanding of safe havens beyond conventional assets.",2024-05-30,
Housing Narratives for Post-Carbon Inclusive Societies,"The climate emergency and COVID-19 have brought fresh urgency to both housing financialization and home as building blocks of societies.

"Modelling and Forecasting Energy Market Volatility Using GARCH and
  Machine Learning Approach","This paper presents a comparative analysis of univariate and multivariate GARCH-family models and machine learning algorithms in modeling and forecasting the volatility of major energy commodities: crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas. It uses a comprehensive dataset incorporating financial, macroeconomic, and environmental variables to assess predictive performance and discusses volatility persistence and transmission across these commodities. Aspects of volatility persistence and transmission, traditionally examined by GARCH-class models, are jointly explored using the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) method. The findings reveal that machine learning models demonstrate superior out-of-sample forecasting performance compared to traditional GARCH models. Machine learning models tend to underpredict, while GARCH models tend to overpredict energy market volatility, suggesting a hybrid use of both types of models. There is volatility transmission from crude oil to the gasoline and heating oil markets. The volatility transmission in the natural gas market is less prevalent.",2024-05-30,

Jumping up the sanitation ladder in rural Cambodia: The role of remittances and peer-to-peer pressure in adopting high-quality latrines,"Over the last 50 years, a combination of factors has driven sanitation improvements in rural areas of low-income and emerging economies in Asia. While open defecation remains an important challenge in many countries, Cambodia has rapidly increased rural sanitation coverage in the last 20 years. Using data collected via 92 interviews and seven focus group discussions, this qualitative study analysed the macro-level, community, and individual factors that motivated rural households to invest in high-quality latrines in seven villages in Cambodia that achieved and sustained open defecation free status with at least 85% latrine coverage. Local demand for adoption of high quality latrine was stimulated by a number of factors which include: a) NGO-led interventions that included behaviour change communication, sanitation marketing, and community-led total sanitation, all magnified by the strong support of local leaders at the village and commune levels; b) an increased proportion of rural households engaging in factory work, with access to raising wages, higher disposable incomes, and remittances; and c) subsidies and microcredit. Furthermore, migrants not only transferred financial resources to their home villages, but also transferred a set of ideas, norms, expectations, information, and behaviors back to their communities that reflect the migrants’ new ways of life, and economic possibilities. We provide evidence that new habits among factory workers, and ownership and display of new technologies and consumer commodities as symbols of modern success and social status facilitated high-quality latrine adoption. Peer-to-peer pressure at the village level, and among adult children commuting to factories or visiting their rural hometown ensured widespread adoption.",2024-05-29,
Modeling and analysis of risk factors affecting operation of photovoltaic power plants,"The operation stage in photovoltaic (PV) power plants is considered one of the most imperative stages to achieve the sustainability of these projects. There are many risk factors that affect the PV operating goals, such as energy output, cost, and lifespan. The aim of this study is to identify the main risk groups and risk factors associated with operating the solar PV power plants, as well as to assess and analyze the effects of these risk factors on the operation process. Sixty-two risk factors are grouped into nine different risk categories associated with international regulation, technology, financial and economic, supply chain, environmental, climate change, market, organizational, and safety. To overcome the problem of conjoining multi characteristics for any risk factor, a model for qualitative risk analysis using fuzzy logic features is developed. Through three new indices, the model adds a suitable factor analysis that links several effects on PV operating goals in order to figure out how important each risk factor is. Results show that the most significant risk factors that pose high threats to the operation of the solar PVs include ""Grid Stability"" for energy output, ""Commodity Price"" for cost, and ""Maintenance Challenges"" for life span, while ""Energy Storage"" is observed to be the most frequent in these projects. For the results of the group analysis, the Technology Risk group is evaluated as the most important risk group that affects the operation of the solar PV power plant. There is a high association between cost and lifespan, whereas most influencing risk factors affect both energy output and lifespan.",2024-05-28,
"Deciphering volatility spillovers amidst crises: analyzing the interplay among commodities, equities and socially responsible investments during the COVID-19 shock and financial turbulence","Purpose This study aims to elucidate the volatility spillovers among commodities, equities and socially responsible investments, underpinning their dynamic correlations during the economic instability wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated financial crises. Design/methodology/approach This research quantitatively analyzes volatility transmission across various financial assets from January 2005 to October 2020 by employing the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) spillover index. The methodology incorporates a temporal examination to capture the evolution of volatility dependencies pre and post the emergence of COVID-19. Findings The findings indicate substantial volatility spillovers among the assets in question, aligning with the current financialisation of commodity markets and a rise in financial market integration. These spillovers also show variation over time. Notably, the interconnectedness among the assets intensifies during periods of stress. For instance, the total spillover index significantly surpassed 80% toward the end of January 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, the results imply that financial markets appear to be segmented. Practical implications The findings afford investors a more comprehensive insight into both the character and scale of the interdependencies across a broad array of financial markets. Indeed, grasping the extent to which financial markets are segmented or integrated during times of stress and stability is crucial for investors. Such understanding is key to more accurately evaluating risks, diversifying investment portfolios and devising more efficient hedging strategies.

Asymmetric connectedness and investment strategies between commodities and Islamic banks: Evidence from gulf cooperative council (GCC) markets,"The study uses the data of thirteen Islamic Banks (IB) in the GCC region and sixteen commodities that include soft agriculture, energy, industry, and precious metal commodities. Murabaha transactions makes up most of the revenues of the Islamic banks, whereas commodities set up the biggest portion of the assets among Murabaha transactions, therefore commodities and IB revenues are expected to comove. Interestingly, empirical findings suggest that most of the Islamic banks and commodities are not significantly affected by the shocks from other markets. We further observe that negative shocks have a higher impact on market connectedness among used assets compared to the positive returns and find a significant role of risk variables in explaining the magnitude of spillover between used assets. We perform robustness of our results in sub-samples periods during Shale Oil Revolution, Global Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19. Additionally, the multivariate portfolio analysis shows some risk reduction properties of the majority of the used assets. The performance evaluation measures demonstrate that weights selected based on dynamic connectedness network presents diversification opportunities. These findings help investors and portfolio managers to remain alert to the movements of the risk factors and calibrate there hedging and portfolio management strategies by taking long and short positions as incorporation of Islamic banks and commodities in the GCC region in a portfolio could yield risk reduction benefits and profitability.",2024-05-27,
Does Financial Derivative Hedging Reduce Firms’ Financial Constraints?,"This study examines the relationship between the firms’ derivative risk management and its financial constraints. Firms face a wedge between their internal and external financing for their investments. I test whether this wedge reduces firms’ financial constraints when they hedge using interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity derivatives. Using an event study and a difference-in-differences framework around implementing Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 123R, this study shows a strong causal relationship between derivative hedging and financial constraints. I find that net debt increases for the derivative hedging firms, on the other hand, cash holdings and net equity issuance decreases. When managers of non-financial corporations believe that their firm will face a liquidity shortage, they save more cash out of cash flow as a precautionary measure. Both cash flow-cash sensitivity and investment-cash flow sensitivity decrease. The analysis also shows that both the loan spread and the probability of covenant violation decrease after firms start derivative hedging. The main implication of the analysis is that risk management influences the asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers: the increase in risk management, the less the asymmetry.",2024-05-27,

"Dynamics effect of volatility index, interest rates, and commodity prices on Indonesian bond yields","Several factors influence the movements and dynamics of bond yields in financial markets. The determination of monetary policy, specifically the decisions regarding interest rates made by central banks, is a critical factor. Moreover, bond yields can be influenced by various factors such as geopolitical events, financial volatility, market sentiment, and investor risk appetite. These factors can impact the demand and supply dynamics in bond markets. This research aims to analyze the influence of Interest Rates, IDR to USD Exchange Rates, Volatility Index (VIX), Gold and Oil Prices on Bond Yields in Indonesia. The data used in this research is secondary data, which consists of time series data from 2019-2023. This research investigates the impact of financial and commodity prices on bond yields in Indonesia by using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to examine both the long-run correlation and short-run effect. Empirical results found that Interest Rate, Volatility Index (VIX), and Oil Prices have a significant positive influence. Meanwhile, the Gold Price variable has a significant negative influence. This research has several crucial policy implications for investors concerning the national monetary policy, exchange rate fluctuation, and global volatility index to create profitable and sustainable portfolio strategies.

What makes consumers buy from the informal rather than formal retail market? A consumption value perspective,"Purpose This paper aims to understand consumption values buying from informal retail markets (i.e., street vendor retailing). It also explores why consumers prefer daily necessary goods from the informal compared to the formal retail market (such as supermarkets, retail chain outlets and e-commerce). Design/methodology/approach Employing the qualitative research approach, this study collected data from nine respondents in two areas in Malaysia. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using the thematic analysis technique. Only representative verbatim codes were presented under five themes of consumption value theory. Findings Consumers are triggered by the convenience, ease, and exclusive products (conditional value), friendly and known relationship with informal sellers, as well as the availability of some particular food items (emotional value) and lower price and freshness of groceries (functional value) while buying from informal compared to formal retail vendor. Research limitations/implications This study provides knowledge implications to the consumption value theory. Functional, emotional, and conditional values are the dominant components of purchase behaviour in informal compared to formal retail channels. Social values are common, whereas epistemic value is more substantial in formal retailing. Practical implications Findings are helpful for informal retail businesses to understand consumers' buying behaviour. Informal retail owners should ensure that commodities are fresh, highly affordable and available in the local communities. Building a friendly relationship with consumers would be a key to the success of this retail sector. Social implications Authorities should support informal sellers to set up mobile retail stores in residential areas. This effort would offer greater convenience to both parties in informal businesses and ensure informal sellers' financial and social well-being. Originality/value Despite the widespread acceptance of buying goods from informal retail vendors, research on consumption value in informal retailing is largely overlooked. Previous research primarily deals with formal market phenomena due to their size and economic contribution. Consequently, current literature lacks an understanding of why consumers prefer to buy from informal retail vendors for their daily groceries when the formal retail channel could fulfil similar needs. Using a qualitative research design, this research uncovers consumers' buying motives from informal compared to formal vendors.",2024-05-24,
Agricultural manufacturers taxation in the context of food security: environmental and economic aspects,"The article examines the state, problems and prospects of taxation of agricultural producers. An analysis of the structural elements of the tax policy was carried out. The tax burden is calculated in relation to net profit, the area of agricultural land and arable land. The shortcomings of special regimes of taxation of domestic agricultural enterprises are identified. Directions for improving the mechanism of taxation of agricultural producers have been developed. The functioning of agricultural producers should provide for various state supports in the fiscal sphere, including the provision of certain tax benefits. The relationship between the taxation of agricultural enterprises and the effectiveness of their activities in the context of ensuring the food security of the State, as well as the environmental aspects of taxation, in particular the impact of taxation on the stimulation of environmentally friendly production and the use of land resources, have been studied. Recommendations have been made on improving the taxation system of agricultural commodity producers in order to increase food security and preserve ecological stability. The authors analyzed tax rates, benefits and burdens related to agricultural enterprises, which affect their financial situation and development. The article highlights the main aspects that determine the taxation of agricultural producers, and also takes into account modern trends and prospects in this area. The study helps to understand the complex aspects of taxation that affect agriculture, and also highlights possible ways to optimize the tax burden to support the sustainable development of the agricultural sector and draws attention to possible strategies for optimizing tax payments for agricultural producers aimed at increasing their competitiveness and sustainability in changing conditions market. Effective management of agribusiness is possible only under the condition of stability and predictability of tax legislation, which ensures the optimal tax burden on enterprises. The specificity of the agricultural sector requires special approaches to the taxation of business entities in this sector of the economy. Therefore, the problem of forming an effective system of taxation of the activities of entrepreneurial structures in the agrarian sector of the economy, including in order to ensure the appropriate level of food security of the state, is becoming actualized. Such measures consist in creating a favorable tax environment that promotes the development of the agricultural sector, increasing its production potential and increasing its contribution to the country’s economy.",2024-05-24,
Wavelet entropy and complexity–entropy curves approach for energy commodity price predictability amid the transition to alternative energy sources,"In recent years, energy commodities have emerged as pivotal and widely debated subjects, driven by their profound influence on the global economy and their intricate interconnections. Moreover, the challenges stemming from the predictability of energy commodity prices have become a prominent and intensifying focus of discussion. To this aim, in this paper, we employ wavelet analysis with an entropy approach to investigate and evaluate fluctuations, low-frequency events, and rare events in energy commodity prices and the consequent predictability of such time series. In particular, wavelet analysis can differentiate high-frequency from low-frequency movements in a time series, and entropy is a valuable mathematical tool used to evaluate the state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty in a time series. Specifically, we employ Rényi Entropy instead of the Shannon entropy because it allows for enhanced consideration of low-frequency events and spikes in a time series. Therefore, to analyze the predictability of a series, we use Wavelet Rényi Entropy (WRE) and the Rényi complexity–entropy curves by combining the wavelet transform with Rényi entropy. Finally, we apply our analysis to real financial data, including energy commodities and indices that can describe the transition to alternative energy resources.",2024-05-23,
Analysis of the Transportation Infrastructure in Sierra Leone and its Impact on Local Commodities into the Market,"Transportation infrastructure plays a crucial role in the economic development and growth of nations, facilitating trade and investment opportunities by enabling the movement of people, services, and goods across markets and regions. However, developing countries such as Sierra Leone face significant challenges in providing suitable transportation infrastructure to support logistics management. Inadequate upkeep, financial constraints, and limited access to technology hinder the development of transportation infrastructure in Sierra Leone. Consequently, logistics management, which involves the planning, implementation, and control of the movement of goods and services, is adversely affected, leading to delayed deliveries, increased costs, and decreased competitiveness in the global market. This study aims to analyze the state of transportation infrastructure in Sierra Leone and its impact on local commodities. To assess the impact of transportation infrastructure on local commodity supply in Sierra Leone, a qualitative approach was employed. The findings from the study reveal that poor transportation infrastructure particularly limited cold storage facilities along transportation routes can lead to the spoilage of perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables. The findings were supported by four important recommendations: investment in road maintenance and expansion, modernisation of port facilities, development of intermodal transportation hubs, and the promotion of public-private partnerships.",2024-05-23,
Risk Assessment of Banks under Fed Rate Hikes,"The global economy was hit after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic stagnation and high volatility in commodity prices also had a negative impact on global supply chains. The Federal Reserve, in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, slow down inflation, increase the liquidity of money, prevent asset value bubbles, and further revive and stabilize the economy, adopted a policy of raising interest rates, gradually increasing the federal funds rate to between 5.25 and 5.5 per cent over a two-year period. This change, however, also led to many changes in the banking sector. Commercial banks are trying to find ways to avoid risks while maintaining their returns in the face of financial market changes. This paper analyzes the systemic risk of commercial banks through liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk with the cases of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Credit Suisse Bank. Through the analysis, this paper finds that commercial banks suffer from systemic risk, often reflecting their own operational problems, which ultimately led to bankruptcy or acquisition of the end.",2024-05-23,
Agricultural cooperatives as subjects of agrarian legal relations,"The article is devoted to the study of the main trends in the development of agricultural cooperation legislation and to the clarification of the place of agricultural cooperatives among subjects of agrarian legal relations. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the process of gradual liquidation of agricultural production cooperatives, which began in the early 2000s and ended with the adoption of the Law of Ukraine dated July 21, 2020 «About Agricultural Cooperation». A comparative characterization of agricultural service cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives which operates without profit, also agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives which operates for profit, was carried out. The conditions for assigning «new» agricultural cooperatives to the group of agricultural producers are determined. The main directions of state financial support of agricultural cooperation are analyzed. The author came to the conclusion that the development of Ukrainian agrarian legislation shows a steady tendency to transform agricultural cooperatives either into processing enterprises or into business entities whose activities are primarily aimed at serving small commodity producers - farms. Thus, agricultural cooperatives are gradually losing the features inherent in agricultural commodity producers, which negatively affects, for example, on their number. This does not contribute to the implementation of such a business principle as ensuring economic diversity and equal protection by the state of all business entities (Article 6 of the Commercial Code of Ukraine), also ensuring food security of our country.",2024-05-23,
PENGENALAN DAN PELATIHAN DIVERSIFIKASI PRODUK HASIL PERIKANAN KEPADA ISTRI NELAYAN DI KENJERAN-SURABAYA,"The impoverished economic condition of fishermen is one of reasons that compelling the wives to work and earn extra living for their families. This problem is predominantly occurred in fishermen households in Kenjeran, Surabaya. This impoverished economic condition of fishermen is considerably influenced by the lack of adequate facilities and education related to the processing of diversified fishery commodities. Therefore, in order to help the economy improvement and reduce the poverty level within fishermen households, it is necessary to provide community service which is focusing on giving skill in diversification process of fisheries commodities. This activity aims to provide training and information enrichment related to fishery product processing skills in order to encourage financial independence in fishermen communities. This community service activity was initially began with conducting preliminary survey, which then continued with the training in making products from fisheries commodities. In the counseling process, primary data was taken by conducting interviews to fill out questionnaires. The result of this community service activity showed that the majority of participants already had certain level of understanding toward nutritional information and proper method to make processed fisheries products. The participants of this activity were given information regarding to the utilization of package in protecting and elevating the selling price of fisheries products. The questionnaires evaluation shows that the fishermen wives need further assistance regarding the variety of fish processing method, along with the effective marketing strategy and the proper implementation of sanitation hygiene to make products with high selling price. The Kenjeran fishing community understands the importance of diversifying fishery products. This is an effort to increase the economic value of products as an economic resource for residents.",2024-05-23,
Does “Paper Oil” Matter? Energy Markets’ Financialization and Co-Movements with Equity Markets,"We revisit, and document new facts regarding, the financialization of U.S. energy markets in 2000–2010. We show that, after controlling for macroeconomic factors and physical energy market fundamentals, the strength of energy markets’ co-movements with the U.S. stock market is positively related to the energy paper market activity of hedge funds that trade both asset classes. This relation weakens when credit risk is elevated. We find, in contrast, no link with the aggregate positions of commodity index traders in energy futures markets. Our findings have implications for the ongoing debate regarding the financialization of commodities.",2024-05-23,
IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF COMMERCIAL BANKS IN KENYA,"&lt;p&gt;Countries worldwide were gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic for the greater part of 2020 and 2021. COVID-19 spread to virtually all nations around the globe, causing a contraction of the global economy, and Kenya was no exception. Governments worldwide deployed social distancing, lockdowns, and curfews, which resulted in employee lay-off, business closure, and suppressed demand for commodities and services, eventually trickling down to commercial banks. The Kenyan banking sector experienced deterioration in asset quality which has been worsening since 2014 when it stood at 5.6 percent, reaching an all-time high of 14.5 percent in 2020 whereas Return on Assets which has also been declining since 2014, stood at 4.46 percent dropped to a record low of 2.07 percent in 2020 during the pandemic. This study, therefore, sought to determine how the financial stability of Kenyan commercial banks has been impacted by the COVID-19 shock. The study sought to specifically establish how both Z-score and capital adequacy of Kenyan commercial banks were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial intermediation theory, Capital buffer theory, and Financial Instability Hypothesis anchored the study. The research design embraced was non-experimental, while the financial stability proxy was Z-score. The study’s target population was 19 commercial banks in Kenya between the years 2015 and 2022, which had complete data on all the study variables. Annual bank-level data was obtained from Kenya`s Central Bank`s annual supervision reports from 2015-2022. Event study methodology was used while collecting data whereby, the event window was 2020-2021, the period before the event (COVID-19) was 2015-2019, and the period after the event was 2022. The study espoused a panel vector autoregression model in data analysis where the impulse response functions were generated. The researcher discovered that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted Z-score and capital adequacy. Based on the research findings, the Government of Kenya ought to institute non-disruptive pandemic control measures such as proper hygiene and wearing of masks as opposed to quarantines and lockdowns, which are detrimental to commercial banks' operations and other businesses, ultimately leading to a decline in income for commercial banks. Moreover, since capital acts as a shock absorber for banks, Kenyan commercial banks should strive to achieve and maintain the minimum capital adequacy ratios set by the Central Bank of Kenya. This will ensure that commercial banks in Kenya cushion themselves against economic shocks generated by pandemics such as COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEL:&lt;/strong&gt; E44, E58, G01, G21, G28, G32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=""/-counters-/edu/0227/a.php"" alt=""Hit counter"" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",2024-05-22,
Commodity cycles and financial instability in emerging economies,"Abstract Commodity-exporting economies display procyclicality with the price of commodity exports. However, the evidence for the relative importance of commodity price shocks for aggregate fluctuations remains inconclusive. Using Russian data from 2001 to 2018 we estimate a small open economy New Keynesian model with a banking system and leveraged domestic firms who default on their unsecured domestic debt. We show that allowing default rates to vary endogenously over the business cycle amplifies the estimated contribution of commodity price shocks. Endogenous default introduces time-varying wedges that amplify the response of commodity price shocks through demand and income effects rather than the relative price effects that are found in the country risk-premium, balance sheet, and financial accelerator channels. We find that the contribution of commodity prices to explaining fluctuations in GDP rises from 2.5 to 33.6% while for deposits and non-performing loans, it increases from 5.3% and 1.6% to 71.3% and 60.4%, respectively.",2024-05-22,

Shocks and global asset market connectedness,"This chapter analyzes volatility spillovers across the global stock, bond, foreign exchange, and commodity markets from 2007 to 2022 using the Diebold-Yilmaz connectedness methodology. The volatility connectedness increases substantially during periods of stress in global asset markets. Aside from the jumps in the connectedness index, it is possible to identify a long-run downward trend in the connectedness index from the global financial crisis through the end of 2017. Immediately after hitting a minimum level, the index followed an upward trend. This trend became more robust following the Covid-19 shock of March 2020, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the surge in inflation in 2022. Most of the sudden jumps in the volatility connectedness have been due to the increased connectedness across asset classes rather than the within-asset classes. Stocks are the asset class that generated the highest level of volatility connectedness to others, followed by bonds and foreign exchange. Commodities are the asset class that receives the most connectedness from other asset classes.",2024-05-21,
Managing risk and reaping rewards: Climate‐change futures as a game‐changer for energy futures markets,"Abstract Climate‐change futures provide a platform for low‐carbon portfolios and energy market risk hedging. Climate changes induce uncertainty in energy‐commodity markets. We investigate the potential of diversifying and hedging energy‐commodity market risk with climate‐change futures, using dynamic conditional correlation (DCC)‐ordinary least squares (OLS) incorporating quantile‐dummies and cross‐quantilogram (CQ) approaches. DCC‐OLS models reveal that the World and USA climate‐change futures exhibit that they can be diversifiers for oil, ethanol, gasoil, and gasoline. These futures also exhibit hedging features for natural gas, coal, and heating oil. Euro climate‐change futures demonstrate hedging capabilities for all energy commodities except oil and gasoil. World, USA, and Euro climate‐change futures have the potential to serve as safe‐haven financial instruments in the face of the high volatility of Brent crude oil, gasoil, and heating oil. The CQ reveals that World, USA, and Euro climate‐change futures exhibit hedging and safe‐haven capacity against oil, natural gas, coal, gasoil, gasoline, and heating futures. Climate‐change futures may protect financial investments during extreme volatility in energy commodities.",2024-05-20,
Towards an Active Role of Financial Institutions in Preventing Problem Gambling: A Proposed Conceptual Framework and Taxonomy of Financial Wellbeing Indicators,"Abstract The transformation of gambling into a largely digital commodity has created a need for online payment technologies to facilitate online gambling, thereby also raising the question of what role these actors can play in the promotion of Responsible Gambling (RG). With the means and access they maintain, financial institutions are in a unique position to alleviate financial pitfalls, yet their role in the gambling context has thus far received little scrutiny. The objective of this study was to conduct an extant literature review to develop an initial set of financial indicators tailored for financial institutions, enabling them to engage in the RG initiatives. We conducted a two-step narrative literature review to identify both general Financial Well-Being (FWB) indicators across financial research disciplines, and one specific to gambling. A literature search over the past 20 years was performed across the following academic databases: Medline (Ovid), Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Web of Science (Clarivate), and PsycInfo (EBSCO). Manifest content analysis was used in step one to review general financial well-being, yielding a general FWB conceptual framework. In step two, we applied latent content analysis to the gambling-specific literature, linking essential concepts of gambling-related financial harms to the broader FWB literature. This resulted in a tentative taxonomy of indicators applicable to financial institutions with gambling customers. In tandem with the FWB conceptual framework, the preliminary taxonomy could provide a foundation for financial institutions catering to gambling customers to engage in the duty of care agenda, potentially broadening player protection beyond the current operator-focused RG measures.",2024-05-20,
Financialization of commodity markets: New evidence from temporal and spatial domains,"Abstract To address the ongoing contention surrounding the impact of financialization, this study adopts a ripple‐spreading network model to analyze the transmission of information across 13 globally significant commodity markets. By juxtaposing the pre‐ and postfinancialization periods, notable disparities in spillover magnitude are discerned, with overall effects registering at 58% and 85%, respectively. Moreover, the postfinancialization period exhibits accelerated spillover dynamics, necessitating a reduced timeframe (less than 1000 units) in contrast to the prefinancialization period (approximately 2000 units). Furthermore, a heightened interconnectedness among energy, metal, and agricultural futures is evident in the postfinancialization period. These findings furnish compelling evidence regarding the ramifications of financialization on commodity markets.",2024-05-20,
"Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs): The Significant Role and Challenges in Indonesia's Economy","Abstract: Research Aims: The study aims to investigate how MSMEs—micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises—substantially impact Indonesia's economy. Methodology/design and approach: The design, methodology, and approach of this research entail an investigation of the noteworthy impact that micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have on Indonesia's economy. The strategy uses data to back up the assertion that MSMEs are the engine of Indonesia's economy, employing more than 97% of the labour force and adding more than 61% to the nation's GDP. The categorisation of companies based on their size and assets is investigated, demonstrating the numerical dominance of micro businesses to shed light on the structure of MSMEs in Indonesia; it emphasises how MSMEs perform comparatively poorly in exports, underscoring the necessity of improving their integration into international supply networks. Most of Indonesia's economic environment comprises Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs), making this sector a powerful force. This article explores how MSMEs significantly influence Indonesia and provides data to support this claim. MSMEs are the backbone of Indonesia's economic activity, employing over 97% of the country's workforce and providing more than 61 per cent of the country's GDP. Their share of the economy may appear little initially, even though they comprise 99 per cent of all businesses. Still, their reputation as crucial economic agents is cemented by their indispensable role in delivering basic commodities and services to urban and rural communities. The framework of MSMEs in Indonesia is further clarified by examining how businesses are classified according to their assets and size. Larger organisations have more resources and clout, while micro businesses predominate numerically. However, MSMEs need help beyond their financial relevance. It is imperative to address integration hurdles to promote innovation and productivity and to increase MSMEs' contribution to Indonesia's economic growth; policymakers can ensure that MSMEs continue contributing to Indonesia's financial resilience and prosperity by realising their critical role and tackling current obstacles. It will allow MSMEs to reach their full potential.",2024-05-20,
Stock Market and Cryptocurrency Price Prediction,"Financial market prediction has profound impacts on trading, investing, and risk management strategies. However, accurate forecasting of asset prices like stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex, and commodities remains challenging due to the complexity, noise, and non-stationarity in financial time series data. This project leverages machine learning to develop data-driven predictive models that can capture intricate patterns and provide actionable insights. Three distinct algorithms are explored - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for next-day price forecasting, linear regression for next-day forecasting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for predicting prices over a 1-week (7-day) horizon. Extensive historical data from major stock indices like S&amp;P 500, NIFTY 50, top cryptocurrencies, forex currency pairs, and commodities are utilized for training and evaluation. The models incorporate both technical indicators derived from price/volume data as well as fundamental factors and news sentiment obtained from sources like Alpha Vantage API. A rigorous methodology involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter optimization, and backtesting on unseen data is employed to ensure the models' robustness and generalization capabilities. Appropriate error metrics like mean squared error and directional accuracy are used for quantitative performance assessment. Additionally, interpretability techniques are applied to the LSTM models to uncover non-linear patterns and understand the key drivers influencing the forecasts. The overarching goal is to develop accurate predictive systems that financial institutions, quantitative funds, and individual investors can leverage for applications like algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, and data-driven investment decision support across different asset classes and market conditions",2024-05-19,
Classification of factors in an unstable economy that influence investment management decision-making,"в современной глобальной экономической среде, характеризующейся повышенной волатильностью, всесторонний анализ факторов нестабильности, влияющих на инвестиционную деятельность, приобретает критическую важность. Данная статья предлагает комплексный обзор ключевых факторов риска на различных уровнях: глобальном, национальном, отраслевом и корпоративном. Автор выделяет и подробно рассматривает такие фундаментальные источники неопределенности, как военные конфликты, процессы глобализации и деглобализации, а также коррупцию, анализируя их воздействие на инвестиционный климат и процессы принятия управленческих решений. На глобальном уровне военные действия, деглобализация и коррупция могут нарушить движение капиталов, торговлю, дестабилизировать рынки и подорвать доверие к финансовой системе, в то время как глобализация, способствуя свободному перемещению капиталов, одновременно ускоряет распространение кризисных явлений. На национальном уровне инвесторов сдерживают политическая нестабильность, изменения в регулировании и зависимость от цен на сырье. В отраслевом разрезе кризисные явления в отдельных секторах, обострение конкуренции и коррупция негативно сказываются на инвестиционной привлекательности соответствующих отраслей. На корпоративном уровне важны финансовое положение компаний, качество менеджмента и корпоративного управления. В статье также представлены рекомендации по инвестированию в российскую экономику: особое внимание следует уделять международным отношениям России, политической стабильности, ситуации в ключевых экспортоориентированных отраслях и финансовому положению отдельных компаний. Автор подчеркивает, что для принятия эффективных инвестиционных решений в условиях повышенной нестабильности крайне важны диверсификация активов, применение надлежащих стратегий управления рисками и рациональный подход к принятию решений на основе объективного анализа факторов неопределенности. in modern global economic environment, characterized by heightened volatility, a comprehensive analysis of the factors of instability affecting investment activity is critically important. This article provides an overview of key risk factors at various levels: global, national, industry, and corporate. The author highlights and examines in detail such fundamental sources of uncertainty as military conflicts, processes of globalization and deglobalization, as well as corruption, analyzing their impact on the investment climate and managerial decision-making processes. At the global level, military actions, deglobalization and corruption can disrupt capital flows, trade, destabilize markets and undermine confidence in the financial system, while globalization, by facilitating free movement of capital, simultaneously accelerates the spread of crises. At the national level, investors are deterred by political instability, changes in regulation, and dependence on commodity prices. In individual industries, crises, intensified competition and corruption negatively affect the investment attractiveness of the respective sectors. At the corporate level, the financial position of companies, quality of management and corporate governance are important. The article also provides recommendations for investing in the Russian economy: particular attention should be paid to Russia's international relations, political stability, the situation in key export-oriented industries, and the financial position of individual companies. The author emphasizes that for effective investment decision-making in an environment of heightened instability, asset diversification, applying proper risk management strategies, and a rational approach to decision-making based on an objective analysis of uncertainty factors are extremely important.",2024-05-17,
Trade and development in Africa,"This chapter explores the trade policies adopted by African economies in recent decades and the relationship between these policies and the state of economic underdevelopment still found throughout the continent. Today, the fact that most of the 54 African economies continue to mostly export primary commodities and import much else is a reflection of the lack domestic manufacturing that is necessary for raising wages and building the technical skills of the workforce over time. Just as the UK, US, EU, Japan, 4 Tigers, and China did in previous decades, African economies must also use their trade policy strategically to support the development of their domestic manufacturing sectors over time. Yet, today African economies face a range of challenges in the global trade and financial systems that inhibit their ability to use trade policy as an effective part of their development strategies.

American Catholics and the Quest for Equality in the Civil War Era by Robert Emmett Curran (review),"Reviewed by: American Catholics and the Quest for Equality in the Civil War Era by Robert Emmett Curran Maura Jane Farrelly (bio) American Catholics and the Quest for Equality in the Civil War Era. Robert Emmett Curran. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2023. ISBN: 978-0-80717930-7, 458 pp., cloth, $60.00. Given the title, this book was not what I was expecting—though the title tells readers exactly what the book is about. Robert Emmett Curran's latest, and possibly his most personal, contribution to the history of American Catholicism concerns ""American Catholics"" and ""the Quest for Equality in the Civil War Era"" but not, however, the quest of Catholics themselves to achieve some degree of equality on the American religious landscape. Rather, the book examines the reaction of American Catholics to the efforts of other demographic [End Page 85] groups—most especially Black Americans, with the help of their white allies—to achieve some degree of equality in nineteenth-century America. The reality Curran presents to his readers will disappoint anyone who believes that Catholics' historically marginalized status in the United States must have meant they were on the right side of history before, during, and after the Civil War. ""Catholics, as a community, had known, for generations, the consequences of being treated inequitably,"" Curran writes in his book's epilogue. ""But when the moment came to be part of a revolution to right the historic imbalance for everyone, most white Catholics could not rise above their tribal interests to treat equality as something more than a zero-sum commodity"" (380). Curran shares this conclusion after he has spent twenty-two chapters providing his readers with copiously researched details on how American priests understood slavery and the racial hierarchy that underpinned it; how the Catholic press, North and South, responded to secession and the Emancipation Proclamation; and why the involvement of Catholics in the plot to assassinate President Lincoln, Vice President Johnson, and Secretary of State Seward was disproportionately large. Readers learn that Lincoln lost the Catholic vote—overwhelmingly—in 1860. They learn that Catholic newspapers, even pro-Union ones, ""condemned the resort to any coercion to bring back the departing states"" (59). Readers are told that American bishops ""defended slavery as part of the order which is essential to civilized society"" and that Black Catholics in New York City had to write to the pope to get their priests ""to provide the same spiritual care for Blacks as they did for whites"" (40–41). Irish priests like New York's Archbishop John Hughes were particularly inclined to exhibit what Curran calls a ""tribal mentality"" that made them loath to serve their Black parishioners (41). ""Rev. Abp. Hughes … [hates] the black race so much that he cannot bear them to come near him,"" Harriet Thompson wrote to Pope Pius IX in 1853 (40). The result of Hughes's racial prejudice, Curran writes, was ""mass defections among African Americans from the Catholic Church"" (42). Curran has devoted his long and prolific career to writing about the American Catholic Church, and some of the information conveyed in this most recent book will be familiar to anyone who has read his older publications. Nevertheless, American Catholics and the Quest for Equality in the Civil War Era is different from any other book Curran has written, because it is a lament—the kind of lament that can be issued only from a place of love. The inability or unwillingness of American Catholics to recognize injustice in the nineteenth century and take a stand against it is finding new expression in [End Page 86] the politics of the early twenty-first century, according to Robert Emmett Curran. A majority of American Catholics voted for Donald Trump both times he ran for president, notably in 2020, when his opponent, Joe Biden, was only the second practicing Catholic to gain his party's nomination since John F. Kennedy. This Catholic support for Trump continued even after the January 6 insurrection. ""Catholic plutocrats, motivated by anti-abortion and economic libertarian convictions"" have provided ""the financial means to execute [an] antidemocratic revolution,"" Curran writes (383). ""Opportunistic Republican Catholics such as Elise Stefanik and Ron DeSantis...",2024-05-11,
Portfolio optimization based on network centralities: Which centrality is better for asset selection during global crises?,"We construct correlation-based networks linking 86 assets (stock indices, bond indices, foreign exchange rates, commodity futures, and cryptocurrencies) and analyze the impact of asset selection on portfolio optimization using different centrality measures (including degree, eigenvector, eccentricity, betweenness, PageRank, and hybrid centralities). In times of a global crisis, peripheral assets located in cross-market networks are more suitable for investment. By comparing portfolio performance based on different centrality measures, we find that (i) hybrid, eigenvector, and PageRank centralities can best improve portfolio performance; (ii) degree centrality is suitable for larger portfolios; and (iii) eccentricity and betweenness centralities are unsuitable for network optimization portfolios. In response, we explain them based on the construction principle of centrality measures. Additionally, our optimal portfolios suggest that investors pay more attention to the role of emerging countries, which are less exposed to external shocks and whose financial markets are more likely to remain stable.",2024-05-10,
Analyzing Crisis Dynamics: How metal-energy Markets influence green electricity investments,"The world continues to face major economic challenges due to crises that have a considerable impact on energy consumption. Since the global energy crisis, energy commodity costs have risen, and economic slowdowns in various regions continue to influence electricity market trends.Clean energy markets, propelled by the growing interest of economic entities and investors, are now interconnected with several commodity markets. In this context, energy metals play a crucial role in influencing the dynamics of the clean energy and particularly electricity markets. This study takes a close look at the complex interconnections between clean energy indices and the metals market, focusing on volatility dynamics. Drawing on advanced methodologies, including the Diebold and Yilmaz method, we unveil the complex relationships that link these markets. Our results reveal distinct patterns and interactions, highlighting the nuanced nature of the connection between clean energy indices and metal prices. The insights revealed have significant implications for policymakers and investors seeking to align their strategies with sustainable energy transitions and ensure financial stability. By enhancing our understanding of the interdependencies between clean energy indices and metals markets, this research provides valuable guidance for navigating the changing clean energy investment landscape.",2024-05-10,
Large Language Model in Financial Regulatory Interpretation,"This study explores the innovative use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as analytical tools for interpreting complex financial regulations. The primary objective is to design effective prompts that guide LLMs in distilling verbose and intricate regulatory texts, such as the Basel III capital requirement regulations, into a concise mathematical framework that can be subsequently translated into actionable code. This novel approach aims to streamline the implementation of regulatory mandates within the financial reporting and risk management systems of global banking institutions. A case study was conducted to assess the performance of various LLMs, demonstrating that GPT-4 outperforms other models in processing and collecting necessary information, as well as executing mathematical calculations. The case study utilized numerical simulations with asset holdings -- including fixed income, equities, currency pairs, and commodities -- to demonstrate how LLMs can effectively implement the Basel III capital adequacy requirements.",2024-05-10,
Aggressive Tax Planning and Performance by Kenya Revenue Authority,"Taxation is a vital fiscal tool that can be utilized to augment the economic wellbeing of a nation. Taxation is not only vital for revenue generation purposes; it can also be used to control the behavior of taxpayers such as raising taxes on commodities that are deemed to be toxic to the society, if over consumed. In Kenya, from Financial Year 2010/11 to Financial Year 2020/21 has recorded a deficit budget. A deficit budget implies that the economy’s leverage is weak. The country`s debt ceiling has now become a major issue, since the increase in national debt has surpassed the stipulated threshold necessitating adjustment of debt ceiling. Aggressive tax planning is vital with regards to revenue performance by Kenya Revenue Authority. This paper reviews the conceptual, theoretical and empirical literature and raises a variety of issues that necessitates a proposed theoretical model for the purpose of understanding aggressive tax planning and performance by Kenya Revenue Authority. This study aims at assessing the effects of debt shifting, location of intellectual property rights, bilateral tax treaty and performance by Kenya Revenue Authority. This research will be anchored on Social Learning Theory and Tax Competition Theory. This research study reviewed on the previous studies undertaken on the area of interest. This study focused on the study findings and the methodology. The conclusions regarding the relationship that exist between the independent variables and dependent for this study were derived from the findings of the past studies. Recommendations in this study were made based on the previous study findings and conclusions. This study found that Multinational corporations tend to exploit all the available loopholes within the tax laws in order for them to decrease their tax liability to tax administration. Due to multinational corporations adopting aggressive tax planning, the dire repercussions include tax revenues being collected by the tax administration tend to reduce significantly. This leads to tax administration not meeting their tax revenues collection targets. This study recommends KRA to continuously review any existing loopholes in the tax laws. Sealing the respective loopholes in the tax laws tend to enhance tax revenues collection targets. Further, multinational corporations need to observe ethics in their business practices.",2024-05-10,
Organizing milk harvest: A producer perspective on infrastructure and human resources,"One of the major considerations in operating a dairy production enterprise is the development and execution of a strategy for milk harvest. The production of milk as a business enterprise is generally governed by commodity based financial consid­erations. That is, the price of the final product is driven by the relationship between supply and demand. Both price and cost associated with the final product will be cyclical, and producers with lowest cost will, on average, gain market share over time just as those with high cost will lose market share over econom­ic cycles and may exit the business. Thus, the major consider­ation in organizing milk harvest is how strategic decisions will affect the final cost of the product. Some of the costs associated with the milking center can be considered direct costs while other aspects of the strategy can be considered indirect costs or opportunities. There are still other less tangible aspects of the harvest strategy that may not impact costs directly or indirectly at the milking center, but nonetheless have a bearing on what may be considered success in dairy production on a broader hu­man scale.",2024-05-10,
ANALYTICAL RESEARCH INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION MACHINE-BUILDING INDUSTRY IN CRISIS CONDITIONS,"Цель статьи заключается в определении тенденций и закономерностей стратегического развития отрасли с учетом современных условий хозяйствования. Исследование выполнено с помощью методов ретроспективного анализа и линейной регрессии. В результате исследования были выявлены направления наибольшим образом влияющие на развитие отрасли, наиболее динамично развивающиеся направления и деградирующие направления. Сформулированы направления поддержки отрасли государством. Выявлена необходимость пересмотра товарных групп расчета индекса производства. Оригинальность и вклад авторов состоит в том, что в исследовании впервые комплексно рассмотрена финансовая, социальная сторона машиностроительной отрасли и ее инвестиционная привлекательность за период 2017-2022 гг., а также выявлены зависимости между индексом производства и цепным темпом роста общего производства, между цепным темпом роста общего числа замещенных рабочих мест и цепным темпом роста общего числа организаций посредством метода линейной регрессии. Получен вывод о необходимости формирования комплекса мер по сопровождению замещения критических импортных товаров, дефицит которых возник из-за санкций 2022 года. Требуется пересмотр товарных групп для расчета индекса производства, особенно в секторах производства компьютеров, других транспортных средств и электрооборудования. Это поможет увеличить вес экономики государства и отрасли, повысив эффективность государственной поддержки. Показано, что необходимо также снизить конкуренцию в отрасли путем поддержки новых предприятий через упрощение бухгалтерской отчетности, налоговые каникулы и льготное кредитование. Сделан вывод о необходимости введения антимонопольных мероприятий в секторах производства транспортных средств поможет предотвратить нечестную конкуренцию. Также делается вывод о стимулировании использования инновационных технологий в производстве компьютеров и электрооборудования, а также обновления производственных активов через программы льготного кредитования и государственное финансирование, способствуют росту конкурентоспособности продукции. The purpose of the article is to identify trends and patterns of strategic development of the industry, taking into account modern business conditions. The study was performed using the methods of retrospective analysis and linear regression. As a result of the research, the directions that have the greatest impact on the development of the industry, the most dynamically developing directions and degrading directions were identified. The necessary directions of state support for the industry have been formulated. The necessity of revising commodity groups for calculating the production index has been identified. The originality and contribution of the authors lies in the fact that the study for the first time comprehensively examines the financial, social side of the machine-building industry and its investment attractiveness for the period 2017-2022, and also reveals the relationship between the production index and the chain growth rate of total production, between the chain growth rate of the total number of replaced jobs and the chain growth rate of the total number of organizations through the method of linear regression. It was concluded that it is necessary to form a set of measures to support the replacement of critical imported goods, the shortage of which arose due to the sanctions of 2022. A revision of product groups is required to calculate the production index, especially in the computer, other vehicle and electrical equipment sectors. This will help to increase the weight of the economy of the state and the industry, increasing the effectiveness of state support. It is shown that it is also necessary to reduce competition in the industry by supporting new enterprises through simplified accounting, tax holidays and preferential lending. It is concluded that the need to introduce antitrust measures in the sectors of vehicle production will help prevent unfair competition. It is also concluded that stimulating the use of innovative technologies in the production of computers and electrical equipment, as well as updating production assets through preferential lending programs and government financing, contribute to the growth of product competitiveness.",2024-05-09,
Cryptocurrency portfolio optimization: Utilizing a GARCH‐copula model within the Markowitz framework,"Abstract The growing interest in cryptocurrencies has brought this new means of exchange to the attention of the financial world. This study aims to investigate the effects that a cryptocurrency can have when it is considered as a financial asset. The analysis is carried out from an ex‐post perspective, evaluating the performance achieved in a certain period by three different portfolios. These are the one composed only of equities, bonds and commodities, the second one only of cryptocurrencies, and the third one is a combination of these both ones and thus made up of all considered “traditional” assets and the most performing cryptocurrency of the second portfolio. For these purposes, the classic variance‐covariance approach is applied where the calculation of the risk structure is done via the GARCH‐Copula and GARCH‐Vine Copula approaches. The optimal weights of the assets in the optimized portfolios are determined through Markowitz optimization problem. The analysis mainly showed that the portfolio composed of cryptocurrency and traditional assets has a higher Sharpe index, from an ex‐post perspective, and more stable performances, from an ex‐ante perspective. We justify our selection of the Markowitz approach over conditional VaR and expected shortfall due to their heightened sensitivity to unsystematic extreme events in crypto markets.",2024-05-08,
Volatility Spillovers among the Major Commodities: A Bibliometric Review,"The integration of commodities into stock exchanges marked a pivotal moment in the analysis of price dynamics. Commodities, essential for both daily sustenance and industrial processes, encompass hard commodities like metals and energy, alongside soft commodities such as agricultural produce. This paper investigates the implications of commodity price volatility on commercial and financial landscapes, recognizing its profound impact on global economies. This study employs a meticulous methodology, delineated into four stages: identification, control, and final selection of academic articles, culminating in their tabulation. Methodologically, a literature review serves as the primary tool for data acquisition, with a focus on existing scientific knowledge to bridge gaps and propose avenues for further inquiry. Drawing from reliable sources, including Google Scholar and Science Direct, the research navigates through a wealth of scholarly discourse on commodity market dynamics. By analyzing trends in academic publications, particularly focusing on the interplay between volatility spillover and gold, this paper provides insights into the evolution of research paradigms over time. Ultimately, this paper not only synthesizes existing knowledge but also identifies lacunae for future investigation, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding commodity markets and their ramifications on global economies.",2024-05-07,
China’s Strategic Lending Policy: Implications for Latin America,"China is quickly becoming the largest official lender in the world. For Latin America, China is overtaking multilateral lenders such as the World Bank as the biggest holder of debt in the region. When this is added to the trade relationship with Latin America that has grown rapidly in the twenty first century, initially driven by China's demand for commodities, the linkage between the two now goes even deeper. It further means that a potential stop to Chinese funding due to a domestic financial crisis would have an even more widespread impact on Latin America. This paper analyses China's overseas lending strategy and how it has deepened the relationship with Latin America. It then turns to the potential of a Chinese financial crisis and the significant implications for the Latin American region. The article concludes with policy recommendations.",2024-05-07,
APPLICATION OF LOGISTIC APPROACH IN MATERIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF ENERGY SUPPLY COMPANY,"The application of the logistic approach in the material and technical support of an energy supply company is considered using the example of joint-stock company ""Kharkivoblenergo"". Timely, high-quality, and complete material and technical support of productions are particularly important in times of war, as challenges such as the search for alternative sources of production supply, the shortage of goods produced by countries under sanctions, damage, or complete destruction of raw material productions within the country's territory, and the necessity of regular deliveries under shelling and destruction of logistic chains have emerged. Therefore, the use of a logistic approach in managing the material and technical support of energy supply companies with the formation of practical conclusions and recommendations that will be useful for the energy infrastructure of Ukraine in the conditions of Russian aggression is relevant. The purpose of the article is to apply a logistic approach in the activities of an energy supply company to determine the optimal location of a distribution warehouse, identify the largest suppliers and optimal structure of material and commodity values, and formulate recommendations to increase the efficiency of material and technical supply processes at the enterprise. The optimality of the location of the distribution warehouse of the company using the method of determining the center of gravity is assessed. It is found that the location of the current distribution warehouse practically corresponds to the optimal calculated coordinates. Using ABC analysis, the distribution of purchase volumes by suppliers and the structure of material and commodity values purchased by the company in 2023 is investigated. The largest suppliers of the enterprise by the volume of turnover and the optimal structure of material and commodity values are determined. An algorithm for the interaction of divisions of the company regarding procurement and supply of material and commodity values is proposed, which includes the following stages: 1) planning the annual need for the purchase of material resources; 2) organization of the process of procurement of material resources; 3) planning the monthly need for the purchase of material resources; 4) procurement of material resources; 5) delivery to storage locations and prompt inventory. The following measures are recommended to increase the efficiency of material and technical supply processes at the company: 1) involvement of employees of financial and economic services at all stages of material and technical supply; 2) improving the quality of procurement planning by technical and commercial services, which are the main customers of material and commodity values; 3) expanding the list of counterparties to reduce risks of non-performance of contracts.",2024-05-06,
High–low volatility spillover network between economic policy uncertainty and commodity futures markets,"Abstract Based on the formation and evolution of systemic risk, we study the high‐low volatility spillovers between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and commodity futures and identify the source of risk accumulation and risk outbreak, as well as the corresponding contagion mechanisms. Upon comparing topological characteristics on each volatility layer, our results demonstrate that high and low volatility spillover networks have different network characteristics and evolution behaviors. At the system level, high volatility spillovers are relatively stronger than spillovers in in low volatility network, while the risk propagation efficiency in the low volatility network is higher. At the market level, EPU is not only an important risk‐emitter but also a risk‐recipient most of the time. Additionally, compared with high volatility network, low volatility network characteristics have greater predictive ability for risk spillover among commodity futures, which means that it contains additional information and provides early warning signals for financial stress.",2024-05-05,
An Overview,"Australia's international environment in the first half of the 1990s was heavily conditioned by global trends that had gathered force over the preceding decade. Among these trends were the internationalisation of production and of financial and commodity markets; the emergence of a technologically borderless world, characterised by new media, information and communication networks and symbolised above all by the World Wide Web; and within this context of globalisation, the rise of new centres of economic and technological power, very notably in East Asia. The increasingly widespread influence of free (or at least liberal) market ideology could be seen as concomitant with these changes, in part reflecting them, in part driving them. And interlinked with these phenomena at the geostrategic level there was the waning of the Cold War. While the Soviet implosion of the later 1980s might not have ushered in any new world order, it did signify the demise of certain verities – including superpower ideological rivalry, strategic bipolarity, and nuclear arms racing – which had done much to structure the pattern of international relationships for four decades.",2024-05-04,

GLOBAL FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE MEDIATED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ISLAMIC CENTRAL BANKS,"The current global financial market, where money is based on debt, does not reflect a perception of wealth creation for inter-country life. The orientation of national income and expenditure has shifted towards debt. Citizenship has transformed into a consumerist lifestyle, and a country's economic policies have become dependent on the supply of debt. The financial structure of both nations and societies is created from one debt to another, with debt serving as the global financial standard. The Taylor rule links debt parallel to interest rates, transforming money into a commodity. Removing money from the current global financial market structure must be mediated by the establishment of a Shariah central bank under the supervision of the World Bank.",2024-05-03,
STUDY ON COMMODITY TRADING ANALYSIS AND INVESTOR’S PERCEPTION,"Commodity trading is as old as human civilization and one of the earliest economic pursuits of mankind. Over the centuries, commodity trading has evolved from the barter system to spot markets to derivatives markets. In barter system, goods were exchanged between two parties with matching and opposite needs (for example, bags of wheat were exchanged for cattle). Over a period of time, commodities brought from distant places were exchanged for gold and silver. With the introduction of Money as a medium of exchange, there was a paradigm shift in commodity trading with the value of commodity being expressed in monetary terms and trading in commodities was conducted mainly through the medium of currency. Commodity spot markets evolved in many places and the counterparties met at these common places where goods were brought for immediate sale and delivery at the market price decided by the demand and supply forces. In commodity spot markets, traders sell goods such as rice for immediate delivery against cash. At some stage, counterparties started entering into agreements to deliver commodities (e.g.: wheat) at a specified time in future at a price agreed today. These forward contracts, more often than not, were not honored by either of the contracting parties due to price changes and market conditions. A seller pulled out of the contract if the spot price was more profitable for him than the contracted price. A buyer also backed out from executing the contract on maturity if he was able to get the commodity at a cheaper price from the spot market. Futures emerged as an alternative financial product to address",2024-05-02,
Comparative Analysis of Various Machine Learning Models for Predicting Wheat Yield,"India's economy heavily relies on agriculture, with over half of its land, which is 328.7 million hectares, designated as agricultural land. Agriculture generates around 17.8% of India's G.D.P. and over 18% of its exports in 2022-2023. More than half of India's workforce is employed in the agriculture industry. However, the success of agriculture in India is affected by several variables like soil quality, crop genetics, and climate. Precise yield prediction is necessary for creating import-export policies, increasing farmers' income, and for agri-commodity strategic action plans. It is also required for field-level quantification and financial evaluation. Yield prediction requires proficiency in climate change, water, pesticides, land area, weather factors, and soil characteristics. Recent studies have shown that machine learning algorithms driven by A.I. can predict wheat crop yields in India and other countries with promising results. This study compares various machine learning methods, such as Naïve Bayes (N.B.), K-Nearest Neighbor (K.N.N.), Gradient Boost (G.B.), Random Forest (R.F.), Decision Trees (D.T.), Extreme Gradient Boost (X.G.B.), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The results revealed that the best yield prediction models were the Random Forest (R.F.) and Extreme Gradient Boost (X.G.B.) models.",2024-05-02,
The Archaeology of the Mediterranean Iron Age: A Globalising World c. 1100–600 BCE,"In 1983, economist Theodore Levitt first popularized the term ""globalization"" to describe an incipient era of free trade, increased mobility, improved communications technology, and growing worldwide demand for affordable consumer goods (Levitt 1983). Forty years later, we are still debating the merits and drawbacks of a globalized world. Some stress globalization's role in alleviating poverty, promoting mobility, and strengthening cross-cultural ties. Others argue that globalization has driven rises in inequality within and between countries, increased the impact and scope of financial shocks, eroded local cultures, and hastened ecological disaster.The Mediterranean in the first millennium BCE might seem distant from these twenty-first-century concerns. In The Archaeology of the Mediterranean Iron Age, however, Tamar Hodos makes a provocative claim: the concept of globalization, she suggests, is not only appropriate for describing ancient societies but can also generate productive new insights about Iron Age Mediterranean archaeology and history. This volume thus further develops a theoretical apparatus explored in the author's earlier work (e.g., Hodos 2010) and joins a group of syntheses that emphasize the connections between heterogenous microregions around the Mediterranean basin (e.g., Horden and Purcell 2000; Broodbank 2013; Manning 2018).Chapter 1 presents globalization as a framework that can accommodate both generalized, Mediterranean-wide trends and local developments. Because of this flexibility, Hodos argues that globalization has distinct advantages over previous approaches to Mediterranean-wide interaction, such as Braudel's longue durée, World Systems Theory, one-sided narratives of ""Hellenization"" or ""Orientalization,"" and postcolonial interpretations. The nation-states that constitute the major players in today's globalized world have no correlates in the Iron Age Mediterranean; rather, the key agents are defined as ""socio-cultural groups"" with ""shared traits associated with cultural identity"" (28). Hodos then identifies eight features of global cultures: time-space compression, deterritorialization, standardization, unevenness, cultural homogenization, cultural heterogeneity, reembedding of local culture, and vulnerability (29–30). Some of these, like ""standardization,"" have clear archaeological correlates. Others, like ""time-space compression,"" a term first coined by critical geographer David Harvey to describe the accelerated experience of life under late twentieth-century capitalism (Harvey 1989: 284–307), seem to me to be much more difficult to recognize in an Iron Age Mediterranean context.Considering the Iron Age Mediterranean as a whole requires reconciling archaeological evidence and chronologies across many different regions. In Chapter 2, Hodos emphasizes that the Iron Age's beginning and ending vary substantially across the Mediterranean and are often defined by localized political events or material culture changes. She identifies ""the spread of Phoenician and Greek culture across the Mediterranean . . . from the ninth and eighth centuries"" as the defining feature of the period (46) and sets the boundaries of her study at 1100 to 600 BCE.The remaining chapters use the lens of globalization to examine the movement of people, things, and ideas across the Iron Age Mediterranean. In Chapter 3, Hodos argues that ""colonization,"" rather than the more general and neutral term ""migration,"" is the best way to characterize the establishment of Greek and Phoenician settlements across the Mediterranean, as long as the term is stripped of the connotations of power differentials and inequalities associated with modern forms of colonialism. ""Greek"" and ""Phoenician"" are not internally homogeneous categories, as Hodos acknowledges, nor did overseas settlements passively reflect a mother culture. A helpful summary of literary and archaeological evidence for Phoenician and Greek activity across the Mediterranean follows (75–83), though the connection between distributions of Phoenician and Greek pottery and the presence of settled populations identifying as ""Phoenician"" or ""Greek"" could be considered more critically. Hodos resists overly schematic interpretations that see Phoenician colonization as motivated by trade and Greek colonization as motivated by gaining arable agricultural land. Instead, she argues that both types of colonies were interested in establishing local territorial control to provision their populations, supporting her argument with new archaeological evidence from Spain and Sardinia that suggests Phoenician interventions in agricultural hinterlands (88–89).Chapter 4, the longest chapter, focuses on the movement of objects across the Iron Age Mediterranean as a proxy for understanding social and economic networks. Hodos argues for a (gradual and uneven) emergence of commercial trade networks starting as early as the eleventh century BCE and accelerating throughout the period, with the concomitant development of a group of specialized traders and merchants. Shipwreck evidence attests to the importance of maritime routes for both long-haul and shorter local voyages. This connectivity can also be perceived in hybridized forms of material culture and cultural practices. Hodos's discussion of wine consumption and its social meaning in various western Mediterranean locales is an instructive example of how a single commodity could both shape local economies in various directions and draw some local actors into Mediterranean-wide networks (122–34). The chapter concludes with brief overviews of the movement of other commodities around the Iron Age Mediterranean, including oil, grain, textiles, enslaved people, and precious metals.While much interesting evidence is presented, Hodos's anecdotal style of argument often fails to ground broad claims in empirical data. This issue is particularly salient when it comes to the author's stance on the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age in the eastern Mediterranean and its economic and social effects on various regions: a scholarly preoccupation for decades. For example, we read both that ""in many places in the late second and first millennium BCE, the exchange of goods was much more restricted in quantity and distance than it had been previously"" (96) and that finds of Egyptian imports and imitations of Cypriot pottery from the site of Tel Dor in Israel demonstrate that ""regularized commercial seaborne exchanges and influences did continue over the end of the second millennium and into the first millennium . . . continued fieldwork and analysis elsewhere will help to overcome the relative scarcity of comparable contexts"" (97). It is difficult to situate the important finds from Tel Dor within larger regional or ""global"" trends without a more systematic assessment of the volume, type, and distribution of imports or imitations and how these might track with demographic changes (see, e.g., Murray 2017). Since a core claim of the book is that the Mediterranean-wide connections of the Iron Age ""eclipsed the previous interactions"" of the second millennium BCE in scale and scope (xiii), a methodical review of the relevant archaeological evidence for these connections in both periods is necessary.Hodos's brief discussion of slavery and the slave trade in the Iron Age Mediterranean (141–42) is a reminder that increased connectivity and mobility does not necessarily benefit everyone: as citizens of the global twenty-first century are well aware, surging flows of goods, ideas, and people can also create new forms of inequality. In general, the differential effects of ""globalization"" on different populations could be explored more thoroughly throughout the volume: as Ian Morris has observed, ""globalization has created winners and new losers; Mediterraneanization did the same"" (Morris 2003; see also López-Ruiz 2021: 7–8). Hodos's tone throughout reads as largely celebratory: the Iron Age is summarized as a period that is ""incredibly vibrant, dynamic, active, and rapidly changing"" (217). While this doubtlessly captures much truth about the multicultural Iron Age Mediterranean world, I found myself wondering: Vibrant for whom? Evidence for Iron Age slavery is admittedly sparse, but further work in this chapter and elsewhere about the new forms of dependent labor and social difference that may have accompanied increased connectivity would have furthered the analytical usefulness of the metaphor of globalization.Chapter 5 addresses the urban built environment. Hodos reviews the evidence for urban planning, settlement organization, and architecture from both the Phoenician and Greek homelands and their overseas settlements. Although Phoenician settlements in the central and western Mediterranean share certain formal characteristics and features, they also display internal diversity. The tophet (a ritual precinct for the disposal of child and animal remains), for example, is not evinced archaeologically in the Levant but appears to have specifically developed in a central Mediterranean Punic and Phoenician context (North Africa, Sardinia, Sicily, and Malta), with local variations and meanings in each of these places (161–62). The evidence for Iron Age Greek settlements is also summarized, though with some unusual emphases. The extraordinarily large and short-lived tenth-century BCE apsidal building at Lefkandi with which Hodos begins her discussion is hardly a typical example of Iron Age Greek ""urbanization"" (162–64): this building, which may have been a purpose-built funerary structure rather than a residence, has no known parallels in the Greek world. In discussing Iron Age urban developments, Hodos takes a middle ground: she rejects the idea that local populations passively responded to ""Hellenization"" and ""Orientalization"" but also stresses that the movement of Greeks and Phoenicians was a crucial stimulus for changes in the organization and architecture of settlements. This could involve either local engagements with or explicit rejection of external influences. Examples from Sicily, Sardinia, Gaul, and Iberia help to illustrate these points.Chapter 6 turns to alphabetic writing, emphasizing its role in both Mediterranean-wide communication and local identity formation. The Phoenician and Greek alphabets are discussed, with emphasis on the archaeological evidence for the origins, spread, and cultural deployment of these different writing systems. Not all Mediterranean regions embraced alphabetic writing. In first-millennium BCE Cyprus, for example, some agents continued to use a local Cypriot syllabary to write Greek and other languages as late as the Hellenistic period rather than adopting the Phoenician alphabet brought to the island in the ninth century BCE—a phenomenon that Hodos convincingly interprets as a deliberate and self-conscious act of regional self-definition. In the western Mediterranean, Etruscan, Tartessian, and Sicilian scripts provide further examples of how Greek and Phoenician alphabets were adopted and adapted to suit local contexts. The chapter concludes with two case studies of two inscribed artifacts—the Aristothonos krater and the San Paolo olpe—that testify to interactions between Greeks and Etruscans in the seventh century BCE.In the brief conclusion, Hodos returns to the eight criteria of global cultures mentioned above, reiterating that the Mediterranean Iron Age has ""all the hallmarks of modern globalization"" (220). The globalization analogy has been applied previously to the Roman Mediterranean, which was united under one political system during the Roman imperial period (e.g., Hingley 2005; Pitts and Versluys 2015). Hodos emphasizes that for the Iron Age, ""cultural aspects of material, styles, and practices"" motivate global connections (219; emphasis in the original). I remain skeptical that the term ""globalization"" is necessary to make the claims that (1) many regions of the Iron Age Mediterranean were connected by flows of people, goods, and ideas, and (2) different Iron Age populations participated in Mediterranean-wide or local trends to varying degrees. Moreover, I found that ""globalization"" did not provide a sufficient unifying theme for the volume. The number of regions and case studies discussed can be disorienting; marshalling this evidence to support more specific claims, rather than relying so heavily on the concept of a global Mediterranean, would have improved the book's clarity and cogency. Instead, some sentences are general to the point of meaninglessness: ""The 'complex' of connectivities within a globalizing environment derives from the fact that the connections between diverse groups are multiple in number and nature . . . The connections between connected communities can be complex"" (149).Despite these concerns, The Archaeology of the Mediterranean Iron Age pulls together much information and a wide-ranging bibliography that will serve as a helpful reference for those seeking to break out of ""scholarly siloes"" (xiii). Hodos's point about the unhelpful balkanization of the study of the ancient Mediterranean across multiple academic departments, raised multiple times throughout the volume, is particularly valuable (xiv–xv, 6–12). The fact that academic work on Greeks and Phoenicians in the early first millennium BCE takes place in different departments, is presented at different conferences, and is published in different journals is surely more a product of recent institutional and disciplinary history than of a commitment to better understand the ancient world. Yet it is also not necessarily feasible, or even desirable, for a single individual to become an expert in the archaeology of the entire Iron Age Mediterranean. Collaborative, interdisciplinary projects and edited volumes that synthesize the perspectives of those with deep local knowledge and that foster interdisciplinary discussion could provide one fruitful path forward (see, e.g., Hall and Osborne 2022). Whether or not one believes that globalization is a useful metaphor for the world of the first millennium BCE, successfully situating the difficult interpretive work of local archaeology within its broader geographical and temporal contexts should be a critical goal for all archaeologists and historians of the ancient Mediterranean.",2024-05-01,
Reprint of “Unveiling the dance of commodity prices and the global financial cycle”,"We examine the impact of commodity price changes on the business cycles and capital flows in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), distinguishing between their role as a source of shock and as a channel of transmission of global shocks. Our findings reveal that surges in export prices, triggered by commodity price shocks, boost domestic GDP, an effect further amplified by the endogenous decline of country spreads. However, the effects on capital flows appear muted. Shifts in U.S. monetary policy and global risk appetite drive the global financial cycle in EMDEs. Eased global credit conditions, attributed to looser U.S. monetary policy or lower global risk appetite, lead to a rise in export prices, higher output, a decrease in government borrowing costs, and stimulate greater capital flows. The endogenous response of export prices amplifies the output effects of a more accommodative U.S. monetary policy while country spreads magnify the impact of shifts in global risk appetite.",2024-05-01,
Food price inflation nowcasting and monitoring1,"Rising food prices may rapidly push vulnerable populations into food insecurity, especially in developing economies and in low-income countries, where a substantial share of the financial resources available to the poorest households is spent on food. To capture soaring food prices and help in designing mitigating measures, we developed two complementary products: a nowcasting model that estimates official food consumer price inflation up to the current month and a daily food price monitor that checks whether the growth rate of a few basic food commodities exceeds a statistical threshold. Both products were designed with the consideration that the rapid acquisition of data and the automated extraction of insights are indispensable tools for policymakers, particularly in times of crisis. Our framework is characterized by three key aspects. Firstly, we leverage two non-traditional data sources to emphasize the importance of real-time information: a crowdsourced repository of daily food prices and textual insights obtained from newspapers articles. Secondly, our framework offers a global perspective, encompassing 225 countries and territories, which enables the monitoring of food prices dynamics on a global scale. Thirdly, results are made accessible daily via an intuitive and user-friendly interactive dashboard.",2024-05-01,
A Small Piece of Red Sky to Fly In,"A specter is haunting transgender studies—the specter of Marxism. Recent years have seen the emergence of numerous trans scholars, militants, and organic intellectuals championing the centrality of Marxist analyses of social life to a thorough systemic understanding of trans subjectivity, oppression, and liberation. The appearance of queer and trans studies journals with a renewed interest in historical materialism, such as Pinko and Invert, testifies to the increasing consolidation of the field of transgender Marxism (which gives its name, indeed, to a collective volume edited by our comrades Jules J. Gleeson and Elle O'Rourke [2021b]). Beginning from the Marxist premise that no aspect of life under capitalism, including sex, sexuality and gender, exists in isolation from the mode of production, trans Marxism considers how capital intertwines with trans life—through the medicalized and carceralized regulation of bodies, differentiated experiences of exploitation in labor, the ubiquity and material power of the normative family structure—and how this can be collectively overcome.While we pen this answer to the question, Why trans Marxism?, the capitalist forces of dispossession, irregularly distributed around an international, gendered, and racialized division of labor, sow terror among the world proletariat. As you read this page, imperialist war and colonial occupation are marking the lives of the working class and the undercommons as ungrievable in Palestine, in the Congo, in Lebanon, in Yemen, and in the oceans that guard fortress Europe. The borders of Mexico and the immigration detention centers of the West have systematized the forced separation and murder of migrants for the mere fact of being migrants. The death throes of the world power that was the United States spread the economy of war in the Pacific and the South China Sea. The native peoples of Abya Yala face a process of plunder and forced displacement to oil the cogs of mass production and the monopolistic tendencies of goods; the Southern Cone remains suffocated by debt. The far Right and the process of fascistization eat away every day at the illusory sense of freedom within the bourgeois democracies of the global North. The reproduction of the contradictory and moving totality of capitalist social relations has frenetically accelerated the ecosocial crisis, leaving in its wake a world in flames, metaphorically and literally.But where the structural oppression of racisheterocapitalism manifests, there throbs the collective pulse of the insurgency. As we write, the Argentine working class overflows the streets in a national strike against the securitarian neoliberal authoritarianism of their president, Javier Milei; the roads of Chicago and the ports of the Red Sea come to a halt in internationalist solidarity with the liberation of the Palestinian people; the housing unions of Barcelona squat entire blocks of tourist apartments in the face of speculation by banks and vulture funds. As we write, the Naxalite guerrillas and the Communist Party of the Philippines are testing the hypothesis of socialism in their liberated territories. As we write, tens of thousands of people are marching through the streets of Berlin against the rise of the ultranationalist party Alternative für Deutschland. A viral video shows protesters chorally singing the verses of La Varsoviana: ""¡A las barricadas, a las barricadas! ¡Asaltad el mundo, trabajadores!"" Legend has it that this song, the union anthem of the anarchist revolutionaries of the Spanish state, reached the ranks of the CNT-AIT through the visit of a German militant who used to sing it in the bathtub.1 Intimacy, too, is a territory of reproduction for capital, as well as a potential site of its antagonism. As Marxists, the entirety of social life in its becoming is a kernel of class struggle.The skeptical reader may be wondering what precisely all this has to do with trans. We could certainly have mentioned the significant participation and leadership of queer and trans people in the union struggles against Starbucks; in the self-organization of sex workers toward decriminalization; in boycott, divestment, sanctions (BDS) campaigns against the state of Israel and in collectives such as Al Qaws challenging homonationalist pinkwashing; in ecosocialist assemblies; in prison- and police-abolitionist Black Lives Matter (BLM) movements; and in the movements of rupture and self-criticism within the traditional communist parties of Latin America and their Stalinist legacy. We could, and yet we would not feel ourselves to have scratched the surface of antibourgeois abundance that we envision in trans. We could, of course, highlight the moral panic facing trans and nonbinary youth in the imperial core, the attempt by certain states to prohibit the public manifestation of drag and gender dissidence in the sight of children, increasing institutional obstruction to accessing desired health care, and the imposition of nonconsensual interventions on intersex children and on any body whose existence challenges the naturalized canon of white capitalist, cisheteronormative, and productivist hegemony. We could, and yet we would not be fully realizing the horizon that trans Marxism opens up.Transness presents itself today as a battlefield, both in and against. On the one hand, trans* as a category contains epistemic limitations, since its genealogy leads us to a specific time and place, being an experience situated through specific biomedical practices (with its corresponding subjectivization from suffering) that operates solely within the framework of the modern/colonial gender binary (Lugones 2007) under capitalism. In this sense, as many contributors to this journal have argued, trans* runs the risk of becoming an analytical tool in the service of racial capitalism and new exclusionary forms of normativity and citizenship. Radical transfeminist activist and academic Nat Raha (2015) termed trans liberalism the set of policies and discourses that consider obtaining rights for trans people (understood as a private, self-contained identity) within capitalist colonial society to be the solution to our oppression, without questioning that its roots spring from the very social relations that determine the production and reproduction of life under the present state of things.Trans liberalism, by naturalizing gender identities as they take their spontaneous form within capitalism, strips of historicity the categories that cross and give meaning to our bodies. Trans Marxist theorist Nathaniel Dickson (2021: 208) points out that ""as transgender people, we must work to prove that our genders preexist the work we do to produce them and make them legible to others,"" thus reproducing an embodied form of commodity fetishism: ""Commodities are imbued with a mythical relationship to one another that bears no trace of the labour of human beings. In just the same way, gender is imagined as having an explanation that bears no trace of human effort. Our efforts, it seems, can only verify a truth that stands outside of history. Tools are not used to make gender, but to reflect it."" Trans inclusion within the framework of neoliberal states further operates as a living process of encapsulation: ""Trans people must be content to have their documents (or their bodies) checked when requested, which normalises the violence enacted through such checks . . . the nominal equality of rights hides individualised forms of duress, administrative violence, divestment/disinvestment and dispossession"" (Raha and Van der Drift 2023: 13–14). Dan Irving (2012: 158) analyzes how transness under a neoliberal regime of accumulation is ""constructed as an entrepreneurial project of the self"" through discourses that frame transition in terms of neoliberal self-optimization, justifying antidiscrimination workplace policies and health care coverage by ""marketing trans people as valuable employees"" (161). Truncated analyses that abstract transness from material, historical relations of oppression and exploitation in the service of establishing a ""transnormative subject"" (Haritaworn and Snorton 2013) are thus assimilated all too smoothly into hegemonic discourses, instrumentalized to serve the capitalist and (neo)imperialist interests and projects of dominant regimes.Faced with this, our conception of trans is articulated as a collective and expansive practice of negativity against the sex/gender dialectic in its capitalist form. We declare ourselves heirs of the conception of transgender advanced by trans communist militant Leslie Feinberg (1992: 5), as ""people who challenge the gender boundaries constructed by 'man,'"" as well as the proposal of trans historian Susan Stryker (2007: 60) to include under the term any phenomenon that denaturalizes normative gender and draws our attention to the processes that produce normativity. Faced with the confinement and the petrified appearance of capitalist social relations, trans takes the shape of an abolitionist fluidity. This is why, in our opinion, an analysis of the subjectivization of specifically trans people is only one element of the political necessity of a trans Marxism; trans life itself reveals nothing less than the bodily manifestation of a broader struggle for the reconfiguration of the human toward the coordinates of socialism.Defining the ""subject"" of trans studies has been an area of protracted debate, not least in this very journal. Attuned to the problematics of defining this subject, many theorists of trans studies opt instead for what has been called a ""subjectless critique,"" envisioning trans less as a delimitable subject, object, or predicate than as a particular methodology. Toby Beauchamp, for example, advocates for ""trans studies as a mode of analysis,"" for ""trans as a mode of critique rather than a specific subject position"" (Aizura et al. 2020: 136), while Stryker (2019) argues that ""trans studies has a method, even if its object is fuzzy and undefined. Understanding trans as method—trans as a dynamic, prefixial concept attached to other things—that's where the deepest critical action is."" In the attempt to avoid ""claiming"" particular subjects in potential capitulation to dehistoricizing, colonial, or taxonomical frameworks, however, the very subjectlessness of this critique often facilitates a detachment from the realm of present social reality that is itself dehistoricizing—and, indeed, depoliticizing. We offer a methodology of trans Marxism that refuses to capitulate to a subject/subjectless binary, reconstituting that binary instead as a dialectical relation; a movement that continually returns to the contradictory historical conditions through which ""trans"" is materially (and) symbolically constituted, even as it works to overturn and transcend those conditions.As Jamie C. Gagliano and Alexander Liebman précis in this issue, ""Grounded in the classed and raced struggles of trans people for collective emancipation, transgender Marxism develops a blistering critique of rights-based recognition, hetero- and homonormativity, apoliticized science, and how the biological family has been entrenched as the site of reproductive care to ameliorate the precarity and failures of financial capitalism""—and much more besides, as the contributions to this special issue demonstrate. The subject of trans Marxism is no less expansive than the totality of social relations under capitalism, and we must take up the mantle of denouncing and resisting the fragmenting forces that seek to privatize trans struggle to the concerns of a depoliticized interest group. Everything that sustains our proletarianized queer, trans, and nonbinary lives in conflict with capitalist social reproduction forms a particular moment of the red insurgency, just as do strikes at the direct point of production or mass protests against a world that we no longer wish to reproduce. A trans Marxist analysis compels and is compelled by Feinberg's (1998: 135) declaration, ""What are the goals of trans liberation? If you ask me, the aim should not fall a yard short of genuine social and economic liberation for everyone.""Trans is a collective action, not a privat(iz)e(d) ontology. In the flow of the socialized hormones, inherited binders, precarious housing situations, and erotic and militant pleasures that we share, those verses from La Varsoviana also sound. We wish to present, therefore, echoing our comrades Nat Raha and Grietje (River) Baars (2021: 3), the (merely) cultural and the economic as inextricable, such that the meanings encoded in trans and queer bodies produce positionalities within a racialized and gendered division of labor. The liberation open to all the dispossessed of the earth that trans Marxism pursues today was always part of the centrality of the class struggle, because our tools not only to interpret but also to transform reality never pointed merely toward a minority of people. ""Like transsexuality itself,"" wrote gay liberationist revolutionary Mario Mieli (2018: 255), ""the revolutionary movement is one and multiple."" We want to build a new commons, a diverse trans* totality capable of deposing the present.***The contributions to this special issue answer the question, Why trans Marxism?, in interesting and interdisciplinary ways. Wren Ariel Gould addresses the question directly in relation to analyses of the present legislative backlash against trans people in the United States, while Jamie C. Gagliano and Alexander Liebman make the case for the fruitfulness of introducing trans Marxism to the field of agrarian studies. JD Fulloon and Westley Montgomery use their individual Marxist critical-theoretical lenses to investigate trans cultural production, demonstrating their mutual suitability and the usefulness of Marxist concepts, such as reification and alienation, for trans cultural studies. Alex Adamson, Alexis Davin, Eric Llaveria Caselles, and Bruno Monfort each weave together Marxism and trans studies to make dialectical theoretical contributions to some of the key questions in trans Marxism: What is the value of the etiological question for trans politics, and how should it be approached? How does abjection shape the interaction of gender and value to determine differential disvaluations of trans labor? How can an immanent critique of gender and sexual identity forms within capitalist social relations and biomedical regimes apprehend points of intertwining without either holding the two in binary distinction or collapsing them into one another—thus leaving space for agency and for trans revolutionary possibility? Can Marxism provide the dialectical key to rescuing trans negativity from trans nihilism?Together the articles in this special issue weave a tapestry of fundamental concepts for those wishing to understand the relevance of Marxism for trans studies, and the relevance of transness to Marxism. The strength of the threads that bind the two is evident throughout this issue—so much so that, for the task of introducing each piece, a mind map might be more appropriate than a monograph. Nevertheless, we have attempted below to tease out these core concepts in turn, introducing and explaining them alongside outlining one or more of the articles that centrally instrumentalize them.In recent decades, neoliberal hegemony and a weakened Left have conditioned an LGBT(Q)+ activist politics structured by goals that remain within the framework Nancy Fraser (1995) terms ""affirmative"": ""Remedies aimed at correcting inequitable outcomes of social arrangements without disturbing the underlying framework that generates them."" Due in part to the population of mainstream LGBTQ+ ""movements"" by third-sector equality, diversity, and inclusion organizations and departments, whose funding depends legally on their segregation from politics as such, the ""awareness campaign"" often takes prevalence in trans activism over and above any view to transformative change in material, social, and economic conditions: ""Our domination by state bureaucracy, by landlords and employers, is often enough treated as a given, to be reclad with sensitivity training workshops and pronoun go-rounds"" (Gleeson and O'Rourke 2021a: 5). As Alexis Davin summarizes in this issue, ""The configuration of gender in the age of mass liberal trans politics demands locating the trans individual as a civil subject, devoid of preexisting political content except for a lack of specific legal protection and recognition, and therefore similarly amenable to citizenship and formal equality as all others.""The dissemination of the identity-political into the broader social fabric has taken place within a ""postpolitical"" historical moment characterized by what Mark Fisher (2009) termed ""capitalist realism"": the defanging of social movements' transformative potential within a social atmosphere incapable of imagining any noncapitalist future, where history is reshaped to naturalize neoliberalism as the culmination of human society. The increasingly globalized antitrans backlash, however, disrupts liberal presumptions of linear social progress, revealing the susceptibility of identity-based rights and social tolerance to the vicissitudes of power. This whiplash between tipping point and moral panic has boxed trans people and movements into a traumatic cycle of defense. However, as Federico Zappino argues, ""If we conceive of our problems as entirely limited to questions of morality, we limit ourselves to understanding our fight as connected to a transformation of relations of recognition, rather than relations of production, consumption, occupational segregation, distribution and redistribution"" (quoted in Petrachi 2020). Rather than recapitulating to essentialism and rehashing old strategies, we need to break free from the cage of moral panic in order to weave new dialectical understandings of the place of trans subjectivity and politics within the broader totality of capitalist social relations.Wren Ariel Gould's ""Coconstructing (Trans)Capitalist Realism"" forcefully demonstrates the utility of Marxist analysis for understanding the forces determining trans people's subjectivization—and the dangerous foreshortening of a trans politics that elides the horizon of capital. Gould analyzes the wave of legislative backlash currently impacting trans people in the United States, reviewing the many complex entanglements of trans life with capital and arguing ""that Post-Marxist theoretical tools reveal a catch-22 whereby legislative attacks consolidate late capitalism while provoking a (liberal, progressive) response that colludes in that consolidation the political danger of these legislative attacks lies not just in suppressing transgender communities, but also in shoring up late capitalism.""2 For Gould, the polarization of the political field between antitrans attack and essentialist medicalizing defense constitutes ""a trans capitalist realism in which trans anti-capitalism is rendered impossible.""The increasingly politicized conditions of trans life provide a particular vantage point on the ostensible contradictions of ""neoliberal democracy"": as we see transness, as biomedical technology and as drag brunch, wrenched ostensibly from the cogs of the profit machine and flung into the ghettos of criminalization, neoliberalism reveals its authoritarian face. But to analyze legislative transphobia toward a critique of the state without an equally attentive critique of the contradictory workings of capital produces a foreshortened analysis that sees private profit as a haven rather than a vampire: ""These critiques overlook the neoliberal context, that venues receiving state funding are obliquely targeted by these measures, in favor of a critique of authoritarianism that excepts the market pressures driving neoliberal authoritarianism."" Gould cautions against the susceptibility to the same capitalist forces—bedecked in progress flags and pronoun pins—of a trans politics that fails to center class in its analytical horizon and that thus (implicitly or explicitly) invests its vision of ""inclusion"" in both the market and the carceral state. This form of (wealthy, white, Western) trans politics, Gould argues, appropriates the vulnerability of working-class trans women of color globally while redoubling the oppression they face via the project of constituting transness as part of a ""respectable citizenship"" implicated in gentrification, increased policing, and participation in imperial violence. Marxist perspectives, Gould concludes, can provide ""a necessary corrective to an identitarian focus that overlooks political economy. . . . Indeed, Marxist critique may be imperative if transgender activists and advocates hope to win a more just world.""In his reading of Marx's 1857 introduction to the Grundrisse, Stuart Hall (1973) explicates the persistence of a theoretical tendency—one that, it is no stretch to argue, now holds instinctive sway in popular political consciousness—to understand the abstract as a theoretical transcendental, in opposition to the concrete of everyday lived experience. For Marx, the terms are reversed: the concrete, while still referring fairly intuitively to that which is ""objective"" and material—albeit with the caveat that no single object or relation can be concretely understood in isolation—is not empirically given. To conceptualize the complexity of differentiated, often contradictory relations, a certain abstraction is necessarily required of the thinking subject. What appears from a particular viewpoint as ""a deceptively transparent, natural, 'given' category"" is, in Marx, revealed in fact to be ""'concrete' only in a common sense way"" (33)—an ""imagined concrete"" that is in reality a necessary abstraction. In Holly Lewis's (2022: 71) words, ""standing in a particular location does not guarantee the capacity to interpret experience; rather, only the understanding of one's standpoint in relation to the whole can produce an accurate analysis of one's position."" Thus, the methodology of historical materialism consists in concretizing this necessary abstraction through a dialectical movement that systematically deconstructs and reconstructs it, ""decomposing simple, unified categories into the real, contradictory, antagonistic relations which compose them"" (Hall 1973: 34). One thereby returns to the now concretized abstraction ""not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and relations"" (Marx 1993: 100). In Marx's method, moreover, the original imagined concrete (and/or standpoint) appears not as a dehistoricized given from which analysis departs but as something to be analytically produced—as well as a condition of possibility for this very (re)production.Eric Llaveria Caselles opens ""Contours of a Historical Materialist Theory of Transsexuality: Claiming a Hopeful Origin Story as a Personal and Political Necessity"" by evoking instances of his own lived experience of etiological confrontation with medical gatekeeping and familial guilt: ""The answers I refused to give constituted me as a human paradox . . . [a] sense of self detached from historical and social relations—yet so dependent and vulnerable to them."" The invocation of this sense of conflict speaks to a contradictory space intimately familiar to trans people. In our individual and collective quests for bodies we can inhabit as livably gendered, we prop up the system even as we shake its very foundations, finding ourselves—as Gleeson and O'Rourke (2021a: 10) put it—""at once immersed and resistant."" Beginning from this experience of paradox, then, Llaveria Caselles proceeds through a variety of ""problematizations"" of transsexuality, dialectically engaging critiques and elements of each in a Marxian process of concretization. His elaboration of the necessary conditions for an alternate ""problematization"" of transness explicates historical materialism's core principles: the deconstruction and reconstruction of the symbolic order in terms of ""the material historical processes that engender and uphold"" it, and the need ""to theorize social reality not just at the individual level but also at the structural level, which can't be grasped through empirical means alone."" The goal of such a problematization, moreover, is praxis oriented: ""The analysis of the historical constitution of the transsexual in terms that enable the task of creatively developing visions and practices for collective emancipatory transformation.""In taking up Hortense J. Spillers's (1987) concept of ""symbolic substitution"" to argue that the biomedical problematization of gender and the notion of gender dysphoria ""insert in the realm of the individual and the psyche a conflict that resides at a structural and historical level,"" Llaveria Caselles intervenes decisively in the etiological debate, positioning the biomedical construction of transsexuality as such ""not as a site of origin but as a secondary sociogenic movement that overwrites the primary conflict and displaces it to the interiority of the individual."" The primary conflict—following Marxist feminism and social reproduction theory—""occurs in the space of the household and the market . . . in relation to conflicts of social reproduction specific to Western modernity and its articulation of a capitalist economy."" Returning to the lived experience of dysphoria in social-relational contexts from a structural point of view, then, recasts it as ""a practical destabilization of the gender order that puts pressure on its foundational contradiction and demands a reorganization of social relations."" Transsexuality precariously contains ""the possibility of defining the political field of gender at the level of its historicity, that is, the radical possibility of democratizing the organization of generativity""—toward ""gender self-determination as the collective political work of consciously imagining and practicing less violent ways of reorganizing the work of procreation and reproduction.""Alexis Davin's and Bruno Monfort's contributions provide rich and complementary considerations of value and its significance for trans life, elaborating the political-economic process of abjection through which the disvaluation of trans labor operates. For Marx, as Monfort notes, ""the methodological priority conferred on value starts from the recognition of its ontological priority in the organization of the totality of social labor."" The specificity of ""value"" in Marxist terms bears emphasizing. Value is the social form labor adopts; the exchange value of a commodity is determined by the total amount of ""socially necessary labor time"" required to produce it. Capitalism thus abstracts the particularities of both the subjective and the objective embodiment of labor to make it quantitatively exchangeable. Monfort explains that ""Marx warns us about the commodity form that its exchange value is not derived from its use value; rather it operates a process of abstraction operates that reduces concrete labor to its abstractly human and undifferentiated character so that it can be exchanged as equivalent in the market.""In ""The Political Economy of Sexual Identity: From Gender Performativity to Social Reproduction,"" Monfort demonstrates an explication of the importance of this specificity of ""value"" in his critique of Meg Wesling's (2012) ""Queer Value."" His appraisal of Wesling's analysis demonstrates the metaphysical pitfall encountered by analyses that fail to rigorously concretize their analytical points of departure—as described in the previous section on historical materialist method—in this case precipitating ""an interpretative turn in which the category of labor is erected as the point of view, and not as the object to be analyzed."" Wesling's determination that the queer gender performance of Cuban transformistas constitutes disalienated, self-actualized, and yet (or even therefore) value-producing labor thus blurs two levels of analysis: labor in its transhistorical sense as transformative human activity, and labor's specific organization under capitalism as the commodity labor power. Based on this elision, Wesling ""turns the reclamation of the social value of these structurally devalued activities into a political objective in itself""—thus attempting to transform the appearance of value relations while in fact further obscuring their material organization. ""Value-producing"" labor, in Marxist terms, refers in fact not to labor that can be considered ""valuable"" in a broad or moralizing sense—or even labor that contributes, without being directly market mediated, to the reproduction of capitalist social relations—but specifically to the production of surplus value: capitalist profit. ""The temporality of value,"" Monfort explains, ""is a kind of retroactive temporality in which the abstract labor objectified in the commodity is realized and incorporated only as an integral part of social labor in exchange""—that is, for Marx, the abstraction inherent in the commodity form means that value can differ only quantitatively, not qualitatively; the subjective nature of the labor makes no difference. Especially considering a critique of capitalist appropriation of queer and trans culture and practices as profit-making opportunities (see Gould's contribution), Wesling's purposeful blurring of the analytical distinction between value-producing labor, on the one hand, and disalienated social human activity, on the other, risks allowing the latter to be cannibalized by the former rather than rising as the revolutionary phoenix from its ashes.By what modalities, then, do gender and value interact within capitalism? First, for Monfort, a Marxian reading of Foucault demonstrates how the process of abstraction through which gender and sexual identity is constituted mirrors that of the value-form: ""The relations that constitute parti",2024-05-01,
Optimization of water distribution networks : a digital approach,"Water stands as the fundamental cornerstone of life, and with the human population growing exponentially, the critical importance of sustainable water management becomes increasingly evident. Water not only serves as the essential working fluid for major chemical processes, including thermal energy generation, but it is also integral to manufacturing and domestic use. Despite its significance, water is a scarce commodity, and the planet continues to lose this precious resource due to theft, pipe bursts, and leakages in water distribution networks (WDNs). The consequences of water loss extend beyond the impact on physical resources, as it is intricately linked to financial challenges. Thus, water loss has the potential to result in substantial financial setbacks for companies, organizations, and government entities, underscoring the interdependence of water management and fiscal sustainability. In response to these challenges, digital technologies have been harnessed to optimize WDNs. A major constraint lies in deciphering the applicable digital technologies due to the multidisciplinary nature of the research area encompassing WDNs and digital technologies; therefore, this study adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) combined with digital tools, to comprehensively extract all aspects of a WDN, ranging from sensors to enterprise resource planning (ERP), including equipment and systems. This literature forms the foundational basis for constructing a framework aimed at creating a content repository for digital WDN sustainability. To further develop the framework, this study reviews international best practices in digital WDN. This is adopted in developing a digital WDN framework based on the literature and classifying a database structure from sensor to ERP for a generic WDN. Furthermore, the study explores tools and systems for optimization as well as updating the theoretical structure with Johannesburg WDN data and provides a comprehensive evaluation for enabling digital WDN in South Africa. The digital WDN framework comprises three distinct components: security, a central management database (CMDB), and best practice architecture. The architecture involves five layers, including the physical layer, communication layer, data storage and analysis layer, benefit layer, and application layer. Utilizing systematic literature review and bibliometric keyword analysis, the study determines the equipment, systems, and their uses, leading to the development of a generic WDN. Validation of the framework using the generic WDN emphasizes the equipment and systems used in each of the five layers. Furthermore, the framework is validated using Johannesburg Water's WDN, leading to the development of a CMDB. The CMDB underscores the possibility of storing physical layer and communication layer configuration items (CIs) and highlights asset management, CI relations, change management, and historian capabilities. Maintaining an accurate and updated CMDB necessitates employing asset discovery solutions, while CMDB relationship mapping plays a crucial role in assessing the ripple effects of CI changes within a complex system. Finally, the measurement of the digital maturity of Johannesburg Water's WDN using the Administração e Gestão de Sistemas de Salubridade (AGS) maturity index reveals a maturity index of 62%. The index emphasizes strong capabilities in GIS integration and data collection through the SCADA system. Despite advancements in planning systems, such as domestic flow metering, there remains an opportunity to enhance asset management capabilities for continuous improvement in WDN operations.",2024-05-01,
Is It Worth Investing in Tokens? Investment Performance of Digital Tokens in Financial and Axiological Contexts,"Abstract The paper focuses on financial and axiological aspects of the new instrument in the digital economy, such as digital tokens (DTs). The purpose of the article is to examine the investment performance of certain types of DTs. We suggest a categorisation of DTs according to the types of assets that they represent and analyse them in terms of profitability, risk, and effectiveness. The investment performance of different types of DTs was compared with stock market indices and commodity prices. The empirical source of information is data from the coinpaprika platform from January 2018 to July 2022. It occurs that DTs demonstrate, on average, lower investment performance than traditional instruments. However, there is a wide group of the former that can be included in the portfolio as their investment performance is higher than the one represented by stock market assets. Our contribution comprises, first, the extension of existing research on tokenization and tokens to include the investment aspect. Second, we develop and apply the original proposal of DT classification, which takes into account the hitherto neglected aspect of worldview valuation of a given DT type by market participants.

Global Spillovers of China's Monetary Policy,"Abstract Spillovers from China's monetary policy have become increasingly obvious with China's growing importance in the global economy and its close economic and trade ties with the world. This study establishes a proxy structure vector autoregression model to investigate the magnitude and transmission channel of spillovers from China to global and regional economies, taking advantage of high‐frequency changes in asset prices in the financial markets to identify monetary policy shocks. The analysis reveals that China's monetary policy can affect the global economy by influencing international trade and commodity prices but there is no evidence of China's monetary policy affecting global financial variables. Tightness in China's monetary policy can cause a decline in world output whereas expansion in monetary policy can support global trade and output. This study also finds that the response of emerging Asian economies to China's monetary policy shock was nearly twice that of developed economies, while the transmission path did not change. The results of this study are consistent with the stylized fact that China's monetary policy plays an important role in the global trade and commodity cycle, although it does not drive the global financial cycle.",2024-05-01,
“But have we not always also been <i>all</i>?”,"The poet Mahmud Darwish was once asked what influenced his widely hailed innovation in Arabic poetic form and his turn to free verse. His answer was defeat: ""After 1948 we Palestinians who stayed in what became the state of Israel found ourselves in a state of defeat. It was a most perplexing time. There was nothing in the old forms of poetry that could help us express the state in which we found ourselves.""1 This state of defeat—the almost total loss of an entire life-world—upended existing aesthetic and expressive forms. There was just nothing in them that could even remotely approach the new historical reality. The imperative of revolutionizing the form of expression was not, Darwish added, studied or even deliberate as such; it was spontaneous, like a sudden but necessary leap of faith.How then do we, today, write the state in which we find ourselves? What are the forms, textual or otherwise, that might begin to express our broader defeat: the planetary catastrophe that is already here? How do we face catastrophe without eliding not only the endurance of the dispossessed but also their creativity and vitality, even their majesty? Can our writing—so often, let's face it, an experience of defeat itself—ever mediate these forms of life without capturing them within the conventions of academic decorum and legibility?Neferti Tadiar's Remaindered Life is a book deeply aware of its own relationship to history and form. I mean form here both in the writing itself and the forms of life it mediates. For all its historical consciousness, for all its insistence on the adhesive entailments of the long arc of colonial history, the book draws its forms from the present, from searching the current state of defeat. It doesn't close off the possibility of recovering any past tradition; instead, it stakes its conceptual leap on reinvention rather than recovery. The book neither tarries with contemporary antihumanism nor lets humanism off the hook; it squares up to the violence of dehumanization without appeals to humanity. We can see the insistence on reinvention in the conceptual tension right at the core of the book between the ""war to be human"" and the ""becoming-human in a time of war""; between, on the one hand, an indictment of the role that racial humanism has played in shaping the catastrophic present and, on the other hand, at once both a refusal to give up entirely on the anticolonial project of counterhumanism and an insistence that whatever promise that project carried has to be reinvented today. The question of what it means and what it takes to be human, Tadiar tells us, is ""at once urgent and too late.""2We see this grappling with form most of all in the book's affective discharge. This is a fierce book. But it's also a moving and moved book. It's a book of theory that also feels personal, even intimate. And yet it's never mournful or elegiac; somehow, it's heartbreaking but not somber. It's lyrical but always purposeful, politically incandescent, and totally committed to people—to her people, our people, to ""the becoming-human,"" to the descendants of the wretched of the earth (which is why it reminds one of nothing so much as Dionne Brand's poetry). It's a work that never shies away from just how bad things are; it takes on the fully catastrophic entanglements of the present—imperial war, financialization, gendered global servitude, mediatic platforms of capture, climatic collapse—without ever being nostalgic for what came before. So many of our reckonings with the present slide almost unknowingly, if understandably, into nostalgia for a recent past, any past: the welfare period, or some kind of genteel New Deal liberalism, or, more convincingly, the immediate independence period in the postcolony. But for all its insistence that the catastrophe at hand was only made possible in and through the violent closure of the promise of decolonization, Remaindered Life never casts its gaze backward in a longing for reenactment; there's no trace here of the sentiment ""if only it had stayed the same"" or ""if we only we could do it again."" The political conceptual grammar in the book emerges from the chasm now and from those lives that inhabit and exceed the chasm—disposable but always indispensable and never entirely captured. It's a grammar attentive to long history, to its unfinishedness, but a grammar that stays close to the terrain of contemporary struggle and life. A grammar that emerges from remaindered life, not as some research object but as a way of regarding, as ""a mode of attention or hermeneutic."" It stays close to the lived terrain of those who have already been catastrophied, already survived apocalypse, but whose experiences we were told were too particular and partial to tell us anything about the disaster that is now everywhere—""But have we not always also been all?"" (329).One of the principal concepts we've used to grapple with the wreckage of late capitalism (if that's what this still is) is that of superfluity. We know that the post-Fordist restructuring of global capitalism has produced above all not a surplus of social wealth, but a surplus of people. And by now we're well equipped with a certain critical vocabulary for thinking this through: ""surplus humanity,"" ""expulsion,"" ""organized abandonment."" And we can identify it, too, as both a structural and a historical feature of our contemporary accumulation regime; that is, not just the effect of cyclical crises (booms and busts) but also an effect of the historical restructuring and crisis of capital, a secular crisis—""a crisis of the reproduction of the capital-labor relation itself.""3 The historical conditions of the present—probably most decisively the historical stalling of the manufacturing engine of growth, but also the deepening of primitive accumulation and landlessness—mean that surplus populations are no longer reabsorbed in the same way, either in the city or in what's left of the countryside. What Karl Marx called the relative surplus population is becoming increasingly absolute. In turn there's no longer any direct equivalence between the category ""surplus population"" and the category ""reserve army of labor.""4In this image, our ""planet of slums"" seems teeming and overflowing with a mass of wretched humanity that has simply become structurally superfluous to both production and even consumption. Not a reserve army of labor but the absolute surplus of an ""outside"" to capital that is met with lethal disregard in the killing zones of the border regime or the dungeons of the carceral state. This is a surplus humanity that can never be absorbed: ""It exists now only to be managed: segregated into prisons, marginalized in ghettos and camps, disciplined by the police, and annihilated by war.""5 Pure discard.But is surplus to formal employment really surplus per se? Is the abandonment and rendering of vast swaths of people into waste really just a problem of containment and confinement? What if wasted life is not the antithesis of value, or even simply its precondition, but often its very operation? This is in part the proposition that Tadiar extends in her book. Value—understood here not as a thing or a fixed substance but a social relation and regulative entity at the heart of exchange and commodification—need not always pass through formal exploitation and the wage relation. The generation, or the capture, of value can come from the active wasting of lives. In this reading, the capitalization of lives and the expending of those lives are often one and the same. It's not just that life is labor; that insight is clear enough. But this is not what's at stake. We are not all just ""human capital."" At least not in the same way. ""Life as waste"" is in fact the inverse of ""life as interest-bearing capital"" that is the modality of the neoliberal subject (the digital nomads, the netizens, the humanitarians of the world). Tadiar is after something else, and it's not just waste per se that she wants to hone in on, but the act of wasting itself: ""Life as waste, on the other hand, is the modality in which the lives of disposable populations are dissolved into liquid life-times, which can be used by various kinds of capital as numerical units of capitalist temporality, measurable in terms of duration/endurance as well as of potentials/futures, to be expended as labor-times or sentencing times, calculated for investment and remittances, and packaged, priced and traded on derivative markets"" (217).Think of the predatory inclusion of the poor in financial instruments, designed to fail. Think of microfinance that in its ""solidarity lending"" collateralizes the very sociality that had emerged precisely to collectively protect from market relations. Think of how reproduction and feminized labors of care get caught in a double bind: ""On the one hand, social care is the only way to navigate plunder, but, on the other, care is the very thing being plundered.""6 Or take the floating and transnational migrant worker populations in domestic and service economies in China or the Middle East that political elites can render surplus at any moment—that are in fact surplussable or disposable already—and that function in effect, Tadiar tells us, as ""securitized assets"" (117). They are not new waged labor or even a reserve army of labor but a disposable ""life-time"" (not as opposed to labor-time) that is a kind of liquidity that can be effectively dumped—the way you dump dead stock—and as such are the very means by which governments and investors engage in speculative maneuvers in the global economy.Tadiar here refracts how we understand the nexus between war, dispossession, finance, and land. The land question has never gone away; it's there at the heart of neoliberal financialization. But if primitive accumulation still deracinates and displaces millions every year, they won't become simply the urbanized armies of labor, reserve or otherwise. Instead, they also become part of the quantitative indices, the ""inputs"" and ""assets"" of ruling elites and financial actors in the postcolonial and postsocialist global South. ""That is to say, in order for national developing states and economic elites to become viable players in the financialized global market, they must have at their disposal a population that can be made redundant to any particular lines of industry as dictated by the sudden vicissitudes of capital flows and that will ultimately shoulder the costs of fallout of any and all speculative maneuvers"" (117).This shift to a political economy of life (and death) as the core of valorization moves us past the stale oppositions between productive and unproductive labor. What had been epiphenomenal, not ""real"" categories of analysis, take center stage: ""What an older scholarship had seen as a site of unproductive, reproductive, hidden and supplemental work—a 'non-economic' relation that merely supplements the capital-labor relation comprising the central dynamic of accumulation—has become the primary site of value accumulation in the new financialized capital economy of life"" (6). This gives us a way of reading capitalism's contemporary colonial question a little differently. It's a shift that can reframe the tension that runs across settler-colonial studies between an alleged overemphasis on land and elimination, on the one hand, and a corrective attention to questions of labor exploitation, on the other. Instead we can think about how populations (as opposed to ""peoples"") can be subject to elimination, immunologically separated, and excluded from formal labor markets, and still be part of value generation. Surplus to labor and nation is not surplus to the operations of capital. And the logics of elimination and separation are not inimical to the logic of value.Take the colonization of Palestine. For all of Zionism's historic location in broader British imperialism and its contemporary location in global circuits of accumulation, the Zionist project was never an economically rational project. It required no returns on its investments, and its drive toward commodification and marketization has always been uneven, tempered by both demographic and territorial imperatives and by the necessity of distributing material spoils across its settler class structure (its colonial compensation of its settler working class). The Israeli state's logic via Palestinians is not only exclusionary, it is overwhelmingly eliminatory, ultimately genocidal, even if its drive remains stunted and to some degree checked. And yet, if we move past the seeming antinomy between exploitation and elimination, the threatening surplus that is Palestinian life is by no means beyond the operations of value. We can see this in the most primary source of value: land.The racialization of Palestinians as idle and itinerant is a value-generating legal-material practice because it is precisely what allowed and still allows for their removability from the land and that land's capture as state or private property. To become removable, they are first rendered disposable, rendered as entirely continuous with a mute nature that itself was of course always only ever a wasteland. And this operation is arguably the basis of all wealth, since it is precisely what allows for the commodification of labor and land. If value is always an abstraction, we know that in settler colonial orders this abstraction has historically functioned by bringing racial subjects and property together in a single taxonomy.7 We see it too, and in an even more literal instantiation of the value-waste dyad here, in the war-capital circuit. This same surplus and inassimilable population has today become the laboratorial target of an Israeli arms and security industry that sells its technology as ""field tested"" and that now constitutes a larger per capita share of the Israeli economy than ever before, and a larger share of the country's total exports than of any country on earth.8 In their very maimed, debilitated, and killed bodies Palestinians are part of speculative value generation on a global scale.9None of this should be seen as simply instrumental; racialization need not be economically rational to be a value-producing act. And yet the question remains of how to come to terms with all of this, with how disposability is formative of value, without imbuing an economic rationality to all of this. Or worse, reducing it all to certain laws of accumulation. In other words, while keeping open the reality of the gratuitous in all this.Dispossession endures. It never really gives way to the silent compulsions of economic power. It endures not as a historical stage, ""not as a disavowed systemic condition of formal capitalist exploitation, but as its core strategy and cutting edge"" (Tadiar, 34). We've learned this lesson by now. Or at least we should have. But its purchase is not always clear. For one, the lines of antagonism and struggle are often still muddled. We still regularly think of the class forces we're up against in the image of the maverick tech and finance overlords we get in the global North, driving productivity in techno-sublime innovation that pushes against the limits of state and capital itself. But the truth is, the robots aren't coming to get our jobs. Not because the tech lords wouldn't rather automate everything, but because those jobs are disappearing anyway, and because the creation of value from life and labor has less and less reliance on those jobs. What we're actually up against are not so much drivers of innovation as much as parasitic agents of capture. If they are still a bourgeoisie, they're closer to Gilles Deleuze's ""birds of prey"" that sweep into the fissures between feudalism and new forces of production than to Marx and Friedrich Engels's cold and venal but revolutionizing social force. These class forces don't reorganize productive relations as much as create choke points and obligatory passages, sites from which to capture activity and creativity that already exist—work, sociality, attention, time, life and vitality itself—and transform them into the promise of future revenue streams. This is in part one of the insights in the conceptual turn to ""neofeudalism"": the core of accumulation regimes today is not surplus value generated by waged workers producing commodities, but monopoly, rent, and coercion; and the global space of this capital is not the smooth flows of globalization but the fragmented, walled, and perforated zones or fiefdoms of layered partial jurisdictions and nested privileges.10Even here, though, Remaindered Life challenges the way we conventionally understand this relationship between capital and its ""outsides."" In the book it's not a precapitalist or noncapitalist world that is being captured, but a pericapitalist world that has already been shaped or primed through violence and ruination. Contra Rosa Luxemburg, then, who makes a strong turn in the first half of the book, there is no eventual self-defeating incorporation of the pericapitalist worlds into a universalizing process. If this is an outside, it's an outside that doesn't disappear, because new outsides are created all the time. This is in part what marks the ""new imperialism"" for Tadiar: it is a force that recolonizes its own unruly detritus—the territories, peoples, life forces, regimes that have already been spat out through deindustrialization, stalled development projects in the global South, or permanent counterinsurgency. In other words, imperialism today seeks ""to re-absorb the very ruin and ruination of past accumulation into present process of valorization"" (30). The competition is not for ""precapitalist spoils"" but for ""capitalist leavings."" War is but the most prominent political expression of this waste-to-value circuit. This is perhaps nowhere clearer today than in an Arab world that is arguably integrated into the global economy primarily through war and its adjacent extractive economies. Musing on what he calls ""accumulation by waste"" realized through imperialist war, Ali Kadri reminds us that ""waste and militarism are principal elements in an accumulation regime that produces value by consuming not only the value of labor-power, but also the value inherent in human lives.""11Seen as such, there doesn't seem to be an internal limit to capital at all—both the condition and the limit is remaindered life itself. If we see this world from the standpoint of remaindered life, ""from the standpoint of the milieu itself,"" as Tadiar urges us, then we ""see not the foretold disappearance of these noncapitalist lifeworlds . . . but their dynamic survival"" (38). This is one of the binds of this world of capture. This is an order that is deeply rapacious, brutal, pernicious, and indifferent. ""But it is also an order that, in requiring the survival and life activity of those human and nonhuman strata it would consume and destroy, has come to depend on what it despises, on forms of life that remain and become what lies just beyond its control, what must and cannot be fully incorporated in it and therefore always defines its limits and the fraying edges of its command"" (330).This is where the question of politics in the book seems to both appear and recede. This dynamic survival of the pericapitalist milieu also seems to be the opening for a kind of flight; it's the opening for uncaptured, or not fully captured, modes of living, or for practices of living that exceed the distinctions between a life worth living and a life worth expending. It's a world, Tadiar tells us, ""of ignominious survival, but also a world of living with gratuitous splendor"" (72), both a strife and a striving. There's a kindred resonance here with what AbdouMaliq Simone calls a ""surplus life-making"" in The Surrounds. For both Tadiar and Simone, these life forms of the dispossessed are in excess of both valorization and use and are a kind of disposition that is also its own gesture or figure of thought: for Tadiar a regard, for Simone a refrain.In both these books there's an insistence on moving past the presuppositions of political thought, past its staid dichotomies (resistance vs. survival, politics vs. life), and past its privileged localizations (the city, the square, the state). For Simone, it's the surrounds, the urban hinterlands within and beyond capture, that need thinking through; it's here we find forms of life that do not center on or concern the possibilities of inhabitation, but instead produce an eventfulness that constantly changes what it means to reside. These are lives in and of constant motion, the effects of impulsive but determined decisions to upend valued ways of living for more provisional circulations (8). And in part as a result, these lives hover at the edge of recognizability, maybe even at the edge of meaning. For in their nonabsorbability into productive life they are always close to ""failing to fulfill the protocols of subjectivity and sociality under the political order of democratic life"" (Tadiar, 103). Or put otherwise, they always ""simultaneously succumb to and resist the gravitational pulls registered by dominant imaginaries of the good life, the effective or transcendent life"" (Simone, 101).The question to me here is how we can, or indeed if we should, understand this as a politics, without falling for the temptation to read it as a claim-making sort of resistance, or even as an organizational potential just waiting to be mobilized, a premovement of a kind. What kind of political opening is there in a valorization process dependent on what it despises and cannot control? In the work of people like Vinay Gidawni, for example, the other side of the informalization of everything is the space it creates for autonomy or disarticulation: the growth of informal economies has made the disarticulation from the sway of value ""both more necessary and more possible.""12 The informalized—or better, the remaindered—have to inhabit all these different modalities of work and reproduction; they practice and inhabit so many multiple modalities of living, working, and getting by, and they are so dislocated from central sites of surveillance and discipline, that the work of value becomes uneven. This opens up a kind of relative autonomy, not to be naively celebrated or perfunctorily dismissed.With Tadiar and Simone the language of autonomy or freedom is markedly absent, even rebuffed. Tadiar begins by rhetorically cautioning against it: ""What might it mean to live when such living drives the global economy, to fight for freedom when freedom is a franchise"" (20). And by the end, she's unequivocal about resistance: ""This is not resistance by any existing political measure. Nor is it a potential to be tapped, mobilized, and organized"" (330). For Simone, what the dispossessed really have is accompaniment, the mutual possession of each other without guarantees, in enduring relationships in flight. If this is rebellion, it's rebellion without redemption, without end. Remaindered life, then, doesn't necessarily point to anything beyond itself, beyond its own happening, beyond its own gratuitous splendor. And for good reason. To read resistance into it is to put it back into a kind of social or political legibility for the rest of us; it is again to demote reproductive labors and life-making to a secondary concern; and it is to find consolation where there might not be any.And yet the question still remains: how do we understand remaindered life in relation to a present that seems synonymous with the condition of uprising? That is, in relation to our temporality of uprising, to a time that seems to be uprising itself, defined above all by a pervasive refusal and confrontation that moves past spectacular event and classical political movement increasingly into the capillaries of everyday life. A time in which the distance between the ""open socialities of survival"" and uprising, between life-making and revolt, shrinks. I mean here to point to the frequency and intensity of demonstrations, riots, strike waves, hunger strikes, occupations, and exits that over the last decade have been generalized. And generalized, we could say, precisely at the point of an understanding of the value-waste dyad and its dehumanizing degradations, which is in part why they've been thought of as existential uprisings, why there is so much emphasis on the body, and why the concept of dignity has marked them from the start. Both Tadiar and Simone are of course in one sense trying to move past precisely overarching schemas like uprising, and yet the worlds they so powerfully mediate seem today that much closer to the forms of generalized refusal I can only think of as uprising. As much as we live in an age of manmade planetary catastrophe, we also live in an age of renewed and constantly renewing planetary-level uprising. Uprising that is far from the previous organizing frames of revolution, but much more than episodic rebellion. Its social compositions are necessarily muddled, its demands often unclear or deferred, its prospects shaky, but it is self-explicitly a refusal, an accumulation of struggles with immensely disruptive power that exceeds, in its horizons at least, the sociality of survival. Where is remaindered life in this becoming ungovernable of the world?",2024-05-01,

Factors Affecting The Profitability of Plantation Commodity Business at PT XYZ,"PT XYZ was a company engaged as a marketing agent for plantation commodities. The company added new business lines, expanding from marketing agents to traders and retailers. However, the addition of business lines did not increase the company's profitability. A research was conducted to analyze the factors that impacted the profitability of PT XYZ. The research used financial performance analysis and statistical analysis of working capital management on profitability, and it examined the interaction with the covid-19 pandemic using multiple linear regression. The variables used in the statistical analysis were days sales outstanding (DSO), days inventory outstanding (DIO), days payable outstanding (DPO), and cash conversion cycle (CCC). The control variables included current ratio (CR), debt to equity ratio (DER), investment policy (IP), financing policy (FP), and company size (size). Additionally, there was a moderating variable, the covid-19 pandemic (dummy). The dependent variable in the study was the gross operating profit (GOP). The results showed that the working capital management of PT XYZ from the aspect of liquidity had a net working capital that posed low risk and low return. Based on the company's financial statements, PT XYZ had a relatively high cost of sales. Regarding the leverage aspect, the company's debt-to-equity ratio increased, indicating that its capital or equity could not cover its debt. The variable day's inventory outstanding (DIO) had a negative and significant effect on the profitability of PT XYZ companies on the independent variable gross operating profit (GOP).

TAX ASPECTS OF WITHDRAWAL FROM CIRCULATION AND DESTRUCTION OF MEDICINES BY PHARMACIES,"Strict regulation of the quality of medicines, as well as the establishment of expiration dates for them, are risk factors for commodity and financial losses of pharmacies associated with the withdrawal from circulation and destruction of medicines that are unusable for further sale. As taxpayers of taxes in force in the Russian Federation, pharmacies must take these transactions into account when they determine their tax obligations. Understanding the tax aspects of the withdrawal from circulation and destruction of medicines allows, at the stage of organizing these procedures, to minimize tax risks, and, consequently, the financial losses of pharmacies associated with their implementation in the form of additional charges of taxes, fines and penalties. The purpose of the study was to identify possible tax risks arising when medicines are withdrawn from circulation and to identify possible ways to reduce them. To achieve this goal, an analysis of legislative requirements, explanations of authorized bodies and current judicial practice on the issue under consideration was carried out. The analysis showed that operations for the withdrawal from circulation and destruction of medicines are a source of tax risks for pharmacies in terms of income tax and VAT. It was revealed that tax risks for income tax are associated, first of all, with incorrect documentation of the withdrawal of medicines from circulation. They are also possible due to the refusal to identify those responsible for the damage or their absence, the failure to file claims against the guilty parties and their lack of compensation for losses, and write-off before the expiration date. Tax risks for VAT arise if a pharmacy does not have evidence of disposal of medicines for reasons beyond the will of the owner and without transfer to other persons. To help reduce tax risks will be the inclusion in the internal regulations on the withdrawal of medicines from circulation and their destruction of provisions that take into account the norms of tax legislation and arbitration practice, as well as monitoring their compliance.",2024-04-30,
Examining Cryptocurrency Dynamics with Asian Equity Indices and Commodities: A Wavelet Coherence Analysis,"A wide range of interest has been shown in this field by investors and decision-makers due to the correlation between cryptocurrencies, Asian stock indexes, and commodities in the global financial market through partitioning the data and applying the wavelet analysis approach to analyze the described movement of various variables.

The findings are that; 1) The benefits of financial literacy to build a high sense of trust and behave with strong self-control in managing one's finances; 2) The benefits of financial literacy to create a sense of self-confidence and strong self-controlled behavior and its impact on the use of financial technology both directly and indirectly. Most of them are familiar with banking access. They already have a strong sense of self-confidence and self-controlled behavior regarding understanding banking products and services, so they feel interested in understanding banking technology products and services. The impact of this research is expected to provide wiser alternative financial decisions.",2024-04-30,
Financial modeling for global energy market impacts of geopolitical events and economic regulations,"The global energy market is highly susceptible to the impacts of geopolitical events and economic regulations, which often result in significant volatility and uncertainty. This study develops a comprehensive financial modeling framework to assess the impacts of these factors on energy prices, market dynamics, and investment decisions. Using advanced econometric techniques, such as Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), the research examines historical data to quantify the effects of geopolitical shocks, trade disputes, and regulatory changes on major energy commodities, including crude oil, natural gas, and renewable energy resources. Key findings highlight the critical role of geopolitical stability in influencing energy market performance, with events such as regional conflicts, sanctions, and trade embargoes causing sharp price fluctuations and market disruptions. Similarly, the introduction of stringent economic regulations, such as carbon pricing and renewable energy mandates, has a dual impact—driving up compliance costs while accelerating investment in sustainable energy technologies. The study underscores significant regional disparities in the magnitude of these impacts, with energy-exporting nations more vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions, while energy-importing economies face higher exposure to regulatory-driven cost increases. Through scenario analysis, the research evaluates potential future market outcomes under various geopolitical and regulatory scenarios, providing actionable insights for policymakers and market participants. Results suggest that diversification of energy sources and investment in renewable technologies are critical strategies to enhance market resilience and mitigate the risks associated with geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties. This study contributes to the growing literature on energy economics by offering a robust financial modeling approach to evaluate complex market dynamics. By integrating geopolitical and regulatory factors into energy market analysis, it provides a valuable tool for stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop adaptive strategies in a rapidly evolving global energy landscape.",2024-04-30,
Sell It Forward: The Form and Reason of Today’s Conventional Money,"How is today's conventional money created? And how is it governed? Imaginaries of money as either commodity or debt–credit relation attempt to elucidate the ontological nature of money – a long-standing debate that tells little of how money actually works. A more pragmatic approach to money starts with the mechanics of money. It looks at what bankers – commercial and central – actually do. It approaches money from balance sheets, looking at how money is created, marked up and down, and destroyed as notations in ledgers. Following the mechanics of today's money quickly elicits that we have a hybrid monetary system in which money is introduced into the economy as interest-bearing debt to sell forward to financial actors. The particular implementation of this accounting process results in continuously rising economic inequality and our ecological predicaments. The mechanics of today's conventional money do not align the interests of those creating it to the interests of people or planet. Understanding the direct relation between today's money mechanics and our sustainability challenges sets the stage for many efforts to reimagine, reclaim and reorganise money.",2024-04-29,
Evaluating Supply Chain Performance through Financial Metrics: A Study in a Manufacturing Industry,"This empirical study is based on primary data emphasizing the importance of evaluating supply chain performance through financial metrics, each activity within the supply chain directly impacts both the top line and bottom line of a business. In today's challenging business environment, organizations must prioritize monitoring their financial performance to ensure enduring resilience. The economy of Bangladesh has encountered turbulence due to disruptions such as the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing global political unrest. These occurrences have significantly impacted the business landscape, resulting in uncertainties in both demand and supply, shifts in consumer purchasing patterns, and notable increases in the prices of essential commodities and raw materials, therefore, the overall cost of business has risen. This study investigates the consequences of various disruptions, both internal and external, on the economy, adversely affecting organizations. The ability of an organization to withstand such challenges depends on maintaining robust financial and operational performance. Given the persistent global upheaval, there is a compelling need for an innovative approach to enhance supply chain optimizations, overall operational efficiency, and meticulous budget control and variance analysis aligned with financial planning. This is crucial at a substantial level to ensure positive entries in the profit and loss account and maintain a healthy cash flow statement. This study is done based on twenty-four (24) manufacturing sectors of Bangladesh. To address these challenges, the study advocates an Integrated Supply Chain Performance Measurement (ISCPM) model. This model contributes to academia through a novel approach, demonstrating its effectiveness by employing ten attributes to evaluate supply chain performance, with a specific focus on the financial performance termed Financial Health (FH), an attribute to measure supply chain performance in an organization. The study further elaborates Financial Health attributes into five key Performance Measurement Index (PMI) which are Economic Performance, Cost, Budget Variance, Inventory, and Planning Variance —within the context of manufacturing operations, providing insights into various facets of their impact. The study significantly contributes to the industry for practitioners by bringing synergy into the framework and performance measurement attributes, ultimately adding value to the manufacturing industry.",2024-04-29,
"Improving Technology and Production Management in the Palm Sugar Craftsman Group in Rambah Tengah Hulu Village, Rokan Hulu Regency","Palm trees are one of the potential commodities to be developed in Indonesia, one of which is in Rambah Tengah Hulu Village, Rambah District, Rokan Hulu Regency. Usually, craftsmen process palm water into molded palm sugar. The survey results show that 16 palm sugar craftsmen in Rambah Tengah Hulu Village have joined the palm sugar craftsmen group. It's just that this group has not been active for a long time. The main problems found among palm sugar craftsmen are that the production process of processing palm sap into palm sugar still uses very simple technology, the size of the product produced is not yet uniform, and palm sugar craftsmen have never received training or counseling regarding management, planning and recording business finances, so it is necessary Efforts are made so that groups of palm sugar craftsmen can maximize their business development. The aim of implementing this service is to provide solutions in improving technology and management of palm sugar business production. The method for implementing this service is that first the craftsmen are given counseling about the importance of forming a group in a business, then the craftsmen are given counseling about financial planning and recording. Craftsmen also make furnaces and tools for molding palm sugar and are given assistance in using and maintaining them. The result of this community service activity is that the average understanding of partners about the importance of group formation, planning and recording finances has reached 77.95%. Craftsmen understand the use of applied technology and craftsmen understand planning and recording business finances, as can be seen from the increased understanding of participants before and after carrying out activities. Craftsmen also have uniform printing equipment and modified furnaces.Technology; production management; Palm sugar",2024-04-29,
The Influence of Education on Women and Food Security,"The study analysed the influence of education on women and food security in South Africa. The methodological approach was a qualitative analysis using focus group discussions and an in-depth desktop review of relevant literature on the education system. The focus group discussions were about rural women's farming initiatives, looking at the influence of education on productivity. According to the study, educational level and farm productivity are directly correlated. The women in the focus group discussions mentioned that education and training were critical for food production and household food security. In addition, education is essential for women to imagine and implement strategies and opportunities to gain employment and move up the commodity value chain. Furthermore, a specialised curriculum in technical subjects at primary and secondary levels targeting girls was essential for establishing a strong foundation for them. Adult education, especially in primary education courses targeting women, improves women's agriculture participation. Since women are the custodians of smallholder agriculture, gender transformative approaches such as tailor-made financial and leadership support are also critical for the socio-economic development of agriculture in South Africa.",2024-04-28,
"Determinants of Smallholder Farmers' Awareness of Crop Insurance in Kedah, Malaysia","Agriculture is a major source of income for humans and has become an agro-food commodity. However, this industry is vulnerable to a wide range of dangers, including climate change, natural disasters, illnesses, and pests. Crop insurance is not a new concept in advanced economies since it has been recognized as an efficient instrument for mitigating agricultural risks and encouraging farmers to employ modern technology and innovation. This research investigates the determinants of smallholder farmers' awareness of crop insurance in the agricultural landscape of Kedah, Malaysia. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between knowledge, risk attitude and farm size on the farmers' awareness of crop insurance. The study, based on a sample of 100 farmers, utilizes a non-probability sampling technique to collect data through structured questionnaires. The research employs reliability analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis to evaluate the raw data and uncover the factors influencing farmers' awareness of crop insurance. The study conclusion shows a strong correlation between farmers' knowledge levels and farm size as important indicators of crop insurance awareness. The analysis emphasizes how crucial it is to increase farmers' understanding through focused educational programs and customized awareness campaigns that take farm size dynamics into account. Policymakers and agricultural extension services can enable smallholder farmers to make well-informed decisions about using crop insurance as a strategy to manage agricultural risks and guarantee financial stability by making information and resources easily accessible.",2024-04-27,
Рrospects for expanding the export of agricultural food products of the Republic of Belarus to the markets of Asian countries,"In the context of economic challenges and sanctions restrictions, multi-vector foreign trade and development of new segments of the world market remain a priority task of the state foreign economic policy of the Republic of Belarus. Asian countries, characterized by a large population, growing demand for these products against the background of an insufficient level of self-sufficiency, diverse taste preferences of consumers, as well as an increase in their purchasing power, are considered as one of the directions for the geographic expansion of exports of agri-food products. Under conditions of the unstable general economic and agrarian situation on the continent, Vietnam, Iran, China, and Singapore are our country’s key trading partners among Asian countries. This requires a comprehensive study to determine the further interaction of these countries with the Republic of Belarus. Scientific results are presented, including the justification of customs-and-tariff and non-tariff conditions for access to the markets of Vietnam, Iran, China, and Singapore, as well as a developed set of effective ways for promoting Belarusian agri-food products on the territory of these states. In addition, a forecast of export supplies of domestic products was carried out, taking into account the specifics of trade policy and trade and economic cooperation between the Republic of Belarus as a member state of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Asian countries under study. Practical implementation of the results obtained will allow Belarusian exporters to create competitive advantages based on the application of preferential terms of trade, increasing the efficiency of financial and non-financial instruments, expanding organizations’ access to support mechanisms, development of agricultural commodity distribution network, introduction of information, communication and digital tools for sales and marketing policies.",2024-04-27,
"Tail-spillover effects between African currencies, bitcoin, gold and oil during two recent black swan events","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, African currencies, cryptocurrencies, and commodity markets have undergone significant fluctuations, displaying fat-tail properties that lies at the outer ends of the normal probability curve. The recent Russia-Ukraine war has further disrupted these markets, generating considerable interest among academics and practitioners. Our study delves into tail-end returns and volatility connectedness between Bitcoin, crude oil, gold, and four African currencies amidst the COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war. Employing a quantile vector autoregressive (QVAR) approach, we analyze tail-end spillover effects between markets from 4 November 2019, to 7 September 2022. Our findings reveal heightened connectedness at the quantile ends of co-movements, with left-tail spillovers being more pronounced for returns, while right-tail spillovers dominate for volatility. Bitcoin, and to a lesser extent gold and oil, emerge as effective tail-ended hedges for the Egyptian Pound and Nigerian Naira but not for other African currencies like the Algerian Dinar and South African Rand. Consequently, users of Egyptian and Nigerian currencies in international financial markets can seek hedging opportunities in traditional cryptocurrencies and commodities during recent Black Swan events, unlike those using South African and Algerian currencies. Additionally, our results suggest limited diversification benefits associated with (i) currencies linked to oil-exporting or oil-importing countries, (ii) currencies linked to Shariah-compliant financial systems, but do indicate diversification benefits in high-inflation environments. These findings hold relevance for investors seeking improved hedging strategies against African currency risk and for African policymakers aiming to enhance intra-continental trade, foreign direct investment, and cross-border business expansions.",2024-04-26,

Part A. General outlines of, and comments on, the three volumes of Marx's Capital Karl Marx: his work and the major changes in its interpretation (2003, 22 pages). From Companion to the history of economic thought, edited by Warren Samuels, Jeff Biddle and John Davis, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 148–66. Abstract: Marx's magnum opus, Capital, is an analysis of the capitalist system. The changing appreciation of this work throughout the twentieth century has been influenced by both the degree to which other works of Marx were, or could be, taken into account (§2) and, relatedly, developing methodological views; five methodological aspects are briefly reviewed – historical materialism, critique, naturalistic versus socio-historical concepts, value-form theory, systematic dialectics (§3). The article provides a synopsis of the general structure of Marx's Capital, outlining for each volume of Capital what 'capital' is, how it works and its resulting process (§4). Marx's conceptualisation of value in Capital (2019, 26 pages). From The Oxford handbook of Karl Marx, edited by Matthew Vidal, Tony Smith, Tomás Rotta and Paul Prew, New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 129–50. Abstract: This chapter reviews the three conceptual stages of the determinants of the commodities' value in Marx's Capital. It concludes that the dynamic second stage (designed in 1866–67) overrules the third stage – of prices of production (designed 1864–65). The first stage (Capital I, Part One) is an important though static averages account, positing that the commodities' value is determined by average socially necessary labour-time. The second stage (Capital I, Part Four) is a dynamic account of the 'intensity of labour' and the mainly technology-determined 'productive power of labour', each one implying, first, that clock-time of labour is an insufficient measure and, second, that rates of surplus-value diverge between sectors of production. Whereas intensity-determined inter-sector rates of surplus-value might equalise due to intra-labour competition, Marx posits no mechanism for such equalisation regarding the technology-determined productive power. The third stage posits the transformation of values into prices of production (Capital III, Part Two – its text being based on a manuscript from 1864–65). The article's main finding is that the determinant of the 'technology-associated productive power' was a novel result of Marx's 1866–67 final version of Capital I (1867). It makes Marx's earlier third stage redundant. Dialectical method (1998, 6 pages). From The handbook of economic methodology, edited by John B. Davis, D. Wade Hands and Uskali Mäki, Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, pp. 103–7. Abstract: After a brief outline of the distinction between historical dialectics and systematic-dialectics, the entry focuses on the latter. It does so by bringing out main elements of this method in so far as they relate to some of the problems that face the mainstream philosophy of economics. Marx's method (1998, 7 pages). From The handbook of economic methodology, edited by John B. Davis, D. Wade Hands and Uskali Mäki, Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, pp. 283–7. Abstract: This article distinguishes Marx's method for the study of sequences of social formations (or modes of production), that is, his 'historical materialist' method, from his method of studying the systematic interconnections of a single social formation such as the capitalist one. All commentators agree that in Capital Marx applies a particular systematic method for outlining these interconnections, by way of moving in stages from abstract to concrete categories. There is, however, disagreement on the status of each of the stages, as well as on the mode of progression from one stage to the other. Accordingly, Marx's method in Capital is termed differently. For a long time the method has been looked upon as a logical-historical approach (an interpretation propagated by Engels), or as a method of successive approximation where one starts with simplifying assumptions that are gradually dropped (propagated by Sweezy 1942). Other interpretations have focused on the particular dialectic adopted by Marx. The second part of the article expands on the latter. The interconnection of Systematic Dialectics and Historical Materialism (2000, 28 pages). From Historical Materialism, 7, pp. 137–65. Abstract: Within the Marxian paradigm – and far more so than in other paradigms – the work of its founder, Marx, has been a continuous inspiration for new theoretical developments. This is fine. However, in much twentieth-century Marxian theory, this has gone along with an inclination to present new theoretical developments as new interpretations of (especially) Marx's Capital instead of as reconstructions. This article illustrates this for two main building blocks of the paradigm, namely its method and its theory of value, focusing for the former on 'historical materialism' and 'systematic dialectics' and for the latter on the concepts of 'social form' and 'abstract labour'. More specifically, this illustration is articulated in an engagement with work of Patrick Murray on these issues. One main conclusion is that, as with all founders of new paradigms, Marx is bound to express his break with the old ideas to a large extent in the traditional language – in his case that of Hegel and of classical political economy – which inevitably opens up enormous problems of interpretation. Rather than focusing on (perhaps dubious) re-interpretations, clarity would be served if Marxian scholars were to present their new theoretical findings as reconstructions. Part B.

"Dynamic spillover between crude oil, gold, and Chinese stock market sectors –analysis of spillovers during financial crisis data during the last two decades","The present study investigates the presence of asymmetric return spillovers among crude oil futures, gold futures, and ten Chinese stock sector markets. Time-varying asymmetric spillovers between commodities and the 10 sectors are shown by utilizing the spillover index developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014). Our findings indicate that the industrial and discretionary consumer sectors generate and benefit the most from spillovers. Furthermore, it has been established that the basic materials sector exhibits a net positive impact on spillovers. In contrast, oil futures, gold futures, and other sectors demonstrate a net negative impact as recipients of spillovers. Moreover, the negative return spillovers outweigh the positive return spillovers. Our analysis spans from 2000 to 2023 to include various financial crises. The spillover effects of asymmetry are impacted by various factors, including the global financial crisis (GFC), the European sovereign debt crisis (ESDC), the decline in oil prices, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Including gold and oil in individual equity markets can benefit equity investors. Furthermore, implementing hedging strategies is susceptible to the global financial crisis, economic slowdown, oil price decline, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The oil futures exhibit the greatest hedging effectiveness during the COVID-19 spread. The findings indicate that gold exhibits comparable outcomes solely in the presence of positive spillover effects. At the same time, its performance reaches its peak during the recovery phase in the context of negative spillover effects.",2024-04-25,
"Digital finance, financial regulation and transformation of R&amp;D achievements","The transformation of scientific and technological achievements is the best form of the combination of technology and the economy, and only when new technologies are transformed into commodities can they be transformed into real productive forces and exert scale effects. With the rapid development of digital finance, it has changed the operating mode of financial markets and consumer behavior. Does digital finance promote the transformation of R&D achievements? We empirically examine this question using the panel data covering 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2021. The empirical results indicate that the development of digital finance can improve the transformation rate of R&D achievements. Additionally, we find that the role of digital finance in promoting the transformation of R&D achievements needs to be guaranteed by the level of effective financial regulation. The research conclusions are a relevant reference for the government to improve the transformation rate of scientific and technological achievements.",2024-04-25,

HODL It Forward: The Form and Reason of Algorithmic Money,"Today's discussion on money is as much driven by a frustration towards the financial system as it is by excitement about new technological developments. Among others, much hope is placed on blockchain technology and the cryptocurrencies that use it, for, these monetary entrepreneurs argue, it makes money truly apolitical. The chapter unfolds Bitcoin to unveil a monetary design that translates 'monetary stability' into monetary rigidity, rendering this money incapable of adapting to the needs of the economy and inciting currency owners to hold it forward, to speculate on its future value. In aggregate, the consequences of such individual behaviour are far from apolitical, just as the governance of the underlying algorithm by a small closed community of tech-experts is. Imagined, designed and governed as a commodity, this form of money has no built-in mechanism to foster its circulation through the real economy and work for the 'small casual transactions' Nakamoto intended bitcoin to support. This is unfortunate for, being the first cryptocurrency, it frames the imagination of many of the efforts in this monetary entrepreneurial space.",2024-04-25,
Financial Analysis of The Anchovies Purse Seiner Vesel Bisuness Based in Larangan Coastal Fishing Port Tegal Regency,"The Larangan Coastal Fishing Port (Larangan CFP) is the only fishing port in the administrative area of Tegal Regency, as a quite productive fish landing center and is the catch of fishermen operating in the coastal watiers of Tegal with anchovy main commodity. Because it is one of the fishing tools of the fishing community which is classified as productive and is based in the Larangan CFP. is the type of anchovies surrounding net (purse seine) In this study, 8 units of purse seiners were selected using light capture device (lamp) as samples, using case study and observation/interview metods and financial analysis which include; Profit and Loss, Payback Period, B/C Ratio, BEP, NPV, IRR and Swiching Value. From the calculation results of the economic (financial) analysis of fishing activities with purse seine anchovies based at the Larangan CFP, Tegal Regency is general can be categorized as feasible, because all business feasibility indicators are still above the required criteria as a feasible business activity to run. The avarage value of each of these indicators is; Paybac Period (4.4 years or 4 years 3 months), Break Even Point (Rp.202,168,749), B/C Ratio (1.24), NPV (Rp.325,474,008), and IRR (22%). Then the replacement value (Switching Value) also still sows a business that is feasible continuimg with an average B/C Ratio of 1.20 and a Payback Period of 5.2 years with the analysis of two scenarios of each situation; 3% for a decrease in production value, and 3.5% for an increase in input prices.",2024-04-25,
Analysis of the Impact of ESG Performance on Financial Market Stability from the Perspective of Multivariate Statistical Models,"The stability of the financial markets is impacted by environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, which also lowers the risks associated with social injustice, climate change and poor corporate governance. Companies that prioritize ESG standards have a higher probability of being resilient to market shocks, attracting responsible investors and contributing to long-term sustainable economic growth. By the utilization of multivariate statistical models, we seek to execute thorough analysis in this study to assess the effect of ESG performance on financial market stability. The sample that was selected comprises various categories of companies. Financial in sequence from the stock market is retrieved; include balance sheets, cash flow statement and income statements. An ESG rating is also acquired for the inquiry. The collected data were evaluated using a multivariate regression analytical representation. Our empirical methodology ensures robustness in identifying the complicated relationships between ESG performance and financial market stability, providing expensive insight into the dynamics of Chinese A-share organizations. The result express that increasing the ESG rating reduces financing limitations such as financial insecurity, increases future risk resistance and improve the company’s standing for obtaining a commodities premium. The association determines that an advanced ESG rating leads to enhanced financial market stability, which in turn contributes to the stock market concert. This underscores the essential roles of ESG consideration in attractive market resilience and financial market stability.",2024-04-25,
BERT vs GPT for financial engineering,"The paper benchmarks several Transformer models [4], to show how these models can judge sentiment from a news event. This signal can then be used for downstream modelling and signal identification for commodity trading. We find that fine-tuned BERT models outperform fine-tuned or vanilla GPT models on this task. Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and natural language generation. Among the most prominent transformer models are Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which differ in their architectures and objectives. A CopBERT model training data and process overview is provided. The CopBERT model outperforms similar domain specific BERT trained models such as FinBERT. The below confusion matrices show the performance on CopBERT & CopGPT respectively. We see a ~10 percent increase in f1_score when compare CopBERT vs GPT4 and 16 percent increase vs CopGPT. Whilst GPT4 is dominant It highlights the importance of considering alternatives to GPT models for financial engineering tasks, given risks of hallucinations, and challenges with interpretability. We unsurprisingly see the larger LLMs outperform the BERT models, with predictive power. In summary BERT is partially the new XGboost, what it lacks in predictive power it provides with higher levels of interpretability. Concluding that BERT models might not be the next XGboost [2], but represent an interesting alternative for financial engineering tasks, that require a blend of interpretability and accuracy.",2024-04-24,
Initial public offering of shares as a tool for attracting financial resources by the company,"The study aimed to determine the fundamentals of entering the stock market and the process of initial placement of shares of Ukrainian companies on such exchanges. The entry of companies to the capital market is a stage of expansion of production capacities, improvement of the company's management system, the opening of new markets, the possibility of increasing investments in innovative activities, etc. The transition of national economies to an open global economy has led to the need for additional investment attraction not only within the country of the base of such a company but also on international capital markets. The most common option for obtaining additional financial capital is the initial issue (IPO) and the sale of company shares. The company is being transformed into a public or private joint-stock company. Ukrainian legislation has formed the relevant legal field within which the process of issuing and placing company shares takes place - the Law of Ukraine ""On Securities and the Stock Market,"" ""On Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets,"" etc.; The decision of the State Securities and Stock Market Commission - ""Procedure for transferring bearer shares issued by the issuer in documentary form into registered shares. ""Regarding the foreign practice of regulating the IPO process, we note that each country has its requirements, but in most cases, they are similar in content. The process of placement of securities on the open market is accompanied by sufficiently large risks, which become the critical factor that forces Ukrainian companies to refuse placement on international stock markets. The IPO process includes the following stages: preliminary, preparatory, primary, and post-placement. Underwriting allows you to minimize IPO risks. An investment bank that helps a company list on the stock exchange assumes certain obligations regarding this placement and guarantees the issuer its redemption for further sale among investors.

Floriculture and Transgenic,"“Genetic engineering has revolutionized floriculture by enabling the modification of plant species and the creation of new flower color varieties (Chandler, Stephen et al, 2010). Despite the global cultivation of transgenic crops, floriculture has been slow to adopt transgenic breeding. ""Floriculture, with its cut flower market as a significant component, is on track to achieve a market size of $43.8 billion by 2027, according to Markets and Markets. This industry plays a crucial role in uplifting rural economies through international trade. For instance, floriculture products from Africa find their way to markets in the U.S. and Europe. Similarly, Asian nations such as Japan, China, and India are strengthening their financial positions through the import and export of floriculture commodities (Tanaka, Yoshizu et al., 2009). One of the notable advancements in floriculture has been the creation of new flower color varieties by manipulating pigment metabolic pathways in plants. However, there are challenges. Some flowering plants, despite their high market value, do not realize their full economic potential due to issues like prolonged flowering seasons and diseases."" These challenges can be addressed through the production of transgenic plants using genetic engineering and plant tissue culture techniques. The study aims to explore the potential of genetic engineering associated with plant tissue culture techniques in enhancing floriculture, particularly in developing new flower color varieties and improving the production of high-value flowering plants, thereby highlighting the economic impact of floriculture globally.",2024-04-24,
"The Influence of the Banking Sector on Economic Growth and Commodity Prices: A Panel Data Analysis of Spain, France, and Romania","This study aims to investigate the impact of the banking sector on economic growth and commodity prices. Through panel data analysis, the research explores the relationship between the banking sector and economic growth in Spain, France, and Romania from 2000 to 2020. The findings reveal a positive correlation between the strength of the banking sector and economic growth across these nations, underscoring its pivotal role in fostering economic expansion and subsequently improving commodity prices. Additionally, this study evaluates various regulatory measures crucial ensuring the banking sector’s sustainability and preventing financial crises, including credit risk management, lending policies, liquidity constraints, and international financing and investment strategies. By analyzing the interplay between regulatory measures and banking sector performance, incorporating variables such as non-performing loans, household debt, liquid liabilities, government consumption expenditure, foreign investments, and trade openness, this research provides policymakers with valuable insights to formulate effective strategies for promoting economic stability and ensuring the sustainability and growth of the banking sector.",2024-04-24,
Framing the housing crisis: politicization and depoliticization of the Dutch housing debate,"How does a housing crisis become a crisis? In answering this question, this paper turns to framing in public and political debate. The case is the Netherlands where in the decade following the Global Financial Crisis the debate on housing quickly developed. Drawing on a discursive analysis of parliamentary documents, newspaper items, and interviews, the paper reveals how a housing crisis frame became central in debate, through a sequence of incubation, development and escalation. These debates shown signs of politicization as they increasingly emphasize the structural causes and political roots of the current situation, while also framing housing as primarily a fundamental right rather than a market commodity. This politicization, however, is matched by depoliticizing tendencies as relatively much attention is directed to the housing issues of the middle classes and young adults. Findings help us understand how housing struggles are understood, and which policies are deemed acceptable and necessary.",2024-04-23,
"Capitalist, Evolution, Financial Innovations and Financial Literacy: A Study of their Dynamics in Shaping Modern Capitalism","Finance has had its root in human history since human being started a settled civilized life. As production for trade took a shape, various means of transactions and storage of value kept on evolving. Gradually, finance took the center stage with the evolution of modern capitalism. In early stages the financial instruments remained a scattered individual means of financial practice, no central regulation existed in the early era. Hence the acquaintance with these instruments was also confined to individual users, the traders, particularly. Since economic productivity was quite low, ordinary individuals had little surplus to save, not many had much to do with financial literacy. The modern capitalism required industrial workers, surplus of agricultural products, more consumers for market, more means of production to produce trade surplus and more financial savings and instruments to channelize investments. Also the producers were required to be alienated from the product of labour so that the trade of commodities could be taken in control by the trading class. Also the means of production, which was otherwise the ownership of the households, was to be turned marketable to facilitate the transfer the ownership from ordinary owners to the trading class. The trinity of commodity production, wage labour and market system altogether had to evolve for capitalism to come into existence. Accordingly, various financial instruments took shape, the traditional ones became more formalized and many new ones were invented. The evolution of different forms of business, the 'company' form particularly, helped this process in a big way. Simultaneously, the financial anarchy put the systems in turmoil and hence regulatory bodies became a compulsion. These regulatory bodies assumed the twin role of regulation of financial markets, financial facilitation, as well as creating financial literacy among ordinary people to link their savings to the mainstream trade and commerce lines. The paper attempts to portray the evolution of modern financial system and find out how this evolution has been linked to the financial literacy of the common masses. Also the paper would throw lights on imminent market and systemic hazards caused by excess leliance on financialisation of economic system.",2024-04-23,
The Multi-Social Relation of the Cattle Industry in the Plaosan Subdistrict Animal Market of Magetan Regency,"As a legacy of the colonial era, the people of East Java have established cattle raising and development with four fundamental objectives in mind. To begin with, the cow signifies social standing. Social status in the local community is established not only by the financial resources of individual families, but also by the number of cows housed in a given pasture. Furthermore, the bovine serves as a support animal during the process of mating. The bovine is a sacred animal in East Java, representing matrimony to the local populace. Third, cows as economically beneficial animals. Furthermore, cattle are a commodity in which local economic authorities with vast business networks engage in commerce. Regarding cattle businessmen, this descriptive qualitative study seeks to investigate the socioeconomic networks of lower-class cattle producers who also practise subsistence agriculture. As qualitative research, this study collected field data through three primary methodologies. Initially, a comprehensive interview was undertaken with purchasers, the Magetan regency administration, and the local strong man business network. The second is the observation that was conducted in Plaosan subdistrict animal market and Dele villages in Magetan regency. Furthermore, an extensive focus group discussion (FGD) was conducted with stakeholders from the selling cycle, including local governments, businesses, cattle merchants, and the general community. This study's findings will be disseminated via scientific journals and local media.",2024-04-23,

Estimation and Prediction of Commodity Returns Using Long Memory Volatility Models,"Modelling the volatility of commodity prices and creating more reliable models for estimating and forecasting commodity price returns are crucial. The body of research on statistical models that can fully reflect the empirical characteristics of commodity price returns is lacking. The main aim of this research was to develop a modelling framework that could be used to accurately estimate and forecast commodity price returns by combining long memory models with heavy-tailed distributions. This study employed dual hybrid long-memory generalised autoregressive conditionally heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models with heavy-tailed innovations, namely, the Student-t distribution (StD), skewed-Student-t distribution (SStD), and the generalised error distribution (GED). Based on the smallest forecasting metrics values for mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) values, the best performing LM-GARCH-type model for lithium is the ARFIMA (1, o, 1)-FIAPARCH (1, ξ, 1) with normal innovations. For tobacco, the best model is ARFIMA (1, o, 1)-FIGARCH (1, ξ, 1) with SStD innovations. The robust performing model for gold is the ARFIMA (1, o, 1)-FIGARCH (1, ξ, 1)-GED model. The best performing forecasting model for crude oil and cotton returns are the FIAPARCH 1,ξ, 1−SStD model and HYGARCH 1,ξ, 1−StD model, respectively. The results obtained from this study would be beneficial to those concerned with financial market modelling techniques, such as derivative pricing, risk management, asset allocation, and valuation.",2024-04-23,
The Right to Work in International and National Law in the Time of Globalization,"Work is not a commodity like all other commodities, but it is an emanation of the human person. For this reason, its value is higher than all other things. With the beginning of industrialization, in addition to state measures for the protection and education of work, the workers joining forces in mutual unions have done everything to oppose the inferiority of the labor factor to capital. It should be emphasized that the right to work is not a subjective right that you can claim in court in case of non-realization, but it is a principle that the State through policies must be committed to create conditions for everyone to be employed. In the time of economic and financial globalization that today's society is experiencing, the right to work is not regulated only in national legislation, but also in international legislation and collective contracts. In this work, the sources of international labor law approved by the ILO, the UN and some regional organizations such as the Council of Europe and the European Union will be explained first. It is very important to know the international sources for labor law because they occupy a privileged position in the hierarchy of sources of law in the Republic of Albania, which are often overlooked by law enforcement officers. After exhausting the sources of international labor law, the national sources will be treated with a focus on our Constitution. A special place in this work will be occupied by trade union freedom and the right to strike according to domestic law, which have historically represented the basic means to protect the rights of women workers. At the end of the report in this conference, we will briefly dwell on the impact of globalization on labor law.

Risk transference between climate variability and financial derivatives: Implications for global food security,"We investigate the impacts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on global food security by using information embedded in financial derivatives. Using a state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM) climate forecasting system that generates observations on the phase and magnitude of ENSO, we create novel indices that track its uncertainty throughout time. Together with the option implied volatilities of core food inputs (wheat, maize, rice, and soybean), we model the time-varying volatility spillover from ENSO to each commodity, capturing the direction and intensity of risk transference. Simulating Gaussian and non-Gaussian impulse responses that mimic an increase in climate variability show a persistent impact on the price uncertainty of the commodities lasting up to three months. We also show that shocks are contingent on the phase of ENSO, with warmer conditions in the Eastern Pacific (i.e., the El Niño phase) increasing risk transference for soybean and rice. In contrast, the La Niña phase has a material influence on the uncertainty of wheat and maize. In all, we reveal a volatility transmission channel of climate variability that affects financial markets, suggesting valuable inferences about the impact of climate shocks can be derived from the rich information embedded in commodity-linked derivatives.",2024-04-21,
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION: AS PANACEA FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA,"For many years, the Nigerian economy has been precariously reliant on crude oil, a single, volatile commodity, for its sustenance. As a result, its growth trajectory has been uneven and influenced by fluctuations in oil prices. It is concerning that Nigeria has neglected the development of its non-oil sector over the years and has become increasingly dependent on the oil industry to raise money. This paper examines the impact of the non-oil sector on the long-term growth and development of the Nigerian economy using a time series dataset from 1980 to 2016 obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin and using the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation technique in a linear regression model. The findings indicate that Nigeria's non-oil sector's contribution to the country's sustainable growth is subpar. Policymakers cannot ignore the need to carefully develop the non-oil sector to diversify the Nigerian economy, given the cyclical nature of global oil prices and economic growth, to achieve sustainable growth and development, it is necessary to move past over-reliance on the oil sector and implement diversification strategies, such as developing the non-oil sector. This paper discusses this need. For Nigeria to successfully achieve diversification, the government must implement laws and business initiatives to boost private sector investment, concentrate on the industrialization of the non-oil sector, and support innovations and improvements in public financial management systems and processes through fiscal transparency and accountability.&#x0D; Keywords: Diversification, Growth, Panacea, Economy, Development.",2024-04-20,
"Understanding the mediating role of perceived risk in the relationship between price, product quality, and copra repurchase intention in North Maluku province","This study aims to examine the relationship between perceived risk, price, and product quality as it pertains to the intention to repurchase copra in North Maluku Province. Coconut meat, commonly known as copra, is the raw material for making crude coconut oil. Apart from being a superior commodity and contributing greatly to the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) of North Maluku Province from the agricultural sector, this product has experienced a decline in purchases since 2022 until now. We used a quantitative method based on SEM analysis, with a sample size of 120 respondents. The primary data collection technique used was a questionnaire. While this study did find a significant relationship between product quality and perceived risk and between perceived risk and repurchase intention, it did not find a significant relationship between price and repurchase intention or product quality and repurchase intention directly. Concurrently, there is full mediation in the indirect influence of product quality on repurchase intention; that is, perceived risk is a key component of the relationship between product quality and repurchase intention. If buyers feel that there is a low risk associated with product quality, they will be more likely to consider repeat purchases. Perceived risk can include financial, operational, and reputational risks associated with poor-quality products.",2024-04-19,
Global patterns of commodity-driven deforestation and associated carbon emissions,"Achieving global climate and biodiversity targets and ensuring future food security will require halting agriculture-driven deforestation. Accurate data on the commodities driving deforestation across time and space is crucial for informing policy development, implementation and evaluation. However, such information is currently hampered by limited and heterogeneous data availability (in both comprehensiveness and scope), computational challenges, and lack of updates to the existing databases, that diminish their accuracy and relevance over time. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Deforestation Driver and Carbon Emission (DeDuCE) model, a framework that merges remotely sensed datasets with comprehensive agricultural statistics to enhance the quantification of agriculture and forestry-driven deforestation globally. Developed using Google Earth Engine and Python, DeDuCE is designed to integrate new and emerging datasets, ensuring the model remains efficient and relevant despite increasing data volumes. This approach also ensures adherence to FAIR data principles, emphasising replicability, adaptability and utility. DeDuCE reports over 9,100 unique country-commodity deforestation footprints across 176 countries and 184 commodities from 2001-2022, surpassing existing databases in scope and detail. The insights from DeDuCE are crucial for governments, companies, and financial institutions aiming to undertake deforestation and emissions accounting, risk assessments, and sustainability evaluations of investments.",2024-04-18,
US technological statecraft towards China,"Purpose This study aims to define a “technological statecraft” concept to distinguish tech-based measures/sanctions from an array of economic measures ranging from restrictions of rare earth elements and natural gas supplies to asset freezes under the wider portfolio of economic statecraft. This concept is practically intended to reveal the USA’s “logic of choice” in its employment of technology as an efficient instrument to deal with China in the context of the great power rivalry. Design/methodology/approach This study follows David A. Baldwin’s statecraft definition and conceptualization methodology, which relies on “means” rather than “ends.” In addition to Baldwin and as an incremental contribution to his economic statecraft analysis, this study also combines national political economy with statecraft analysis with a particular focus on the utilization of technological measures against China during the Trump administration. Findings The US rationale for choosing technology, namely, emerging and foundational technologies, in its rivalry against China is caused at least by two factors: the nature of the external challenge and the characteristics of the US innovation model based largely on radical innovations. To deal with China, the USA practically distinguished the role of advanced technology and followed a grammer of technological statecraft as depicted in the promulgated legal texts during the Trump administration. Originality/value Despite a growing volume of literature on economic statecraft and technological competition, studies focusing on countries’ “logic of choice” with regard to why and under what conditions they choose financial, technological or commodity-based sanctions/measures/controls are lacking. Inspired from Baldwin’s account on the “logic of choice” from among alternative statecrafts (i.e. diplomacy, military, economic statecraft, and propaganda). This study will contribute to the literature with a clear lens to demonstrate the “logic of choice” from among a variety of economic statecraft measures in the case of the US technological statecraft toward China.",2024-04-18,
Ranking mineral exploration targets in support of commercial decision making: A key component for inclusion in an exploration information system,"An exploration information system (EIS) is a way of creating, and managing exploration targets and should include the entire process from conceptual mineral system models to, modelling the mineral system using available data, to generation of targets or prospect areas. The main goal for any EIS is to help find new mineral deposits that are economic to mine and process at the financial conditions of the time. Prioritisation and management of exploration targets is a key to success in mineral exploration, particularly with the increasing use of mineral potential modelling techniques, including AI, which can generate a large number of targets in a study area for testing. In this paper, we present ideas for the components for an EIS designed to optimize the mineral exploration process and provide critical decision-making support. The Macquarie Arc porphyry copper-gold mineral system in New South Wales is used as an example to illustrate how such a system can be developed and implemented. Accepted mineral potential mapping workflows are used coupled with a targeting process that generates, attributes, and ranks prospect areas to produce exploration targets. The proposed front-end of the EIS is an Exploration Management Dashboard, which can be used by executives and managers to facilitate informed decision-making and optimal allocation of capital. We advocate for a standardised system capable of accommodating various commodities, input datasets, and diverse analytical techniques, including AI-driven methods and validation tools. Flexibility for user customisation, especially for non-technical users, and real-time data integration are seen as an essential part of any EIS. Furthermore, the system is designed to be dynamic, with continuous updates and improvements as new data are collected, ensuring that exploration is always focussed on the areas with the greatest potential prospectivity.",2024-04-17,
Optimising Portfolio Risk by Involving Crypto Assets in a Volatile Macroeconomic Environment,"Portfolio diversification is an accepted principle of risk management. When constructing an efficient portfolio, there are a number of asset classes to choose from. Financial innovation is expanding the range of instruments. In addition to traditional commodities and securities, other instruments have been added. These include cryptocurrencies. In our study, we seek to answer the question of what proportion of cryptocurrencies should be included alongside traditional instruments to optimise portfolio risk. We use VaR risk measures to optimise the process. Diversification opportunities are evaluated under normal return distributions, thick-tailed distributions, and asymmetric distributions. To answer our research questions, we have created a quantitative model in which we analysed the VaR of different portfolios, including crypto-diversified assets, using Monte Carlo simulations. The study database includes exchange rate data for two consecutive years. When selecting the periods under examination, it was important to compare favourable and less favourable periods from a macroeconomic point of view so that the study results can be interpreted as a stress test in addition to observing the diversification effect. The first period under examination is from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021, and the second from 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022. Our research results ultimately confirm that including cryptoassets can reduce the risk of an investment portfolio. The two time periods examined in the simulation produced very different results. An analysis of the second period suggests that Bitcoin’s diversification ability has become significant in the unfolding market situation due to the Russian-Ukrainian war.",2024-04-17,
Integração de Séries Temporais Financeiras e Informação Textual na Previsão do Mercado de Commodities Agrícola,"The agricultural commodities market is known for its volatility and complexity, where factors such as weather conditions, global demand, government policies, and geopolitical events significantly influence experts' decisions and prices in the markets.In recent years, there has been a growing interest in machine learning applications in agribusiness, aiming to minimize the challenges posed by the chaotic and complex landscape of the financial market.These applications explore technological advances to improve price and trend forecasting, providing strategic insights to domain experts.Recently, studies have been developed using natural language processing techniques and time series data in various fusion strategies, generating alternative multimodal representations for prediction models.Integrating data from multiple sources aims to provide forecasts considering factors not explicitly present in time series data.However, proposing multimodal models and representations is challenging due to the temporal alignment between text data and time series.Additionally, the availability of labeled documents for the agribusiness domain is scarce, making the direct application of multimodal models difficult.Given this scenario, this thesis aims to develop and evaluate time series representations integrated with semantic text representations, exploring innovative approaches to enhance time series predictions enriched with texts and automatic news classifications with patterns extracted from time series.The proposed approaches consider strategies that can be applied in real market scenarios.The results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can be an alternative to improve forecast accuracy in complex and volatile markets, offering an innovative perspective on integrating textual data and time series in the context of agribusiness.",2024-04-17,
KEY ASPECTS OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CHARACTER OF COMPETITION ON THE UKRAINIAN FOOD MARKET,"The set of opportunities of an agricultural enterprise to create competitive advantages make up the potential of its competitiveness. However, competitive advantages, especially those that can be characterized as sustainable, are formed on the basis of the mobilization of the economic potential of the enterprise, which is a set of opportunities for the long-term implementation of the main activity of the business entity. Accordingly, the study identified the place and role of the potential of competitiveness in the structure of the enterprise's potential and its relationship with the economic potential. In turn, it was established that the components of economic potential are production potential in combination with commercial and sales opportunities, the basis of all types of enterprise potential is resource potential, and the potential of product competitiveness and enterprise competitiveness is based on the economic potential of the enterprise, contributing to the growth of the latter. Agricultural producers face many problems that can prevent them from growing and selling their products profitably. The problem of ensuring the effective economic activity of the studied subjects of agricultural production lies in the relative complexity of the relationships between them within the framework of the current market environment. the market environment of the functioning of commercial structures is not homogeneous, and the levers of state regulation do not have an unequivocal effect on all operators of one or another commodity market at the same time. To increase productivity and expand participation in market relations, they absolutely need appropriate mechanisms and policy measures. In the current situation, it becomes necessary for each manufacturer to analyze its competitiveness and develop effective means to increase it. An important condition for ensuring the competitiveness of enterprises is the effective use of resources, personnel qualifications, achievements of modern management, innovative, financial and informational capabilities of the enterprise, which together represent its potential. State determination of the legal field of existence of market participants requires a clear understanding of the relevant state of their interaction and the development trends of this interaction. The consequences of agricultural regulation policy and the manifestation of market forces in relation to the productivity and evolution of the food industry vary depending on the field, direction of production, etc.",2024-04-17,
"IMPACT OF CASHLESS POLICY ENFORCEMENT AND NAIRA REDESIGN ON FRESH CATFISH MARKETING IN MAKURDI LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF BENUE STATE, NIGERIA","The study examined the impact of Cashless Policy Enforcement and Naira Redesign on Fresh Catfish Production and Marketing in Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State, Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling procedure was employed to select 100 respondents for the study. Data were collected with the aid of structured questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics and farm budgeting techniques. The result revealed that fresh catfish producers were in their productive age with mean age of 34years. Majority (76%) of the fresh catfish producers were males and 84% married. The average household size and farming experience were 5 persons and 6 years, respectively. The results of the profitability analysis of catfish marketing in the study area before and during the cashless policy enforcement and Naira redesign revealed that before the policy, the catfish producers’ total variable costs and total fixed costs were N1701379 and N665689.22, respectively, making a total cost of N2367068.22. The results further revealed that total revenue of N2659284.66 and a net farm income of N292216.440 were realised. The profitability ratio shows that for every one naira invested, the catfish producers made about 89 kobo. However, the result revealed that, amid the cashless policy enforcement and Naira redesign, the total variable cost and total fixed cost were N827791.66 and N712688.47, respectively, making a total cost of N1540475.13. The results revealed total revenue of N1650800 and a net farm income of N110384.87. The profitability ratio shows that for every one naira invested, the catfish producers made about 92 kobo. The result of the impact of catfish marketing on the income level of the marketers in the study area before and during the cashless policy enforcement and Naira redesign revealed that before the policy, 30%t of the catfish marketers had an income of over N300, 000. However, during the policy, only 26% of the catfish farmer marketers had an income of over N300, 000 and 15% had an income of less than N50, 000. The result of the constraints to catfish marketing before and during the cashless policy enforcement and Naira redesign revealed that before the policy, the most constraints to catfish marketing were high electric charges (12.3%) and lack of credit facilities (9.1%). However, during the policy, the most constraints to catfish marketing were inadequate capital (8.3%), seasonality of commodity (7.8%), high cost of feed (7.4%), high cost of production (7.3%), high cost of labour (7.3%) and low demand of product (7.0%). The study concluded that Catfish production and marketing in the study area was more profitable before the cashless policy enforcement and Naira redesign. The study recommended that provisions for agricultural incentives such as short and long-term loans, with a single digit interest rate for the marketers in order to solve the problem of lack of credit facility. Also, Marketers should form marketing cooperatives to increase their access to credit from financial institutions and hence alleviate the problem of inadequate capital.",2024-04-16,
Advance Sequential Models for Asset Trading: Leveraging LSTM &amp; RNN with Stochastic RSI and MACD Indicators,"Abstract: The goal of stock market prediction is to forecast a company's financial stocks' future worth. The application of machine learning, which creates predictions based on the values of the current stock market indices by training on their prior values, is a recent trend in stock market prediction technologies. Machine learning utilises many models to facilitate accurate and reliable prediction. The study focuses on stock value prediction using regression and LSTM-based machine learning. Considered factors are volume, low, high, open, and closed. We also employ algorithmic trading, which is a technique for automatically executing orders based on pre-programmed trading instructions that take volume, price, and time into account. This kind of trading aims to take advantage of a computer's speed and computational power in comparison to human traders. Algorithmic trading has become more popular in the twenty-first century, prompting traders to respond. According to a 2019 research, 92% of traders use algorithms rather than people. The moving average convergence &amp; divergence and the relative strength index are our primary tools. One technical tool employed in financial market analysis is the relative strength index, or RSI. Charting a stock's historical and present strength or weakness with retail and institutional traders is the goal. Investment banks, mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds all utilise it extensively when they need to perform trades. based on the closing prices of a recent trading period, too fast for a human or the market. It is important to distinguish the indicator from relative strength. The RSI measures the speed and size of price changes and is categorised as a momentum oscillator. The rate at which prices rise or fall is known as momentum. The ratio of higher closes to lower closes, where closures are defined as averages of absolute values of price changes, is the relative strength, or RS. The RSI determines momentum by dividing higher closes by overall closes, or stocks with more or stronger positive moves. The RSI is most commonly employed during a 14-day period and is scaled from 0 to 100, with 70 and 30 representing the high and low readings, respectively. Alternately shorter or longer outlooks are associated with shorter or longer time frames. Although they happen less frequently, high and low levels— 80 and 20, or 90 and 10—indicate increased momentum. J. Welles Wilder created the relative strength index, which was first published in the June 1978 issue of commodities magazine and in his 1978 book New concepts in technical trading systems, and in commodities magazine in the June 1978 issue.",2024-04-15,
Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Optimization and Risk Control of Trading Strategies,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based optimization leverages advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex decision-making problems in various domains. Deep learning in trading involves the application of sophisticated neural network architectures to analyze financial data and make predictions in stock markets, forex, commodities, and other trading domains. Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), traders can extract valuable insights from vast amounts of historical market data, including price movements, trading volumes, and market sentiment. These models can learn complex patterns and relationships within the data, enabling them to forecast future market trends, identify potential trading opportunities, and manage risks more effectively. Deep learning in trading has shown promise in improving decision-making processes, enhancing trading strategies, and achieving higher returns, although challenges such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and overfitting remain areas of ongoing research and development. In this paper evaluated the stock market to achieve the financial gain to achieve the significant improvement in prediction with the stock trading. The data related to the stock market are optimized with stock trend data of 7,000 stocks situated in the United States. The estimated stock trade data were computed and processed with the Multiagent Q-learning model for the data detection and classification. A deep Q-network is developed to adaptively pick distinct action subsets and train the market making agent based on the inventory states. The experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our suggested methodology in feature learning and superiority in accuracy improvement when compared to deep learning-based modelling of frequency trading patterns and standard signal processing approaches for stock trend prediction.",2024-04-13,
Viral Threats to Fruit and Vegetable Crops in the Caribbean,"Viruses pose major global challenges to crop production as infections reduce the yield and quality of harvested products, hinder germplasm exchange, increase financial inputs, and threaten food security. Small island or archipelago habitat conditions such as those in the Caribbean are particularly susceptible as the region is characterized by high rainfall and uniform, warm temperatures throughout the year. Moreover, Caribbean islands are continuously exposed to disease risks because of their location at the intersection of transcontinental trade between North and South America and their role as central hubs for regional and global agricultural commodity trade. This review provides a summary of virus disease epidemics that originated in the Caribbean and those that were introduced and spread throughout the islands. Epidemic-associated factors that impact disease development are also discussed. Understanding virus disease epidemiology, adoption of new diagnostic technologies, implementation of biosafety protocols, and widespread acceptance of biotechnology solutions to counter the effects of cultivar susceptibility remain important challenges to the region. Effective integrated disease management requires a comprehensive approach that should include upgraded phytosanitary measures and continuous surveillance with rapid and appropriate responses.",2024-04-13,
"Dynamic volatility among fossil energy, clean energy and major assets: evidence from the novel DCC-GARCH","Abstract The objective of this paper is to assess the dynamic volatility connectedness between fossil energy, clean energy, and major assets i.e., Bonds, Bitcoin, Dollar index, Gold, and Standard and Poor's 500 from September 17, 2014 to October 11, 2022. The main motivation of the study relates to examining the dynamic volatility connectedness mentioned during periods of important events such as the recent coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict which has shown the vulnerability of economic and financial assets, energy commodities, and clean energy. The novel Dynamic Conditional Correlation-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) approach is employed for the investigation of the sample period mentioned. Empirical analysis reveals that both the total and net volatility connectedness between assets is time-varying. The highest connectedness among the assets is observed with the onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and it increases with some important international events, such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict, the referendum of Brexit, China–US trade war, and Brexit day. On average, the result shows that 32.8% of the volatility in one asset spills over to all other assets. The DCC-GARCH results also indicate that crude oil, bonds, and Bitcoin act as almost pure volatility transmitters, whereas the Dollar index, gold, and S&amp;P500 act as volatility receivers. On the other hand, clean energy is found neutral to external shocks until the first quarter of 2020 and after that time, it starts to behave as a volatility transmitter. Based on the obtained results, we offer some specific policy implications that are beneficial to the US economy and other countries.

Saving farm subsidies with smart climate interventions: the case of transition to a millet-based agriculture,"Purpose The study attempts to estimate farm subsidies the governments can save by transitioning to a millet-based production system, replacing GHG emission-intensive crops. Design/methodology/approach It updates a 131 × 131 commodity input–output (IO) table of the year 2015–16 into 2021–22 using the RAS procedure and simulates the economy-wide impacts of replacing rice and wheat with pearl millet and sorghum using consumption and production approaches. It then quantifies fertilizer, electricity and credit subsidy expenses the government can save through this intervention. It also estimates the potential reduction in GHG emissions that the transition could bring about. India is taken as a case. Findings Results show pearl millet expansion brings greater benefits to the government. It is estimated that when households return to their pearl millet consumption rates that prevailed in the early-reform period, this could save the Indian government Rs. 622 crores (USD 75 m). The savings shall be reinvested in agriculture to finance climate adaptation/mitigation efforts, contributing to a sustainable food system. Net GHG emissions also decline by 3.3–3.6 MMT CO2e. Practical implications Indian government has been actively aiming to bring down paddy areas since 2013–14 through the Crop Diversification Program and promoting millets (and pulses and oilseeds) on these farms. The prime reason is to check rapidly declining groundwater irrigation in Green Revolution states. Regulations in the past in these states have not brought the intended results. Meanwhile, electricity and fertilizers are heavily subsidized for agriculture. A slight shift in the cropping system can help conserve these resources. Meanwhile, GHG emissions could also be brought down and subsidies could well be saved. The results of the study indicate the same. Social implications A less warm society is what governments and nongovernment organizations across the world are aiming for at present. Financial implications affect actions against climate change to a greater extent, apart from technological innovations. The effects of policy strategies discussed in the study, taking a large country as a case, when implemented appropriately around the regions, could help move a step closer to action against climate change. Originality/value The paper addresses a key but rarely explored research issue – that how a climate-sensitive crop choice will help reduce the government’s fiscal burden to finance climate adaption/mitigation. It also offers a mechanism to estimate the benefits within an economy-wide framework.",2024-04-12,
"Private sector participation in infrastructure in emerging market and developing economies: Evolution, constraints, and policies","Abstract The private sector can play important roles in closing the infrastructure investment gaps in emerging market and developing economies. However, private participation in emerging market and developing economies' infrastructure has declined over the past decade, reflecting persistent structural challenges and risks in the business environment. The decline was broad‐based and gained momentum following the 2013 taper tantrum and the end of the commodity super cycle. Incentivizing greater private sector participation in infrastructure will require policies to improve access to long‐term finance and to derisk the business environment. This will require efforts to strengthen the banking sector regulation and supervision, to improve the legal and contractual environment, and to limit information asymmetries. Deepening local financial and bond markets can make it possible for infrastructure bonds to be issued in local currencies and minimize potential currency mismatches. Improvements in the broader business environment can benefit from greater macroeconomic stability and stronger institutional frameworks. Policies that improve the quality of projects at entry, address currency risk, relax capital controls, and enable cost recovery pricing can unlock private sector participation in infrastructure financing. Strong government support, including ensuring regulatory quality, and providing well‐targeted guarantees and subsidies, can play a critical role.",2024-04-11,
Quantifying the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Housing Prices in Los Angeles using Time Series Analysis,"The real estate market is an indispensable part of both the national economy and the financial system. For households, housing is one of the most important consumer commodities, and a family’s finances and expenses are bound to be significantly influenced. For a country, the housing market majorly affects the growth of the GDP, so even a small fluctuation in the real estate market can lead to a subsequent impact on the economy as a whole. Therefore, it is worthwhile to take housing price forecasts into consideration. In addition, with the outbreak of COVID-19, the impact this pandemic brings to the real estate market needs to be analyzed. As a result, this research focuses on making a forecast of housing prices in Los Angeles by applying the ARIMA model and then quantifying how the COVID-19 affects housing values using time series analysis. In that case, policymakers can make more informed regulations on the real estate market, making citizens' lives easier than before.",2024-04-10,
Volatility Transmission Role of Indian Equity and Commodity Markets,"The rate at which a security's price swings, i.e., increases or decreases for a specific set of returns, is how volatility is expressed. When one financial market's volatility disruption has a significant negative effect on another financial market's volatility (i.e., conditional variance), this is known as volatility spillover. In the modern day where financial markets are highly interconnected, it is essential to comprehend such transmission to capitalize on the benefits of portfolio diversification. The present paper investigates the volatility transmission role of two major Indian financial markets, mainly the commodity and equity futures markets. Specifically, we examine the unconditional volatility spillover among equity future index and commodity composite (Comdex) as well as sectoral (energy, metal, and agricultural) future indices. We have applied two stationarity tests along with the Diebold-Yilmaz (DY) volatility spillover model on daily realized volatility series of selected indices. Since the volatility series of sampled indices are not directly available, it is calculated for each index using the range method. Therefore, the official websites of MCX and NSE have been used to extract information regarding the high and low daily futures prices of equity and commodity indices respectively, for the period from 2007 to 2022. Initially, the descriptive analysis revealed that the energy index has the highest average volatility as well as unconditional volatility followed by equity, metal, comdex, and agri indices, respectively. Furthermore, all the sampled series are asymmetrically distributed as these are positively skewed and leptokurtic. Both stationarity tests confirmed that none of the volatility series have a unit root. Therefore, we proceed further by applying a DY volatility spillover model with lag order 5, forecast horizon of 10 and 200 days of rolling window to examine connectedness among indices through static analysis. The study found that, on average, 29.20% of the forecast error variances have been explained by the spillover effect. Furthermore, Comdex acts as the highest net volatility transmitter followed by Equity. In contrast, the energy index acts as the highest net volatility receiver followed by the metal index and the agri index. Nonagricultural indices are more sensitive to other indices volatility than agricultural indices. All these insights into the volatility transmission role of the stock as well as commodity markets will certainly assist practitioners, individual as well as institutional investors along with policymakers.",2024-04-09,
"COVID-19 or Russia-Ukraine Conflict, Which Is Informative in Defining the Dynamic Relationship Between Bitcoin and Major Energy Commodities?","This chapter examines an essential methodology to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine conflict surprises and conception statements employed for the dynamic conditional correlation between returns and volatilities of energy commodity indices and Bitcoin. To assess analytically the unexpected component of COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine conflict surprises, the authors use GARCH-DCC(1,1) model by incorporating a dummy variable which measures the surprise factor during the period of study from January 4, 2016, to April 4, 2022. The results suggest significant and considerable dynamic conditional correlation between energy commodities indices and Bitcoin if COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict shocks are incorporated in variance assessments. Additionally, these outcomes demonstrate the financialization phenomena of energy commodities indices and Bitcoin. The authors find that the dynamic conditional correlation between energy commodities indices and Bitcoin start to respond considerably more in the situation of Russia-Ukraine conflict shocks than COVID-19 surprises.",2024-04-09,
Analysing the Factors Behind Exchange Rate Fluctuations in India,"Abstract: The study gives an overview of the various determinants of the exchange rate movements in India. Out of the multiple factors affecting the Rupee-Dollar value the impact of Interest rate differential, Trade deficit of India, Foreign Net investment inflows to India, Oil prices, and Gold prices (in the short term) on the exchange rate has been studied using Regression analysis and correlation and the role they played by the above mentioned variables in determining the exchange rate during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2010 and during the Covid-19 Period from 2020-2023. Exchange rate fluctuations play a crucial role in shaping the economy of a country, and India is no exception. The exchange rate of the Indian rupee against major world currencies is subject to constant fluctuations, influenced by a multitude of domestic and global factors. These fluctuations have significant implications for various stakeholders, including businesses, consumers, investors, and policymakers. Several factors contribute to the exchange rate fluctuations in India. One of the primary factors is the demand and supply dynamics of foreign exchange. Factors such as trade balance, foreign direct investments, portfolio investments, remittances impact the demand for and supply of foreign currency, Crude oil prices, Gold prices, and thereby affecting the exchange rate. In addition, macroeconomic variables like inflation, interest rates, and economic growth also play a crucial role in determining exchange rate movements. For instance, a high inflation rate in India compared to trading partner countries can lead to a depreciation of the rupee. Global economic conditions and geopolitical events are other significant factors influencing exchange rate fluctuations in India. Economic developments in major trading partners, changes in global commodity prices, and geopolitical tensions can all impact investor sentiment and capital flows, leading to fluctuations in the exchange rate. For example, uncertainties related to Brexit or trade tensions between major economies can trigger volatility in currency markets. Monetary policy decisions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also play a crucial role in influencing exchange rates. Interest rate changes, open market operations, and forex interventions by the central bank can impact the value of the rupee visa-vis other currencies. The RBI often intervenes in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rupee or prevent extreme volatility. Apart from these factors, market speculation, investor sentiment, and technological advancements in the financial markets can also contribute to exchange rate fluctuations. High-frequency trading, algorithmic trading, and the use of complex financial instruments by market participants can amplify exchange rate movements and increase volatility",2024-04-09,
Testing event-based day of the week anomaly and trading opportunities: Evidence from Indian sectoral indices,"The study is an attempt to examine the day-of-the-week anomaly of fourteen Indian sectoral indices and identify profitable opportunities, considering multiple positive and negative events. The aim of this study is to analyze the day-of-the-week effect on fourteen Indian sectoral indices and find profitable opportunities while considering multiple events that have positive and negative impacts. The study takes into consideration event-based anomalies, both national and global, and provides timing for trading to generate abnormal returns from the market. At first, dummy variable regression analysis was used to understand the initial anomalies. Later, time-varying symmetrical and asymmetrical volatility models, such as Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (1, 1) and Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (1, 1) were applied to determine the short-term and long-term volatility persistence. These models capture the leverage effect from various events that occurred during the study. The results showed mixed outcomes during multiple positive and negative shocks. After the recession, anomalies were observed across all sectoral indices, except for commodities, energy, and information technology. During the scam period, anomalies occurred in all sectors, except for consumer durables, financial services, and information technology. However, after the new government took over, anomalies persisted in all sectors. During the pandemic, anomalies persisted in all sectors except for finance, IT, pharmaceuticals, and services. Hence, national and global events have shown varied impacts on the Indian markets. The study provides investors with implications on strategies and timing techniques for planning their investments in different sectors of the Indian economy.",2024-04-08,
"Examining spillovers and connectedness among commodities, inflation, and uncertainty: A quantile-VAR framework","This paper explores dynamic interactions and connectedness between inflation, commodities, and economic and monetary policy uncertainty during various market phases between 1985 and 2022, developing upon the innovative quantile-VAR methodology. Results reveal that inflation exhibits strong interlinkages with money supply, as would be expected, along with the price of gold during periods of low-price levels, while presenting a strong positive relationship with both oil valuations and the money supply during periods representative of moderate or average pricing behaviour. Moreover, inflation is identified to be a receiver of direct influence and broad connectedness, especially during the Global Financial Crisis and during episodes of US-based quantitative easing programmes, while exhibiting even more pronounced effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Money supply is identified to be the most receptive to overall external influence from the selected variables. Furthermore, economic policy uncertainty is identified as the strongest source of influence, with effects surpassing that of monetary policy uncertainty. Market risk is identified to possess the strongest effects at the highest quantiles. This study provides insight into the interconnectedness of the real economy and financial markets across various economic conditions.",2024-04-07,
The Impact of Value Chain Financing on Profitability for South Africa's Edible Oil Manufacturing Companies: Raw Materials and Working Capital Approaches,"Edible oil manufacturing companies in South Africa generate significant amounts of revenue, which they do not capitalize on. South Africa has no shortage of consumer demand for commodities. The edible oil sector is hampered by poor raw material output in the nation, insufficient financing by value-chain participants, and a shortage of specific effort and understanding in growing the value chain. The research aim was to evaluate the impact of value chain financing on profitability for South Africa's edible oil manufacturing companies via raw materials and working capital approaches. Utilizing secondary data collected from the financial statements of edible oil manufacturing companies from 2012 to 2022. Throughout the research, a positivism paradigm was applied using a descriptive retrospective panel data approach. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the connection between the value chain financing variables (raw materials as well as working capital) and the profitability of edible oil manufacturing companies in South Africa. On financing in raw material there was a negative correlation among the two variables, but it is not statistically significant (r = -0.030, p =.424). On financing in working capital, there was a positive correlation (r =.201, p =.012), the connection between financing in creditors management and profitability in the edible oil company has a positive correlation (r =.162, p = 0.09) but is not statistically significant. The research found that raw material financing and working capital financing had no statistically significant connection to the profitability of edible oil manufacturing companies in South Africa.",2024-04-07,
The Impact of Farm Production Factors on The Income of Horticultural Farmers in East Java,"In agricultural growth, the horticulture subsector holds a crucial place. However, one of the most common and productive challenges that farmers deal with is capital limits. Lack of financing is frequently cited as a barrier to addressing rising production costs and erratic commodities selling prices. Financing for factors of production becomes challenging as a result. This study aims to analyze the influence of farm production factors on the income of horticultural farmers in East Java. Data collection was conducted in two locations, namely Wonomulyo Village, Poncokusumo District, Malang Regency, and Pacet Village, Pacet District, Mojokerto Regency. These two locations were chosen purposefully because they are horticulturally producing centers in East Java with the most financial institutions, with a total of 160 respondents. Data collection methods can include interviews using a questionnaire tool. To fulfill the research objective, multiple regression analysis has been used. The land area variable has the most influence since income and land area interact in such a way that as land area is utilized, revenue rises accordingly. The data indicates that there is a positive significance between land area and income in East Java's horticulture farms. Farmers need to seek to intensify horticulture to increase production on existing land with a farming venture. As well as the development of the agribusiness system through Cooperative Farming.",2024-04-05,
SABIC's Pathway to Carbon Neutrality and The Role of Hydrogen,"Introduction: SABIC's global petrochemical playSaudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) is the third largest petrochemical company in the world, headquartered in Riyadh and operating in 50 countries.SABIC was established in 1976 under a Royal Decree as a joint-stock company with 70% of its shares owned by the Saudi government and the remainder held by public investors (Sabic 2006).The primary reason for its establishment was to ramp up the Kingdom's petrochemical, fertilizer, and metal manufacturing capacity and to ensure that manufactured products meet domestic demand and enter the export market (Sabic 2006).In 2020, Saudi Aramco acquired the government's shareholding in SABIC through the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund.The acquisition aimed to leverage domestic synergies, as Aramco supplies SABIC with its natural gas feedstock.It also aimed to strengthen Saudi Aramco's competitiveness in international petrochemical markets by accessing SABIC's global research and marketing capabilities (Sabic 2020).Additionally, the acquisition helped SABIC, which can now take advantage of Aramco's financial heft to become more competitive globally.SABIC operates through three strategic business units (SBUs), namely, petrochemicals, agri-nutrients, and specialties, and one standalone organization, the Saudi Iron and Steel Company, known as Hadeed (Sabic 2020).• The petrochemicals SBU focuses on the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of commodity and performance chemicals as well as polymers (Sabic 2021).It accounts for the largest proportion of SABIC's production and sales volumes, namely 79% and 78% of the total in 2021, respectively (Sabic 2021).With almost 86% of total revenue, it is the main contributor to SABIC's bottom line.",2024-04-05,

How effective are the enforcement activities of derivatives exchanges in the digital age? A survey of enforcement notices through the lens of humans,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to scrutinise the effectiveness of four derivative exchanges’ enforcement efforts since 2007. These exchanges include the Commodity Exchange Inc. and ICE Futures US from the United States and ICE Futures Europe and the London Metal Exchange from the UK. Design/methodology/approach The paper examines 799 enforcement notices published by four exchanges through a behavioural science lens: HUMANS conceived by Hunt (2023) in Humanizing Rules: Bringing Behavioural Science to Ethics and Compliance . Findings The paper finds the effectiveness of the exchanges’ enforcement efforts to be a mixed picture as financial markets transition from the digital to artificial intelligence era. Humans remain a key cog in the wheel of market participants’ trading operations, albeit their roles have changed. Despite this, some elements of exchanges’ enforcement regimes have not kept pace with the move from floor to remote trading. However, in other respects, their efforts are or should be, effective, at least in behavioural terms. Research limitations/implications The paper’s findings are arguably limited to exchanges based in Anglophone jurisdictions. The information published by the exchanges is variable, making “like-for-like” comparisons difficult in some areas. Practical implications The paper makes several recommendations that, if adopted, could help exchanges to increase the potency of their enforcement programmes. Originality/value A key aim of the paper is to shift the lens through which the debate concerning the efficacy of exchange-level oversight is conducted. Hitherto, a legal lens has been used, whereas this paper uses a behavioural lens.",2024-04-03,
Study on the volatility spillover effect and nonlinear dynamic evolution mechanism of economic policy uncertainty and asset prices--an analysis of futures prices of oil and grease agricultural products based on the VAR-BEKK-GARCH-VS model,"<title>Abstract</title> In recent years, the uncertainty of the domestic and foreign economic environment on China's futures and financial markets is increasingly significant, this paper to economic policy uncertainty, securities markets, futures markets, producer costs of the role of the path, the construction of the VAR-BEKK-GARCH-VS model to explore the volatility spillover effect of economic policy uncertainty and asset prices, nonlinear dynamic evolution, empirical analysis results show that Oil and grease futures prices and financial markets have significant risk spillover effects and asymmetry, and usually oil and grease agricultural commodity futures prices are the risk transmitter of the volatility spillover; from the static spillover effect, oil and grease agricultural commodity futures price fluctuations have the strongest degree of influence on China's agricultural commodity market; in terms of the dynamic spillover effect, the oil and grease agricultural commodity futures prices under the impact of extreme events have significant time-varying characteristics and asymmetry, and the impact on China's futures prices is not significant, and the impact on China's futures prices is not significant. In terms of dynamic spillover effect, the futures price of oil and grease agricultural products under the impact of extreme events has significant time-varying characteristics and non-symmetry, and is more dependent on the fluctuation of China's futures price. Based on this, policy makers should adopt policy guidance and market subsidies to improve the reserve and insurance system of oil and grease agricultural products futures; economic and financial management authorities should establish a risk monitoring and early warning mechanism in China's oil and grease agricultural products futures market to effectively prevent systemic risks.",2024-04-03,
The Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Cryptocurrency Adoption in Investments: a Bibliometric Study,"In the post-COVID-19 era, academic papers on changing financial investment habits are proliferating rapidly as the pandemic has disrupted economic and financial markets, altered investment decisions, and brought new risks and challenges. In addition to traditional market instruments such as gold, oil, and other commodities, cryptocurrencies have attracted new attention due to their dynamic and decentralized nature in these extraordinary times, which must be constantly analyzed from different angles. This paper aims to analyze the evolving academic interest in the adoption of cryptocurrencies for investment decisions, focusing on research papers published in the Scopus database between 2020 and 2023 through bibliometric analysis. The Scopus database provides high-quality publications that have been peer-reviewed and rigorously scrutinized, and the chosen time period corresponds exactly to the period that was sufficient to provide a significant amount of research. The choice of bibliometric research methodology supported our research question and significantly improved our understanding of the relationship between the rise in financial market usage related to COVID-19. The specific focus of this research shows a significant correlation between COVID-19 and cryptocurrencies as an investment option, as evidenced by the increasing number of academic papers and collaboration between numerous countries and institutions. The analysis of the bibliometric research results underlines the increasing importance of cryptocurrencies as alternative investment opportunities in the financial markets. A remarkable interest in this area can be observed globally, with leading countries such as China, India, the USA, the UK, and Malaysia driving research efforts. Through the use of bibliometric analysis, this study encourages cross-border collaboration and highlights the academic recognition of cryptocurrencies as viable investment opportunities in the international financial landscape.

Does the “Belt and Road Initiative” benefit the environment? Insight from analysis of intra-industry trade in environment goods,"The expansion of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has raised a wide range of concerns about its environmental impact. Therefore, from the perspective of environmental impacts, this study used the two-way fixed effect staggered differences in differences (TWFE Staggered DID) method to examine the impact of the BRI on the Environment Goods (EGs) intra-industry trade (IIT) between China and other Belt and Road (B&amp;R) countries, including a sample of 191 countries, covering the period from 2010 to 2019 for eliminating the impact of COVID-19 and the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Because only 135 countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding between 2010 and 2019, this study treated these B&amp;R countries as the study group, and the other 73 countries (non-B&amp;R countries) as the control group. This study described EGs using the 54 6-digit code Environment Goods in Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System listed in the “APEC LIST OF ENVIRONMENT GOODS” published by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 2012, and used the intra-industry trade index proposed by Grubel and Lloyd in 1971 to measuring dependent variable. The research results indicated that the BRI has significantly promoted bilateral EGs IIT. The mechanism test implied that, in addition to direct impacts, the BRI also has indirect impacts by boosting the energy restructuring of B&amp;R countries. These results prove that the BRI has positive impacts on the environment. The heterogeneity test showed that there is a heterogeneous impact depending on the type of IIT, product categorization, B&amp;R countries’ income levels, and geographic environment. This study not only gives theoretical and empirical evidence of the positive environmental impacts of the BRI, but also provides practical guidance for the development of EGS IIT between China and B&amp;R countries, thereby contributing to global carbon emissions reduction and environmental governance to some degree.",2024-04-02,
"Price-making in provisioning systems and social-ecological transformation? The cases of the electric vehicle metals copper, cobalt, and lithium","Research and debates around mineral extraction in the context of social-ecological transformation have to date dedicated limited attention to price-making. Drawing on the provisioning systems approach, this article assesses price-making in mineral provisioning as contested processes. We argue that price-making is not an objective or solely technical process taking place on abstract markets but rather it is, first, reflective of power struggles over specific rules and devices between different actors, embedded in social relations, network practices, and institutions and, second, linked to the materialities of commodities and the territorial and organizational forms of their provisioning. Empirically, we analyze the ""electric vehicle metals"" copper, cobalt, and lithium for which derivative markets are intensifying their role as price-determination institutions linked particularly to the interest of financial actors in getting price exposure. The article criticizes current shifts to benchmark- and derivative markets-based price-determination. This approach focuses on short-term demand and supply considerations without considering local producer-region production specificities, broader economic impacts, and environmental and social costs and risks. Moreover, it fails to address the long-term insecurities related to resource depletion. With financial actors dominating price-determination on derivative markets, prices deviate even from such a narrow fundamental demand and supply perspective, increasing volatility and short-termism. Alternative price-making mechanisms are needed, together with other policies for social-ecological transformation which requires political regulation embedded in democratic decision-making. Methodologically, the article is based on production, trade, and financial data and semi-structured interviews with representatives of price-determination institutions, metal-provisioning systems, and producer countries.",2024-04-02,
The Impact of COVID-19 Epidemic on the Hedging Islamic and Conventional Stock Markets with Financial Assets,"This study investigates optimal hedging ratios for Islamic and conventional stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic using the DCC (Dynamic Conditional Correlation), ADCC (Asymmetric Dynamic Conditional Correlation), and GO-GARCH (Generalized Orthogonal GARCH) models. The effectiveness of various financial assets as hedges is evaluated, and findings indicate that the DJCOM (Dow Jones Commodity), VISTOXX (Euro STOXX 50 Volatility Index), and VIX (Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index) indices exhibit superior effectiveness across both market types, particularly DJCOM showing exceptional performance during the COVID-19 period. The hedging analysis indicates that the hedge ratios vary and depend upon the hedge instrument included in the portfolio. Furthermore, the empirical results indicate that the global impact of the pandemic diminishes the viability of one of the six assets as a safe haven instrument. In conclusion, these findings provide valuable insights for investors and portfolio managers aiming to utilize Gold, Brent, VISTOXX, VIX, CDS (Credit Default Swap), and DJCOM for portfolio rebalancing to mitigate risks associated with volatile Islamic and conventional stock returns. These conclusions contribute significantly to helping investors adjust their investment strategies more effectively and adapt to changing market conditions.",2024-04-02,
Tokenized Assets on Public Blockchains: How Transparent is the Blockchain?,"With the proliferation of programmable blockchains with smart contract capabilities, new blockchain technology use cases have emerged that involve the tokenization of conventional financial assets and related smart contract-based financial services. While early blockchains like Bitcoin introduced native cryptocurrencies as new asset classes, in recent years, market participants have noted the potential for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to be used to trade tokenized versions of bonds, money funds, and commodities, among other assets (GFMA, 2023, p. 6).",2024-04-01,

It's very clear that I had to be here. I still don't know why. Today I am longko, but I don't know if that's the reason.○ ○ ○Flor is telling me a fábula. A journalist and researcher specializing in social-environmental issues and my advisor on this project, Flor and I spend our time in the car closing the cultural, contextual, and idiomatic gaps that I have yet to grasp after three months in Argentina. She also tells me Mapuche fables.We pass between Río Negro and Neuquén on the highway and the coarse Patagonic scenery tumbles beyond the panes of our windows.When her lover becomes ill, a Mapuche woman mounts the cerro in search of an herbal remedy. Once on the mountain peak, the cóndor tells her that the price for the medicine is her heart.She agrees, saves her lover's life, and ascends the mountain once more. Soon after, the vulture is seen flying away with her heart in his beak.Amancays are a yellow flor del bosque.4According to Mapuche legend, the red drops of its center signify the blood of our heroine's heart.Es patriarcal, Flor says as she pushes on her sunglasses.○ ○ ○In 2006, the Argentine government declared a state of emergency to halt Indigenous evictions across the country. Provinces were instructed to survey territories with their local native communities and ideally, officially recognize their claims; while the law has been extended three separate times to provide provincial governments time to initiate the process, it never reached politically taut regions like Neuquén (Yanniello 2020).The Mapuche lof Kinxikew have faced two eviction attempts in the last decade from proprietors who believed they had private ownership of ancestral lands. I visit Amancay and her community on November 14, 2022. In accordance with Ley 26.160, the historic relevamiento de la tierra begins.○ ○ ○As Flor and I pull through the gate and onto the territory, there is an outpour of people from the proveeduría, the circular operations building for camping administration. Framed in glass panes, it outlooks Lago Nahuel Huapi and Manke Ruka, the nearest mountain: Home of the Vulture.Amancay's mother, Nora, greets me as I open the car door.La escritora, she says as she kisses both of my cheeks. The writer.We cross the grass to Amancay's partner as he grapples with a hose. ¡Mucho viento! he yells over the shake of the trees. Much wind!The primary meeting of the land survey has adjourned, so the group mills about and we lap them, kissing both of their cheeks. The lof Melo, a smaller and more recently established community, are under the protection of the lof Kinxikew and participate in the relevamiento to certify their territory. I met with them during a previous visit to Patagonia. Vientísmo! they call to me.In our car ride, Flor had explained to me that November is el mes de viento, the month of wind, across Patagonia. The heavy clouds twist on the skyline; the snow-drenched peaks seem to teeter.Flor offers me her cup of mate as we wait outside of the proveeduría for Amancay. Es demasiado amagro para vos? It's too bitter for you? she shouts and I shake my head.As far as I can tell, the cultural and social hub of Argentina is the practice of communal-infusion through ""taking mate"": sipping the herb through a silver straw, or bombillo, after combining it with lukewarm water. The cluster of people pass mate between each other.Many Argentines claim its conception originated from European settlers in the 1800s. But like most things, taking mate was born within Indigenous populations and previous to the constitution of the State.We're told that she's ready, so Flor and I push our way through the draught and into the darkened room. A paper map hangs on the wall: the product of today's meeting. Colorful lines and crude drawings identify areas of the territory.Lafún y La laguna del toro; Río pedregoso y Piedra de soldados; Arroyo las vueltas; Camping Manke Ruka; avistamiento del cuero; usurpador Ovrun.The Lafún and the Lagoon of Offering; Stony River and the Rock of Soldiers; the Returns Creek, Camping Manke Ruka; the sighting of the leather; and the Ovrun usurper.They have to prove to the State that they were here, long before the State ever existed.○ ○ ○A lesson in Mapudungún, the Mapuche language.El Wallmapu. Ancestral territory of the Indigenous nations of the Mapuche which crosses the highlands of the Andes.Los mapu-che. People of the land.Mapu-dungún. Language of the land.As the Mapuche longko and researcher Wenteche José Quidel writes,""We are not only referring to material land, because that exists in the concept Pvji Mapu. Mapu is a term that implies all the dimensions of life within the universe. That is to say, we can understand the cosmos as Mapu"" (Matías Rendón 2018).Another word: winka.Los conquistadores of the sixteenth century. Originally signifying the white race. It stems from the word Inka referring to a different colonizer, a different empire that once arrived to El Wallmapu.El Wallmapu is a region spanning the base of the Southern Hemisphere, extending through parts of Chile and Argentina long before the first winkas invented their territorial delimitations.El Wallmapu is not a territory, explicitly; its aboriginal people now steward only 6 percent of its terrain. It holds the history of conquest, and the modernity of its material exploitation. Private sectors want to convert its mountains to mines of gold and silver, its biodiversity to monoculture forests. How can we conceptualize of a place that once was? That has within it buried an ancient knowledge and collective memory?Amancay is trying to remember.○ ○ ○Yo sabía que mi destino iba a llegar algún día, pero nunca pensé que iba a ser tan rápido.Amancay sits in a chair across the room, the quivering land framed behind her head in the windowpane. She began by giving her formal introduction in Mapudungún, which is how she initiates all meetings. The room is lined with family members who sleepily half-listen; her three-year-old son, Toki, circles her with a plastic gun. The room is cool and dark and cast in the shadow of Manke Ruka.Authority elections were coming up. I talked to my family first. My dad said, ""I'll go with you,"" and my mom said, ""Me too.""I believe that to be an authority, or to have such strong authority, you need a solid base, which is family. And that base was always there in the worst moments and continues to be there today.My uncle brought me to the community; he told me, ""You have to come with me.""My uncle brought me here and made me know my family because I didn't know them, and he made me know my identity.I could see with my eyes a dream I had since I was very young, a dream of the path.I am grateful for everything he gave me and for the place he gave me here in the territory, but I also have to be honest that he hurt me a lot.Because at one point, he felt that I was like him.In 2020, her uncle was banished from the community, resulting in Amancay's ascent to the role of longko.○ ○ ○From across the room, Amancay's other uncle tells us the fable of the boleadora, which was found on the grounds of the territory. A bola consists of a cord tethered to rock weights; initially a weapon to entangle the legs of prey, it was a popular tool across Indigenous South America.When the winkas arrived to Bariloche, boleadoras became a form of protection and defense. Fue la última resistencia tuvieron, Amancay says. It was the last resistance they had.○ ○ ○The Conquest of the ""Desert,"" from 1878 to 1885, was an Indigenous genocide by part of the Argentine military, commanded by General Julio A. Roca. The South's native populations were to be exterminated for the betterment of a developing Eurocentric state. Roca's forces conducted concentration camps, torture, assassination, enslavement, and desparecidos, or disappeared persons (Melfi 2015). Today, there exists a delegitimization campaign sustained by racist ideals and nationalists with the false premise of extranjerización or ""foreignization"" of Mapuche communities: that is, that they are Chilean usurpers without ancestral claim to El Puelmapu5 (Crespo et al. 2021).It was impossible to remove us completely. And those who resisted were sent to live on top of El Cerro, like my family, because the Nahuel Huapi National Park became criminalized. The park put our family in the category of settlers and gave us a precarious permit to occupy the passages. They gave us a little piece of paper saying that we only had the status of settlers and that we had to pay for the grazing of our animals.We became nothing. And on top of that we had to pay them. We needed to adopt a new way of living, of eating, because here the farmers already had plantations and animals, and suddenly they closed everything with wire fences. They turned us into their own employees. . . . Many of our family ended up being the women who took care of their children, or the men who had to put up the fences in our own territory.Then, on top of that, they had to hide their identity. They spoke Mapudungún. They did ceremonies in places where nobody could see them. It was a loss of cultural history that cut with my grandfather. He taught us everything that has to do with the knowledge of the territory, he knows everything. But never about identity. We never had a lesson of Mapudungún, he never told us anything that they did [in terms of] being Mapuche.Children and adults alike learn Mapudungún and practice the spiritual and medicinal traditions of their ancestors as acts of cultural restoration. But much of the knowledge has been generationally lost in an attempt at survival.○ ○ ○On our drive home, Flor pulls to the lip of the highway which cuts through la meseta, or plateau. Its shrubs and sands unfold flatly. All I can hear is the scorch of the wind on this hard place.Beyond, peaks clot the fondo,6 engulfed in mountainous shadow.This is where the battles once took place, where conquistadores met Mapuche, firearms en contra de boleadoras. Mapuche en contra del Estado.Fue la última resistencia tuvieron.It was the last resistance they had.Back in the car, Flor tells me that nothing has changed: the heart of the conflict is still firearms against bolas for Patagonia's disputed frontier.○ ○ ○The beach rocks shift under our feet.As we walk the shoreline of the Lago Nahuel Huapi, Flor distinguishes plant species for me. El sauce, the willow that mirages in the breeze; las rosas mosquetas, sweetbriars which won't ripen until winter comes. On our drives, flowering retamas ornate the highway in yellowing buds. But they're not native to this area, and neither are the pines that engulf the bosques or the poplar trees that lined Amancay's pewma.Planted in the 1970s to quickly reforest the farmlands of the steppe, Douglas firs and other pine species now burn faster and enhance climate-induced wildfires (Bilbao 2022). Patagonia's vegetal biodiversity could be reduced entirely to pine in the next hundred years (Leitch 2017).○ ○ ○Argentina's nineties marked the emergence of a new political and financial strategy: neo-extractivism and agro-exportation. The diffusion of neoliberal ideology encouraged privatization of land (at the cost of the displacement of Indigenous communities) and the lack of governmental interference and publicly funded programs. The growth of an exportation economy matched rising demand for commodities in the West (Harvey 2005).With the false promise of financial satiation after prolonged economic crisis, the Argentine State initiated its expansion into, and exploitation of, rural lands deemed previously unprosperous: El Wallmapu (Svampa 2019).○ ○ ○Another fable.Amancay's abuelo, José, once rested upon the rocky shore of the Lago Nahuel Huapi and beside the slope of Manke Ruka.The ground began to shift under him and he realized that, rather than perching on the usual gravel, the beachfront was leather. It was alive.Then, it tossed him into the center of the lago.○ ○ ○In Mapuche cosmovision, ngen are the spiritual forces of El Wallmapu. They reify in order to communicate. In this case, the ngen-ko serves as a sacred reminder. Amidst environmental crisis, Mapuche belief systems propose alternative methods of coexistence (Yanniello 2009).Biodiversity is threatened today by large speculators and large political forces that do not care about anything at the cost of being able to generate more money. For us, it is not money: it is life that we remember.There is no love; life is not worth anything to them. The important thing is to have more and more property, more and more money, and above all, they don't care about anything.On the other hand, our proposal is kvme felen.There are other proposals of life, where the first priority is love, caring for others and caring for nature. We see ourselves in a space surrounded by life, and that life is in the lake, the mountains, the forest.We are working for a totally different political project, another form of social construction.Life is not about competing, life is about living and being happy, isn't it? Because that is what we were born for, but no. You see so many injustices, you see so much evil in people.○ ○ ○The Patagonic region of El Wallmapu is in stages of exploration: deposits of gold, silver, and uranium; petrolic exploitation using hydrofracking techniques; deforestation and monoculture forests. But with threats of overexploitation and ecosystemic collapse, communal mobilization has stopped advances of these initiatives in recent years (Rodriguéz Pardo 2011). And yet, still they come.Twenty kilometers away, in the central and northern zones of the Neuquén province, new petroleum reserves have been found underneath the territories of Mapuche communities.○ ○ ○This alternative social construction takes form as the Manke Ruka camping site, where the community offers an affordable, educational space; guests receive lessons on Mapuche ways of life and ancestral practices of caring for the land.They are also planning an outreach program for farming, where agricultural processes will be made accessible, where people can learn where their dulce de leche comes from, as Amancay puts it.Roca made a map.He decided how he was going to distribute all the territory, but he also decided a place where he was going to create national parks, that is, places protected by an institution.It turns out that when he thought and divided all the territory, we were still here. And still, they continue to replicate that logic in the Mapuche territories.They teach park rangers that we have to conserve the native animals of the place, but when they meet and come to work where we live, they realize that there are people and that, for them, we are an attack against all that biodiversity.We bring our knowledge ancestrally.But it is difficult for them to understand our relationship with the territory. They see us as a great threat and, despite the fact that today there is a relationship between the national parks and the Mapuche people, how can we understand these two logics of protecting the territory?Therefore, it is constantly constructing itself through a dialogue that is exhausting. Sometimes they forget and end up fining us for something that we don't consider valid.I am the one in my community who is always trying to ensure that my people do not have a conflict with park rangers.El Consejo Intercultural de Comanejo attempts to incorporate this native knowledge into the stewardship of the land by including Mapuche board members. But in general, conservationists distrust Mapuche means of land stewardship because it falls outside of Western frameworks of knowledge and practice.At one point as she speaks, she turns to Flor: La cara. The face. She laughs, asking if I'm understanding.Entiendo todo, I assure her, even as an outsider with questionable language comprehension. Even if I'm not entirely certain that I'm telling the truth.○ ○ ○I wander the sleet-shined streets of Bariloche, which slope downward to Avenida 12 de Octubre and the long road paralleling Lago Nahuel Huapi. The view sprawls, mountain ranges consumed by the frail blues of a cold sky and the dappling water. I stand listening to the slow lap of waves cresting coastline.Bariloche self-advertises as the ""Little Switzerland"" of Patagonia. It's a tourist hub of outdoor sporting gear, gothic-style villas, chocolaterías, and neon hotel signage promising vacancy.Bariloche-goers seem entirely made up of either the retired or backpacking postgraduates. But the town is surrounded on all sides by poverty, nearly half of which are Mapuche communities.Virulofche. La gente del otro lado de la montaña. The people on the other side of the mountain. The name ""Bariloche"" toponymies from Mapudungún.In the town's plaza, tourists gaze out over the bruising skyline. I'm looking for an allusion to the cultural hurt behind ""Little Switzerland's"" neat image: and then I find, in the center of the plaza, a Roca statue mounted on a horse and drenched in the red graffiti of blood.Anyone want maté-cito? Flor asks.We sit at a picnic table outside. I was told that Bariloche finally decided to give me a beautiful day, and it's true: we are in short sleeves and sleepy under the sunlight's sweet gaze.Amancay taps out a heartbeat on her chest: Toc-toc, toc-toc. The noise of a heartbeat is distinct, isn't it?I listen to the thud of her palm and the tap of her tongue against the roof of her mouth—her pulse turned outward to me.Our heart beats differently at certain moments. When it is calm, it makes toc-toc, toc-toc.When one is with a lot of emotion, it makes tac-tac-tac.Amancay is describing the kultrún she plays, a sacred Mapuche percussion instrument that replicates heart sounds. The leather of the drum is painted geographically and seasonally: norte, oeste, este, y sur; otoño, primavera, invierno y verano.When I was nineteen years old, my uncle brought me here. I was studying tourism at that time. He made me meet the rest of my family.Amancay's grandmother died giving birth to Amancay's mother, Nora, so her grandfather, José Quintriqueo, gave her away.He [her uncle] always knew me, he always saw in me the possibility that I could accompany him in also generating a change in the territory. And from that moment on, everything changed . . . everything changed.Her younger self, the one who existed long before she knew her Mapuche heritage, she affectionately refers to as Mankey.7 I feel that girl here with us, as Amancay describes making music under the hum of the life all around us.I was always very fearful as a girl.I realized that those insecurities didn't let me be who I am, so Mankey has to let go of those insecurities because she can do a lot.I am capable of generating well-being for many people; I feel that I can make an impact on many. So I have lost my fear and that loss of fear has made me able to do many things that I would never have believed I was capable of.I had never thought I would be so valued and so loved for having, at least, changed someone's life a little bit. Mankey's going to have to know that in the future.A horse wanders by, picking at the grasses.But Mankey always saw a dream when she fell asleep.The paseo of her dreams was a point of entrance for the evictors that came for the land. It was also the pathway the community took to reenter the territory upon their return.○ ○ ○Amancay and I sink into the verdancy around us. I ask her if she was named for the fable of the Amancay. But no, no; her mother just liked the flower.Es romántica, she tells me, and she smiles.She's preoccupied with the idea that no one is documenting this period of great restoration, and histories are disappearing, just as they did with her grandfather.Can she describe the moment she met her family? Saw her land? But she can't tell me of her homecoming—she's lost it all to memory.You recreate it like a fable.What I am proposing to you is that you also give yourself the audacity to interpret it as you would have imagined it. I trust you.Kvme felen, in Mapuche cosmovision, proposes an alternative way of life to the capitalist system.It does not contain territorial exploitation, cultural devastation, or spiritual eviction; no hyper-consumption and overproduction and materialism.This way of life asks for the restoration of equilibrium. It suggests the ability to understand ourselves as inseparable from nature, as well as our own capacity for agricultural self-sustenance. The delicate web of nature is revived; love's gentle balance centralized (Confederación Mapuche del Neuquén 2010).It feels like home without property, like a great return of environmental consonance. It is how El Wallmapu once looked, long before any winkas. It is the toc-toc, toc-toc of the heartbeat of the world, made tranquil again.That is how her homecoming felt to me.○ ○ ○Our spirit does not always go with this body. Sometimes it leaves and goes places where we like to be. He loved to be here, despite all the damage. He fought a lot for it and so his pini keeps coming back.Amancay breastfeeds her son while she describes her election to longko. It did not follow the cultural trajectory of spiritual appointment: rather, it was a democratic process that came during communal crisis. Her uncle and former longko was exposed as having sexually abused eight minors within the community.It was done to eight people, boys and girls, some of them are still young and some of them are already adults, but it ruined their lives. What's more, they decided to file a complaint in the middle of the pandemic.It is very difficult for them to be part of our community circles, it is very difficult for them to think about a family project, to think about a productive project.Today, they have been able to recover, that is, they have their partners, they have their children, but nevertheless, I still see a certain pain in them that I don't know how to remedy.We had to expel him from the community and tell him never to come back to the territory. But there is still an open wound.For me it was very painful, the process has been very intense for me as a person, as a niece.Because I loved him a lot.The communal response to this was the democratic election of a nearly all female, generationally youthful council of leadership.I believe that change comes from the youth, right?Both she and Flor seem fixed on telling me that it's me who's just a girl, solo una chica. But in moments like these, as she switches her son from one nipple to the other, she seems impossibly young for the cost of the world she is building.We want him to go away and leave us alone once and for all. We need that tranquility. We decided to rebuild a community circle that he was in charge of destroying.And for that he has to go, and thank you.○ ○ ○Amancay pats it out gently for me against her skin. Toc-toc, toc-toc, she's clicking her tongue and the canopies lift in the wind. She knows the sound of a tranquil heart, and she plays the kultún in search of it.On the last day of the relevamiento, the community takes lunch outdoors, with tortas fritas and mate. Amancay is laughing:Yo no estoy cansada, ni estresada, y ni hice nada. I'm not tired, nor stressed, and I didn't do anything.She seems relieved to be able to rest placidly with us at our picnic table. We pass our mate and watch the waxen sky. A fire snaps under the grill; people sprawl on the grass with their hats over their eyes.This survey is not going to guarantee anything.On an outbreath, Amancay confesses that, in just the same way that provincial governments permitted eviction attempts despite the federal law forbidding it, the territory is still under threat until a law of communal property is passed through the State.This type of law threatens Bariloche, a place rooted in private property and burgeoning real estate.Solo un freno. It's only a brake.But there's so much joy tossed up into this weatherly pause from the month of wind. We watch her son drag around a fallen branch while the whole landscape seems to undulate.The only way is a law of community property that allows us generational continuity, so that it is not cut. Right now, I don't know if I can pass it on to my son.That is the only thing we are asking for. Because if not, the truth is that they are coming.They are coming for the air; they are coming for the minerals.○ ○ ○The group calls together for an afafan, and I feel honored to be present.The afafan is a communal ritual that comes in the face of great celebration, gratitude, loss.They circle and throw their fists in the air: Marici Wew! Marici Wew! Marici Wew! Diez veces estamos vivos, diez veces venceremos. Ten times we are alive, ten times we win.When we scream, we understand.Before the relevamiento, the community had gathered at their Lëfün, a sacred ceremonial space that protects from the snow, rain, and wind. Amancay and her young nephew describe to me the slant of the morning light, the sacrificial crescents, the delicate reciprocity with spiritual forces; why they bring maitén and manzano as offerings. But this sacredity should not be described by me: you'll just have to have the audacity to interpret it as you would have imagined it.La única lucha que se pierda es la que abandona. The only fight you lose is the one you abandon.○ ○ ○It's the month of wind in El Wallmapu, and private sectors move in on petroleum deposits; land is sold and bought and sequestered. But there are boleadoras to be found, little girls who dream of paseo.And it's spring, so the year's flowers begin their blossom; trailing highways, lost in forests, even sprouting within Bariloche's corners of dirt.To me, this seems lucky.Because in El Wallmapu, flowers come with fables.○ ○ ○Mari mari pu lamgen, mari mari kom pu ce, ince Amancay Quintriqueo pigen.

Fiscal dominance and the financial resource curse: The Paradoxes of Plenty and Banking,"This article models banking under the condition of fiscal dominance or monetised-fiscal deficits, and explains why resource-based economies experience a financial resource curse. The evidence shows that commodity price shocks engender premature deindustrialisation, reduce loan-deposit ratios and increase interest rate spreads, among other banking pathologies. The model demonstrates that commodity booms are accompanied by monetisation shocks as these explain accelerating bank deposits, interest costs, and persistent non-borrowed and non-remunerated reserves in the banking system. In turn, these lower the bank's profit margin (profitsdeposits), liquidity (bondsdeposits), and capital adequacy ratios (capitalloans). Therefore, the bank raises (lowers) its lending (deposit) rate to satisfy banking regulations without compromising profits. Thus, fiscal dominance reduces (raises) the loan-deposit ratio (interest rate spread). Moreover, the model shows that fiscal dominance increases the bank's share of consumer loans as a defensive measure against rising interest costs or non-bank competition, and triggers an unstable boom in property prices.",2024-04-01,
The Challenges and opportunities of entering a new international market : Research the potential barriers in a new international market for a specific company or product,"During the initial wave of globalization prior to the 1920s, Western multinationals made enormous investments in emerging countries.Deglobalization led to a drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing nations, which has stayed below pre-1914 levels since the 1980s. The working paper demonstrates how context affected management methods in each historical time, resulting in a combination of opportunity and danger. During the first wave of globalization, multinational enterprises (MNEs) used government contracts and advantageous arrangements to get access to resources and establish operations. The main managerial problem was overcoming logistical barriers to export minerals and commodities into global value chains. During the Great Reversal, the biggest hurdles for MNEs were political. Firms should establish political relations with forceful host governments and reinforce their local identities, including localizing management. There was minimal need to alter products for highly protected markets or limited local competition. Liberalization and elimination of anti-foreign prohibitions have reduced political dangers in today's global economy. However, business strategy must carefully handle relationships with governments. MNEs in all industries now recognize the importance of emerging markets, particularly those in Asia and Latin America. They served as a manufacturing hub for lower-end global value chains, as well as a rapidly expanding market. There was an increasing need to integrate local relevance into global offerings and respond to local rivals.There is no consensus on when the current age of globalization began.The origins of this phenomenon may be traced back to the 1960s, when global financial markets emerged and challenged national prohibitions on money mobility.The new global economy may be traced back to China's embrace of market-oriented policies in 1978, rather than the political issues that led to deglobalization.China's economic success prompted other developing countries, particularly India, to follow suit by 1991.The rise of right-wing, free market administrations in Britain and the United States in 1979 and 1980, as well as the demise of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, paved the way for global capitalism and foreign investment.In the 1990s, the World Wide Web and the digital age accelerated globalization.",2024-04-01,
ANALISIS RANTAI PASOKAN MENTIMUN DI PASAR INDUK KOTA SURAKARTA,"Agricultural commodities have supply chain flows from upstream to downstream, namely from producers to consumers. The need for vegetables in the city of Surakarta must be met by the surrounding area because of the limited agricultural land in the city of Surakarta itself. One of the vegetable commodities supplied is cucumber. Therefore, it is important to know the flow of the cucumber supply chain in the Central Market of Surakarta City. The research method used is descriptive quantitative. The research location was chosen purposively, namely the Central Market of Surakarta City (Pasar Gede and Pasar Legi). The sampling technique used snowball sampling to collect informants consisting of farmers, collectors, wholesalers and retailers and incidental sampling with the Slovin formula so that the number of respondents was 77 traders. Data collection techniques using interviews, questionnaires, and documentation. Data analysis used descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression test. The results of this study are 1) there are 6 flows of goods in the supply chain with farmers, collectors, wholesalers, retail traders andconsumers, the financial flow is divided into 2, namely early and late repayment and the flow of information occurs in 2 directions, namely information from farmers to traders. (cucumber availability and transaction mechanisms) and from traders to farmers (price developments). 2) the majority of traders supply cucumbers of 350 – 586 kg. 3) thefactors that have a significant effect on the supply volume of cucumbers in the Central Market of Surakarta City areprice, profit, transportation, supplier area and quality.",2024-04-01,
Initial Public Offering,"Groups work toward common objectives.Many distinct kinds of organizations exist.Every company has to keep an eye on and manage these four core internal operations.There are a number of ways to raise money.In finance, an IPO is short for ""public offering"" or first public offering.Going public may be done in a variety of ways, and investing in an initial public offering (IPO) is not without its risks.This is a viable option for every business that wants to go public.The easy purchase and sale of financial securities commodities is made possible by a financial market.Issuance of new securities is the main focus of the capital markets.If you're looking to buy or sell stocks that have already been offered in an IPO or other initial public offering, you should look into the secondary market.The role of financial institutions is to mediate transactions between the debt and capital markets.In initial public offerings (IPOs), plenty of firms succeed and others fail.",2024-04-01,
"Consuming Italian: Transatlantic Actors and Infrastructures of Italian Exports to Postwar America, 1957–1962","If one were to trust this statement made in 1960 by the Bourbon Institute, there might be good grounds for reversing the classical dominant narrative on the postwar Americanization of Italy and considering, rather, the parallel Italianization of American society, or, more properly, for reframing the Americanization narrative as a two-way process defined by mutual influences and exchanges. The Bourbon Institute article, in fact, goes on to argue that ""we have so many tastes in common with Italians that we believe they might find a welcome for one of our great traditions. It's called Bourbon Whiskey and in the United States it is a social institution"" (Trade with Italy 1960h). Bringing to the forefront Americans' increasing enthusiasm for Italian products and styles was thus intended to support the further spread of American products and ""great traditions."" American items could easily spread in Italy, it was argued, because Italians and Americans already had similar tastes.This is, however, an overstatement, evidently animated by the Bourbon Institute's will to pursue its commercial purposes within the specific context provided by Trade with Italy, the monthly magazine of the American Chamber of Commerce for Trade with Italy. There is no doubt that the diffusion and influence of Made in Italy products and tastes in the United States, while growing after 1945, never equaled the scope and transformative power of American models, methods, and consumer products, which fundamentally affected Italian society during the Cold War decades. The asymmetrical nature of the exchange does not, however, belie the fact that after World War II American consumers became more and more familiar with Italian products. In buying and consuming Italian goods, they also took part in Italy's postwar effort to rebrand its international image and extend its commercial and cultural influence as a modern nation. The Bourbon Institute's assessment, then, although exaggerated, hints at developments that were actually underway. The diffusion and influence of Italian goods on the American market, while not new per se (Italian products and ways had arrived in the United States alongside Italian immigrants at least since the late nineteenth century), acquired a new meaning and scope in the postwar decades, leaving a mark on American consumer society. In this context, statements like the ones above were not isolated. On the contrary, a documentary distributed by the Italian newsreel company INCOM between 1950 and 1960 similarly echoed, from the other side of the Atlantic: ""Questo è il momento dell'Italia in America. . . la linea italiana occupa oggi un posto di assoluto rilievo, l'americano, se così possiamo dire, si italianizza"" (INCOM 1950–1960; This is the moment of Italy in America. . . . In today's America the Italian line has a place of absolute importance. Even in the smallest aspects of daily life, the American—we might say—is increasingly Italianized).1Claims like those made by the Bourbon Institute are in line with the historiographical interpretation of Europe's postwar Americanization as a two-way process subject to forms of ""selective appropriations"" (Kuisel 1993; Wagnleitner 1994; Kroes 1996; Pells 1997; Nolan 2012; Ellwood 2012).2 The present article also builds on the existing studies of the impact and development of Made in Italy among Americans after World War II. These have sprung from a series of important initiatives dedicated to Italian styles, design, and products between the late 1940s and the early 1950s (e.g., the exhibition on Italian modern art at the Museum of Modern Art in 1949, the itinerant exhibition Italy at Work: Her Renaissance in Design Today in 1950, or Macy's Italian fair in 1951) to cast light on how new representations of Italy and new American perceptions of what ""Italy"" stood for gradually transformed the country's public image along with Americans' taste for things Italian (Bedarida 2016; Dellapiana 2018).3Most analyses of Made in Italy's postwar impact in the United States have focused on either the elaboration of a new transatlantic discourse on ""Italianness,"" or they have looked at specific sectors of Italian industrial production and manufacturing—first and foremost Italian fashion and industrial design—and at their growing appeal among Americans (Gundle 2007; Scrivano 2013; Bettiol 2015; Paulicelli 2017; Benini 2018; Belfanti 2019). In addition, several scholars have effectively considered the important contribution made by Italian Americans, with their habits, products, and customs, to spread Italian ways in the United States and thus to shape American consumer society (Cinotto 2013, 2014; Sciorra and Ruberto 2017). There is nonetheless still quite a shortage of studies addressing the question of exactly which Italian products arrived in the United States, in what amount, through which commercial networks they were distributed, in which contexts of American consumption, and in which relation to the parallel and substantially greater flow of American products and models directed to Italy. This article aims at opening a first window on these aspects, while connecting them to the broader theoretical framework provided by the theses of ""selective appropriation"" and mutual influences.Was the postwar American market for Italian products still fundamentally sustained by Italian Americans? To what extent was the average American consumer familiar with and prone to consume Italian items? Which public institutions and private enterprises intermediated in Italian products entering the United States? How were these products promoted, and what were the main limits to their diffusion? Even more important, what impact did Italian products and models have on American tastes and society, and what was the relation of this westward flow to the parallel Americanization of Italian society? This article addresses these questions with no expectation of providing an exhaustive analysis, but rather attempts to offer a series of possible answers, thereby soliciting further investigation.The Bourbon Institute's (over)statement itself provides a first and partial response, pointing to the growing presence and popularity of Italian food, Italian fashion items and designs, and Italian cars in the United States, as well as to the important contribution given to their popularization by a series of Italian icons, especially film stars. As early as 1955, a study realized by the commercial office of the Italian embassy in the United States and published by the Italian Confindustria (i.e., Italy's largest business federation) had offered a positive assessment of Made in Italy's appeal among American consumers. It defined ""la cresente affermazione dei prodotti italiani negli SU come un fenomeno recente, ma che non ha riscontro in prodotti di altri paesi europei"" (Confederazione Generale dell'Industria Italiana 1955; the everyday greater success of Made in Italy products in the United States as a recent phenomenon having unparalleled intensity and matched by no other European country). Such success was mainly ascribed to the ""intrinseche qualità dei prodotti italiani"" (intrinsic qualities of Italian products), to ""la particolare ricettività del mercato Americano per ogni articolo di qualità ed originalità"" (the American market's receptiveness toward quality original items), and to the determinant role of American tourists, Italian fashion, and Italian films in popularizing many Italian products in America.4 The report's positive assessment was, however, counterbalanced by a call to more effectively organize networks of distribution and promotion of Italian exports across the United States.Within the broader context of Made in Italy's growing presence overseas, my analysis will support two main arguments. First, I believe that the postwar growth in circulation of Italian products in the United States was related to the parallel Americanization underway in Italy and thus to the United States' determinant contribution to Italy's economic reconstruction and modernization after 1945. Just as the many American goods and ways exported to Italy were able to succeed only by adapting to the needs, traditions, and habits of Italian consumers, Italian products' conquest of American hearts and minds required some form of adaptation to the US market.These parallel Italianizing/Americanizing trends also mandate, I argue, the adoption of a circulatory point of view when assessing the scope, impact, and nature of Italy's exports to the United States. Italian products and models moved through circulatory networks of mutual, although asymmetrical, influences between Italy and the United States. Their use and development were influenced by their American reception just as much as by the Italian context of their production, in a constant dynamic of production of new cultural meanings through consumption. In other words, the nature of Made in Italy's diffusion and impact on American society resulted not only from Italians' will to extend their cultural and commercial presence abroad but also from how Made in Italy was received and understood by the American public. Any consideration of its success in postwar America should therefore be complemented by an investigation of which Italian products arrived in the United States, how these products were advertised and how they spread, and where and by whom were they consumed.To this end, the article will focus on a specific phase of Italy's postwar history, that is, the years of its ""economic miracle,"" from approximately 1957 to 1962. This period represented a crucial moment in the postwar evolution of Italy-US relations and commercial exchanges, marking also a shift in the quantitative and qualitative composition of Italian exports to the United States.The year 1958 was a decisive moment both in Italian history and in terms of Italy-US relations. In his renowned study on Italy's economic miracle, historian Guido Crainz (2005) defines it as a ""border year."" The nation's reconstruction phase was officially over. Since 1945, Italian consumption had risen from Lit 2.499 billion to Lit 12.613 billion, while the value of Italian exports had gone from Lit 125 billion to Lit 2.467 billion (Italy Today 1962). The best was, however, yet to come. The following years would be defined by unprecedented rapid rates of growth, which—Crainz argues—radically altered Italians' financial outlooks and mindsets (87).5 Between 1957 and 1962, Italy definitively moved over its postwar reconstruction to see the gradual development of a modern consumer society, characterized by new forms of mass consumption and mobility. By 1960, more than two million cars and four million scooters crossed Italian roads, first and foremost the new Autostrada del Sole (the main highway running north-south connecting some of the major cities of the country). In the same year the autostrada was inaugurated, 1958, the Fiat Cinquecento won the Compasso d'oro award for best modern industrial design. Within a short period, 50 percent of the Italian population owned a refrigerator, and home appliance companies like Candy or Ariston joined firms like Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Piaggio, Necchi, Montecatini, and Olivetti as the main drivers of Italy's economic growth (Crainz 2005; Scarpellini 2008).6Many of these new consumer products participated in what historians would later identify as the postwar Americanization of Italian society (Ellwood 1985; Gundle and Guani 1986; D'Attorre 1991; Forgacs and Gundle 2008). In 1957, Nelson Rockefeller opened the first Italian supermarket in Milan (Scarpellini 2004; De Grazia 2006).7 The following year, L'Espresso (1958) tellingly defined the Lombard city as ""una piccola America"" (a little America), hinting at the rock 'n' roll mania of its younger population (see also Portelli 1985; Merolla 2011). New consumer habits were, however, not simply bringing the Italians closer to the Americans. They were also making the Italian population internally more homogeneous. In Giorgio Bocca's (1962) words, the new consumer society became an ideal ""factory"" to ""make the Italians."" This development went along with Americanizing trends, as well as with the Italianization of many American products and models, as exemplified by the Ariston company and Unibloc's Italian interpretation of the paradigmatic American kitchen.A series of symbolic episodes, starting from Domenico Modugno's win at the Sanremo Music Festival, seems to confirm 1958 as a beginning point for the intensification of Italianizing dynamics. This Italianization drive also crossed the Atlantic, influencing—to go back to the Bourbon Institute's statement—Americans' ""Italian-minded"" outlook as well as more balanced relations between the two nations. Modugno's ""Volare"" won two Grammy awards and was hailed in the United States as a ""tuneful import from Italy: the fastest growing success on all counts in the history of Hit Parade"" (Trade with Italy 1958f). The years 1957–1959 marked, in fact, the apex of Italy's postwar exports to America, to the point that New Yorker journalist Robert Coates (1957) claimed, ""The contemporary Italians, so little noticed in this country only a few years ago, have been advancing upon us with startling rapidity."" A quick survey across the pages of Trade with Italy, alongside the reports of the Italian embassy's commercial counselors, confirms the steady growth of Italian exports, making the US Italy's second-largest foreign market, after West Germany (Ministero Commercio Estero 1959c; Trade with Italy 1956e, 1958c). According to the Italian ambassador to the United States, trade relations between Italy and the United States reached an ""all-time peak in 1957,"" when Italian exports totaled $244 million (Brosio 1958). By the end of 1958, that amount had risen to $273,786,307 (Trade with Italy 1959d).8 Such improvement gained even greater importance as it was matched by a parallel 16 percent reduction of US exports to Italy, and thus a reduction of the Italian deficit in the US-Italy trade balance (Trade with Italy 1959b; 1960b).9On a political level, the years 1957–1958 inaugurated the season of Italy's ""neoatlantismo,"" inspired by figures like Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, President Giovanni Gronchi, and ENI founder Enrico Mattei. Such a political line called for Italy's increased autonomy (from the United States) in foreign policy, while also, however, reasserting its adherence to the North Atlantic alliance (Gaja 1995; Serri 2009; Ateneo 2015). To express such simultaneous emancipation from and closeness to the United States, Fanfani (1958) adopted the metaphor of ""a bridge across the Atlantic,"" reclaiming Italy's status ""among the most advanced nations,"" and encouraging consideration of Europe and the United States as components of a single and indivisible Western world.10 Within this framework, Italy's modernization achievements were presented as a positive case of Americanization that fit the European context and could thus offer a link between the two macroregional blocs, even more so on the wave of the 1957 Treaty of Rome.Such a vision of Italy's mediatory role between Western Europe and the United States found expression also at the commercial level. As one could read on the menu for an Italian breakfast organized in San Francisco by the Italian American Chamber of Commerce: ""Italian Line links all the Americas with all of Europe via the Mediterranean"" (Ministero Commercio Estero 1959d). Moving from these assumptions, in 1957 the Italian Ministry of Foreign Trade officially ""initiated a program for the promotion of Italian exports to the United States"" (Trade with Italy 1957a).11 The elaboration of a Made in Italy public discourse identifying ""Italianness"" as a source of added value to the country's industrial production, able to preserve Italy's tradition of craftsmanship even in an American-like system of industrial mass production, was functional to both rebranding Italy's international image and extending its market competitiveness.In 1959, Italian exports to the United States continued to soar by 43 percent, bringing about a further reduction of Italy's trade deficit with the United States. The expectations for the following years were consequently high, also in light of the upcoming 1960 Olympic Games in Rome and the plans for celebrating the centennial of Italy's unification in 1961. This latter occasion, in particular, allowed for the largest cultural and commercial exhibition dedicated to Italy in the United States up until that moment: the Festival of Italy, held in Philadelphia's Commercial Museum from January 21 to March 26, 1961. The ""massive ten-week cultural program"" resulted from the joint effort of some key actors in Made in Italy's success overseas, including the local Board of Trade and Conventions, Italy's Foreign Trade Ministry, all of the Italian Trade Institute's offices in the United States, and a wide array of Italian corporations (Trade with Italy 1961g; Rassegna Economico Commerciale sugli Stati Uniti 1961e). The festival featured numerous events and expositions, from folkloristic Italian dances, displays of ""fine arts and traditional crafts,"" home furnishings from the Triennale, and special exhibitions of Olivetti and Fiat to an extensive program of concerts, motion pictures, and performing arts involving key Italian and Italian American figures (Rassegna Economico Commerciale sugli Stati Uniti 1961d; Ministero Commercio Estero 1962a).The success of the festival—which received a large amount of press coverage and was visited by more than 250,000 people—seems, however, to contrast with simultaneous reports on Italy-US trade developments. Between 1960 and 1961, trade relations between Italy and the US went through ""a dramatic turn-about,"" moving in what was defined as ""an abnormal direction"" (Rassegna Commerciale 1961a; Trade with Italy 1961c). As US exports to Italy increased, Italian exports to the United States declined, resulting in ""the first balance of payments deficit in recent years"" (Trade with Italy 1962e).12 However, a closer look at what evolutions in the composition of Italian exports determined this development reveals Italian products' actual capacity to influence the American market. On the one hand, the rise of American exports to Italy (mostly cotton and coal) was itself the result of the ""booming domestic expansion of Italy"" (Trade with Italy 1961c). On the other hand, the decrease in Italian exports was due to a drop in three specific sectors: wool fabrics, steel items, and, mostly, Italian automobiles, whose market was negatively affected by the new competition of American-made compact cars.13 The success in the US of European small cars (which implied different notions and practices of mobility compared to larger American cars) had in fact impacted one of the nation's largest economic sectors, forcing Americans to catch up with their domestic production. This consideration acquires even greater relevance if collated with data showing the increase of all other main US imports from Italy, first and foremost textiles and wearing apparel, leather goods, and food products (Rassegna Economico Commerciale sugli Stati Uniti, 1961a). Moreover, by the end of 1962 American imports from Italy had already begun to grow again, determining a new reduction of the trade deficit and giving new confidence in Made in Italy's bright future. An analysis of the main actors, the leading products and brands, and the various consumers sustaining such growing flows will confirm this positive prediction, as well as highlight how Made in Italy's success rested on transatlantic dynamics of mutual influences.As mentioned earlier, amid Italy's economic miracle, the Italian foreign trade minister officially inaugurated an ""export drive policy"" sponsoring programs to increase the country's exports and its promotional initiatives ""preferibilmente in USA piuttosto che negli altri paesi"" (Ministero Commercio Estero 1960a; preferably in the United States rather than in other countries).14 This effort relied on a large network of public offices and private communication agencies, which were in constant relation with Italian, American, and Italian American firms. At the institutional level, the main protagonists of Italy's export drive were the government's commercial offices on the one side and the Italian chambers of commerce in the United States on the other. The former included a main commercial office at the Italian embassy in Washington, DC, and five regional offices. Of these latter, two—the one in New York City and the one in San Francisco—were directly operated by the Foreign Trade Ministry through, respectively, a commercial consul and a commercial attaché, while the other three—in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New Orleans—were controlled by the local representative offices of the Italian Foreign Institute, the ICE (the Istituto per il Commercio Estero). The task of these commercial institutions was to conduct market studies and surveys ""aiming specifically to promote Italian products at the American consumer level"" (Trade with Italy 1957a). They were also instructed to ""encourage individual initiative; handle promotional activities, give technical assistance, information and clarification on existing regulations and economic trends""; maintain constant relations with Italian firms, support the conclusion of contracts and agreements, sponsor Italy's participation in major commercial fairs and exhibitions across the United States (as with the above-mentioned Festival of Italy); keep contacts with press agencies; publish articles and advertisements dedicated to Italian products in American magazines like Harper's Bazaar, Esquire, Vogue, Life, Holiday, and Home Magazine; as well as distribute their own publications, including Italian Trade Topics and Italy Presents. Lastly, ICE offices offered their support and sponsorship (in the form of decorations, information materials, and creation of connections between importers and distributors) to the many Italian ""weeks and festivals"" or Italian tastings organized by American supermarkets and department stores in many US cities, from Dallas, St. Louis, and San Francisco to Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, and Baltimore.15As for the Italian chambers of commerce, at this stage, there were three different but related organizations: the Italian-American Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, the San Francisco Italian American Chamber of Commerce of the Pacific Coast (organized in 1956), and the New York-based American Chamber of Commerce for Trade with Italy. All of them operated in regular contact and collaboration with Italy's commercial offices in the United States. The chambers' declared objectives included checking on rate increases, implementing the Reciprocal Agreement Act, conducting lobbying efforts, favoring or opposing trade legislation on imported goods, giving advice to Italian authorities, keeping major importers and buyers of Italian products up to date, sending agents to Italy, holding seminars on trade and investment opportunities, and distributing a series of magazines such as Trade with Italy, or the United States-Italy Trade Directory. These publications contained all updated information and statistics on imports and exports, events, contacts, lists of American buyers and Italian exporters, and so forth. To pursue its goals, the New York chamber also appointed its representative in Washington, DC, and, more importantly, organized recurring wine and food tastings, cultural events, gala dinners, and film showings, at times with the involvement of famous Italian stars like Claudio Villa (Trade with Italy 1959c, 1960a, 1962a).Overall, both the Italian chambers of commerce and ICE offices operated in close contact with the main Italian corporations present in or exporting to the US market, as well as with all major US importers of Made in Italy, making it possible to track down the nature and timing of their presence and activity in the United States. In 1957, Trade with Italy listed a total of more than 850 American importers of Italian products. Most of them were Italian American firms based in the New York area or in other big urban centers like Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco, and New Orleans (unsurprisingly, the same cities hosting Italy's commercial offices and chambers of commerce). According to an ICE survey on Italian exporters, in 1961, 29,991 Italian firms were selling their goods in the US market, mostly cars, food, semifinished metallurgical products, fabrics, and textiles (Trade with Italy 1961h). In the food sector, we find many brands that are still popular today, alongside an incredible variety of local Italian products.16 In most cases, food items, wines, vermouths, and other beverages were distributed thanks to the intermediation of a series of American, or more often Italian American, importing firms, such as Schieffelin & Co. (Chianti Ruffino), S.A. Schonbrunn & Co. (coffee), Schroeder Bros. Inc. (cheeses, canned ham, tomato paste), Nino A. Sidari (Venchi, Fulvi, Auricchio), Galvanoni & Nevy Bros. (Fiuggi mineral water and Olio Sasso), A. Giurlani & Bro. (Star olive oil and tomato sauce), Ambriola Co. Inc. (pecorino and provolone cheese), or Banfi Products Corp. (Ferrero wines and vermouths). A few food corporations had instead their own local subsidiary in America. This was the case of Buitoni, which distributed its pasta and Perugina candies through Gourmet Imports (founded in 1956 and controlled by the International Buitoni Organization), but also of Fernet Branca liquors (distributed by the Fratelli Branca & Co. Inc. of New York), Cinzano spirits, Bertolli olive oil (Bertolli Trading Corporation), and Cirio, which distributed its canned food products through a subsidiary firm based in New York.As for the mechanical and machines sector, most Italian firms generally relied on hundreds of local agents spread all around the country. By the end of the 1950s, companies like Fiat or Lambretta were distributing their cars and motorcycles through more than four hundred American dealers. Some major Italian firms also had US branches, like Piaggio's Vespa Distributing Corp. of New York, Lambretta's Innocenti Corp., Necchi Sewing Machines Sales Corp., Fiat S.p.A., and Olivetti Corporation of America. Moreover, to extend their market beyond the East Coast, all of these firms established contracts with local distributors and licensed manufacturers.17 Other large corporations like SNIA Viscosa and Montecatini similarly opened their subsidiaries or plants in the United States, while also appointing local distributors.The reliance on American importers and sales agents was particularly predominant in the fashion sector, where the role of American buyers and department stores proved fundamental to guaranteeing the growing popularity of Italian models and designers. In this sense, the postwar success of Italian fashion in the US depended as much on the initiative of figures such as Giovanni Giorgini and the creativeness of designers like Simonetta, Laura Aponte, or Emilio Pucci as on the intuition and promotion of a few department stores like Neiman Marcus in Dallas, I. Magnin in San Francisco, or Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Bloomingdales in New York.18 All of these sent their buyers and agents to Italy during major fashion and fabric showings and signed contracts to acquire Italian models and designs for their own tailoring.19 In some cases, these stores organized weeks-long Italian festivals to promote their acquired Italian collection in a mutually beneficial collaboration with local ICE offices, which defined such events as the perfect combination ""tra il nostro interesse di avvalerci della larga pedana pubblicitaria offertaci da un'organizzazione come I. MAGNIN e l'interesse dello stesso I. MAGNIN di avvalersi dell'attrattiva e della popolarità del tema del disegno italiano per stimolare maggiore interesse e affluenza di pubblico nei suoi grandi magazzini"" (Ministero Commercio Estero 1959b; between our interest in exploiting the large advertising platform offered to us by an organization such as I. MAGNIN, and the interest of I. MAGNIN itself in exploiting the attractiveness and popularity of Italian design to increase interest and visits to its department stores).The largest and most successful of these Italian fairs was organized by Neiman Marcus in Dallas in the fall of 1960; it received the financial and logistic collaboration of both private Italian enterprises and the Italian government. The festival lasted four weeks and coincided with a series of collateral events such as film showings, Italian art exhibitions, and concerts of locally famous Italian American singers. It was anticipated by the sending of fifteen American buyers to Italy to select and help develop an ad hoc collection of Italian apparel and other products. It also involved the renting of an Alitalia plane to carry Italian items and representatives including high fashion models, government officials, Italian manufacturers, and a few Italian celebrities. For the entire duration of the festival, the store proposed Italian menus and was decorated with ""Palio di Siena"" flags, reproductions of Italian fountains, a small-scale version of the Leonardo Da Vinci ocean liner, traditional Sicilian puppets, and some of the most iconic Italian cars in a mix of Italy's folklore and modernity (Ministero Commercio Estero 1960d).The great participation of Italian Americans in this festival (as in all others), alongside the fact that the majority of the importers and distributors of Italian commodities were Italian American, points to this group's consistently fundamental role as cultural and commercial mediators in Italy-US relations. Alongside more visible figures such as Macy's vice president Leo Martinuzzi (who in 1960 was awarde",2024-04-01,
"Transatlantic Modern Consumerisms: Italian Goods and Commercial Cultures in Postwar America, 1949–1972","In her welcoming remarks to the guests of the sixteenth Transatlantic Award Gala Dinner that the American Chamber of Commerce in Italy held in Rome on December 6, 2022, the Italian ambassador to the United States Mariangela Zappia emphasized the continuing significance of the Made in Italy sector for US-Italy relations: The United States appreciates more and more Made in Italy, far beyond the established and famous 3Fs of food, fashion, and furniture, showing great interest for high-quality products in the most innovative sectors, those of the economy of tomorrow. Furthermore, in the current geopolitical scenario, which makes strengthening relationships between ""trusted friends"" more important than ever . . . the potential for growth of our already extraordinary economic partnership with the United States is enormous. Italian businesses can be sure that the United States is their principal and most enthusiastic audience, as well as a still widely unexplored market where Made in Italy [producers] can find tremendous opportunities for exports and exceptionally valuable partnerships. (La Posta 2023)The vibrant declarations of the Italian ambassador came at a time when the newly elected government of Giorgia Meloni had just created a brand-new Ministry of Businesses and Made in Italy, helping bring the concept back to the center of Italian public debate. This renewed attention to Made in Italy confirms that, besides the vital importance of exports for Italy's economy, the nation has placed more trust than ever in its high-quality productions as the most valuable means of what political scientist Joseph Nye has called soft power. In a context of increasingly globalized markets and multipolar international relations, Made in Italy products and styles are just as important to Italy for cultural diplomacy as they are for its economy (Nye 1990; Iriye 1979; Ellwood 2021; Winder 2020).Zappia's words suggest important considerations about the historical role the United States has played as the primary market in the global diffusion of Made in Italy–labeled goods and narratives of style. First, Zappia asserts that the international commercial impact of Made in Italy extends beyond a few ""classic"" sectors, such as fashion, food, and design, with which it has generally been associated because those were the first to break through in the American market after World War II. The ambassador goes on to speak about Made in Italy as the main diplomatic asset to maintaining the Atlantic alliance with the United States, Italy's ""most trustworthy friend,"" in a challenging geopolitical context (the reference being to the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and the international crisis it engendered). Zappia's remarks express the recognition of the United States' essential role in providing a large market for Made in Italy products and style and in expanding the label's influence.The five contributing authors to this special issue of Italian American Review critically reconstruct the history of the early development and success of Made in Italy, establishing its origins in the US-Italy transatlantic context between 1949 and 1972. Methodologically, these articles interpret Made in Italy broadly, not only as a commercial label, consumer style, and economic resource but also as a public discourse on Italian identity and a historical-cultural construct in the making. The transatlantic development of Made in Italy, as both an immaterial value added to Italian products and an array of symbols and imaginaries about Italy and Italians, was a vital factor in the intersecting dynamics of Italian ""nation building""—the definition and promotion of an Italian national identity—and the Italian performance of what scholars ever more regularly call ""nation branding""—the strategies aimed at promoting the image of the country internationally (Aronczyk 2013; Viktorin et al. 2018). The US-Italy special relationship within the post–World War II framework was the critical and necessary arena for these interconnected processes to develop and thrive.This special issue contextualizes the Italy-US transatlantic transfer of goods, commodities, tastes, style, and ideas that is at the origin of Made in Italy in the specific, and probably irreplicable, geopolitical context of the Cold War, the Marshall Plan, and the international financial system based on the US dollar created with the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. The dialogue and exchange between Italy and the United States, in the context of the modernization of Italy and the ideological and political imperatives of the Cold War, had a fundamental role in determining Made in Italy's forms, developments, and success. The need to rebuild Italy after World War II, as well as to consolidate and reassure the West of Italy's allegiance to its system of transatlantic values in an international scenario of bipolar ideological conflict (especially given the presence of a strong Italian Communist Party), prompted Italian political and economic leaders to reimagine and redefine an Italian cultural identity that reunited the country domestically (nation building) and restored its image internationally (nation branding). From these domestic politics and international relations came the promotion of a new image of the nation, focused on a specifically Italian style of modernity able to keep up, and even compete, with not only the products and models of the other Western European countries but also those of the United States.1Contributors to this issue analyze the construction of a transatlantic taste for Made in Italy products, models, and lifestyles during the years of undisputed US world economic hegemony and the Italian miracle economic boom, from after World War II to around 1972. Chronologically, the analysis takes as its starting date the exhibition Twentieth-Century Italian Art, held at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City from June 28 to September 18, 1949, which signaled and celebrated the ""Renaissance"" of Italian arts and culture after the dark hiatus of Fascism and the war. As its ideal point of arrival, this special issue adopts another exhibition that MoMA devoted to Italian modern design, Italy: The New Domestic Landscape (May 26 through September 11, 1972). That exhibition opened a decade that, with the end of the worldwide system created at Bretton Woods, the decline of the global influence of the United States, and the turmoil in international economy caused by the oil crisis, ushered in the notion of ""the global"" and hence also a new phase in the history of Made in Italy.Rather than focusing on the short period typically considered the golden era of Made in Italy—the 1980s—this special issue aims at rethinking the origins of Made in Italy in a wider chronological frame and from a transdisciplinary perspective capable of capturing the many instances of transatlantic transfers that would remain hidden by a perspective that continued to privilege nationally centered or bidirectional patterns of exchange. Historicizing the emergence of Made in Italy within a broader space means rebalancing its center of gravity in the international arena itself rather than anchoring it on either side of the Atlantic. At the same time, this shift provides the methodological conditions for intercepting and detailing through specific case studies the circularity of the flows of goods, people, messages, meanings, and capitals between Italy and the United States as a fundamental factor in the creation of Made in Italy.The earliest studies of the political, economic, and cultural relations between Italy and the United States in the Cold War era centered on the Americanization of postwar Italian society, highlighting both its limits and its impact (Campus 2008; Ellwood 1985; Ellwood and Lyttleton 1985). Expanding critically on the Americanization of Europe, historians later considered the different strategies of cultural diplomacy that the United States deployed to undermine the popularity of Communist ideas and the electoral appeal of the Communist Party in Italy, which was of great concern to the US government and diplomatic officers. Studies of Hollywood films, supermarkets, and the practices, cultures, and institutions of consumption and consumerism that featured prominently in US soft-power initiatives (D'Attorre 1991; Gundle 1995; Brogi 2011; Tobia 2008; Fasce and Bini 2015) complicated an otherwise unidirectional perspective on the Americanization of Western Europe by evidencing the various forms of ""selective appropriation"" of American models in different European countries and by shedding light on reciprocal influences on both sides of the Atlantic (Kroes 1996; Pells 1997; Gardner 2020).More recently, some scholars have begun to consider not only the dominant west-to-east but also east-to-west transatlantic exchange flows. Several works have examined the growing popularity in the United States of a distinctive Italian style in fields like fashion, architecture, film, and general notions of beauty (Gundle 2007, 2020; Scrivano 2013; Bettiol 2015; Paulicelli 2017; Belfanti 2019). Historians and sociologists have studied the innovative character and the appeal in the United States of specific Italian models of industrialization. Examples of an Italian version of Fordism and post-Fordism—including Northern Italian business-products manufacturer Olivetti and Third Italy's industrial districts and small-scale, small-batch, design-intensive production—have inaugurated a more nuanced way of understanding the multiple directions of transatlantic transfer, adding players, objects, and instances of cultural mediation between Italy and the United States (Blim 1990; Putnam 1993; Cadeddu 2012).2These studies of multidirectional transnational exchange flows have broken important new ground with regard to the circulation of Italian products and paradigms in postwar American society by showing that circulation fed (and at the same time was fed by) the search for an authentically Italian style and production/consumer models on both sides of the Atlantic. They remain, however, premised in a disciplinary scholarship that this special issue challenges: they addressed Made in Italy in the United States by means of sectors, compartments, and languages (fashion, film, design, etc.) and using isolated case studies of noteworthy individuals (authors, film directors, artists, etc.). While commendable, the knowledge these studies advance represents only the starting point from which this special issue moves onward. Bringing together contributions from historians as well as scholars of fashion studies, design studies, and architecture (thereby pursuing a more comprehensive view of the systemic transfer of Made in Italy goods, styles, and discourses to the postwar United States), this special issue aims to overcome the sectoral, field-by-field, case-study approach of previous studies. Similarly, the research showcased here considers the production and consumption of Made in Italy in both the United States and Italy, challenging nation-based approaches in the existing literature that privilege either the sending or the receiving end of the exchange.The recovery of the many networks of transnational exchange—products, producers and consumers, languages, and ideas that progressively shaped Made in Italy—is central to the research project resulting in the articles collected here. Made in Italy is best understood as a discourse that contains multiple interrelated narratives and values. These include authenticity, craftsmanship, traditional knowledge, memory, integrity, seduction, taste, style, and sustainability. Accordingly, Made in Italy as a concept is endorsed, circulated, and projected by various languages and industries, be they fashion, film, food, design, or tourism, creating dense interconnections of meanings that bind them together in a usable and consumable national identity. The main argument of this special issue is that this system of materialities and meanings developed in the thick flows and webs of mutual influences produced by the shrinking of transatlantic space in the early decades of the Cold War (Nolan 2012; Berghahn 2001; Ellwood 2012). The intention is to clarify the actual distribution, appreciation, and consumption of Italian products and cultures in postwar American society. It is to show how political and economic relations between Italy and the United States not only influenced an emergent public discourse on modern Italian identity but also contributed to the expanding circulation of Italian consumer products, first across the Atlantic Ocean and then globally.The system of early transatlantic Made in Italy relied on an infrastructure of commerce made of vectors, networks, and nodes. These included airlines, airports, ships, and seaports; governmental and nongovernmental agencies; cultural and personnel exchange programs; exhibits and fashion shows; design, fashion, film, travel, and food magazines; department stores; company stores and showrooms—all of which oversaw, conveyed, and shaped the fruition of Made in Italy in the postwar United States. To make sense of such a complex infrastructure requires a multitextual as well as multidisciplinary study of the emerging public discourse on modern Italian identity, political relations, and commercial exchanges involved in the development and success of Made in Italy. By engaging such a multidisciplinary perspective, the five articles presented here track the emergence of notions of italianità as a symbolic asset for global markets in the mediation of infrastructural relations, material objects, and cultural artifacts.The special issue concludes, therefore, that—far from being a construction and a culture produced in Italy and exported abroad—Made in Italy was fundamentally influenced and shaped by the way it was received and consumed in the United States as well as by its circulation among different consumer markets and sociocultural contexts. This circulatory perspective helps overcome the classic dichotomy of Americanization versus Europeanization and suggests that much of what we nowadays perceive as distinctly ""American"" or ""Italian"" is the result of lasting processes of cultural transfer and hybridization.Furthermore, adopting a dynamic and circular perspective allows for better framing of the relationship of the original Made in Italy to the imperialist politics and nature of postwar US consumer culture. This phenomenon manifested itself in the creation of a global emporium of cultural difference from which US consumers could selectively pick national and ethnic goods, often within unequal relations of power between the United States and those nations being ""consumed.""The working hypothesis is that the United States expanded its influence on the rest of the world also through the creation of what Victoria De Grazia (2006) has called an ""informal empire/emporium"" containing diverse influences and cultural products from which American consumers could (and can) selectively appropriate ""other"" consumer goods and cultural paradigms. This recognition helps reframe the history of Western European-United States relations in the twentieth century as predominantly a history of exchanges conducted on a basis of reciprocity and mutual interest (Vaudagna 2015). In this respect, the overall conceptual frame of this special issue is indebted to the work of Kristin Hoganson (2007) on the global cultural inputs that between the nineteenth and the twentieth century contributed to shaping modern American consumer culture and domesticity. Following Hoganson, we analyze the contribution of models and products imported from Italy to the shaping of American consumer culture, everyday life, and vision of the world in the early decades of the Cold War. In mobilizing this framework, this special issue shows that Italian products, lifestyles, and cultural models not only gradually became objects of American consumption but also went as far as influencing the taste, culture, and everyday life of US society. This does not mean that the issue attributes to Made in Italy an impact on and presence in the US market quantitatively comparable to that of US products and cultural models on and in Europe; rather, it sheds light on a qualitative reality: Made in Italy was born out of and grew up in a transatlantic context, and its influence was both domestic and international—the first helping reunite, lift up, and motivate an Italy exhausted by the war, and the second nourishing and championing a US and—via that nation—global taste for Italy.The contributors to this special issue explore the politics of desire and taste for Made in Italy in different US markets and among various gendered, racialized, classed, and intersectional consumer groups. This is a dimension very rarely addressed in the existing literature.The multidisciplinary approach to studying the impact of Made in Italy in the United States is evident in not only the disparate points of view presented in the articles but also the authors' use of various sources, archives, documents, languages, and objects of study. As a collaboration involving scholars from different fields and specializations, the issue offers articles that discuss and make connections between individual producers, commodities and consumer paradigms, imaginaries and symbols, and public and private infrastructures for the commercialization of Italian products and styles. Consumer subjects, objects, and institutions ranging from US importers and distributors for Italian companies to the Italian chambers of commerce in the United States and the National Institute for International Trade; prominent figures like Gio Ponti, Giovanni Battista Giorgini, and Sophia Loren; the ships on which commodities and people traveled across the Atlantic, including the Andrea Doria and Cristoforo Colombo; exhibits dedicated to Italian design and arts; magazines, TV and live shows, and other media—all these elements contributed to the making and popularity of Made in Italy in postwar America. Even more originally, the authors in this special issue interrogate neglected aspects of Made in Italy, including the consumers and contexts of consumption in the United States. The special issue aims at providing new evidence and understanding of who the principal consumers of Italian products, styles, and models were as well as their motivations, circumstances, and environments of consumption.The articles collected here offer a picture of transatlantic modern consumerism that is much larger and more diversified in terms of players and vectors than has conventionally been understood. The role that Italian Americans—the several-million-strong community of US residents of Italian ancestry—played as coproducers, importers, marketers, and endorsers of Made in Italy remains to be fully assessed. The research work featured in this special issue addresses the instrumentality of Italian American culture in the spread of ""Italianness"" in the United States.Turn-of-the-twentieth-century Italian immigrants to the United States had already familiarized American consumers with the value of the traditional skills, sartorial expertise, craftsmanship, and taste that Made in Italy would boost after World War II: they were well-respected tailors, shoemakers, stone carvers, mosaicists, and musical-instrument makers (Ruberto and Sciorra 2021–2022; Dobney 2011). In postwar America, the renewed interest in Italy, Italian culture, and Italian products affected not only US urban culture but also the Italian American community's self-perception, self-representation, and consumer life. Italian Americans, however, also critically acted as tastemakers, mediating between Italian products, styles, and cultures traveling across the Atlantic and broader US markets. On this point, the arguments found in this special issue draw on existing studies focusing on the construction of a specific transnational Italian American identity (Cinotto 2014, 2017). These studies acknowledge the agency of Italian Americans as simultaneously producers and consumers of an Italian identity and culture in the United States. They highlight how the choice of many immigrants to consume ""Italian"" represented a means to express and claim affiliation with a common cultural belonging and, therefore, to define a precise idea of italianità (Sciorra and Ruberto 2017).This special issue relates to Italian American studies on different levels. First, it affirms that the promotion of Made in Italy in the postwar United States went hand in hand with the ""rediscovery"" of an ""authentic"" Italian identity on the part of second- and third-generation Italian Americans. The new and modern idea of Italy that Made in Italy products and styles exemplified turned out to be highly usable by those Italian Americans striving to redefine their diasporic identity as valuable, advanced, and stylish, even before the ""ethnic revival"" of the 1970s and 1980s. This cultural work of consumption turned them into ideal cultural ambassadors for Made in Italy, helping to associate it with a lifestyle that was at the same time modern and authentic, fresh and yet rooted in tradition. This collection of articles details Italian Americans' material contribution to the import, distribution, commercialization, production, and consumption of Italian products and style as well as their participation in creating an imaginary capable of fascinating and influencing US popular culture and urban society (Cinotto 2013; Diner 2003; Gennari 2017; Ruberto 2015).More broadly, this issue engages historical studies on modern Italian migrations, offering further evidence of the influence of Italian migrations on both US history and Italian history. Historian Mark Choate (2008) used the term ""migrant colonialism"" for the ways in which the mass international mobility of Italians between the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth century (and, through them, of Italian products and styles) contributed to the creation of a ""global Italy"" and global Italian diasporic identities (see also Gabaccia 2000). The collection frames the shaping of a Made in Italy discourse and style after World War II within these broader diasporic processes and flows.In the issue's first article, ""Fashion Films in the Newsreels of the Settimana INCOM, 1946–1953: Culture and Politics in the Transatlantic Context,"" Eugenia Paulicelli examines the newsreels that showcased Italian fashion in movie theaters between 1946 and 1953. The author argues that these films played a significant role in creating a discourse on a new image of Italy and Italian culture. By examining this previously unexplored material and placing it in the context of US-Italy exchanges, Paulicelli establishes a connection between Italian and Italian American designers, such as Anthony Blotta and Ferdinando Sarmi, who built their careers in the New York fashion industry. These designers frequently participated in the ""Press Weeks"" organized by Eleanor Lambert (known as the ""godmother of American fashion"") that later became New York Fashion Week. Through a detailed analysis of the catwalk, models, and cultural mediators of the Italian fashion industry abroad, Paulicelli critiques the narratives of a modern Italian identity within the political, cultural, and diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Italy during Italy's reconstruction. The article demonstrates how these exchanges had an impact on both sides of the Atlantic.In ""Consuming Italian: Transatlantic Actors and Infrastructures of Italian Exports to Postwar America, 1957–1962,"" Giulia Crisanti looks at the main networks, drivers, and consumers of Italian exports to postwar America, including governmental and nongovernmental agencies. Crisanti focuses on the period that marked Italy's economic boom and adopts a circulatory perspective. By analyzing the Italian products that entered the US market and their advertising and consumption patterns, Crisanti argues that the growing influence of Made in Italy in the United States was linked to the Americanization process happening in Italy. Thus, Italian and American dynamics intertwined, contributing to the development of Made in Italy as both a successful commercial label and a means of cultural discourse on Italian identity. This mutual exchange significantly influenced both countries.Paola Cordera, in ""From Museum to Marketplace: Displaying the Italian Lifestyle,"" takes an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of the itinerant exhibition Italy at Work: Her Renaissance in Design Today (1950–1953). The event, organized under the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) and sponsored by the Compagnia Nazionale Artigiana, provided a platform for promoting new Italian crafts and designs, from furniture to jewelry, textiles, ceramics, glass, metalwork, and small appliances. It showcased the artistic, historical, and cultural values embedded in those items. The exhibition toured several museums and department stores across the United States where newly designed products were displayed alongside contemporary artworks, merging industrial and traditional Italian craftsmanship. Cordera explores the exhibition's commercial and promotional success at marketing the Made in Italy brand along with its cultural and aesthetic values. It examines how museum display strategies influenced department stores, combining the commercial and the aesthetic to showcase Italian industrial design and decorative-arts production.Marta Averna's article ""Ambassadors of Italy: Italian Transatlantic Ocean Liners to the United States, 1946–1958"" offers a study of the ways in which national identity is conveyed through a nation's production and the environments it creates, using post–World War II Italy as a case study and focusing on transatlantic passenger ships to the United States. Averna analyzes how various decor items and materials created for a unified project—such as furnishings, works of art, and new technologies—combined with historical references to stage carefully designed arrangements that were employed in the rooms of ocean liners. Given the fact that large liners were one of the few modes of transportation across the Atlantic until 1958, these ships maintained a crucial connection between Italy and the United States.Finally, in ""Before 1951: Setting up the Network of G. B. Giorgini and the Launch of Made in Italy,"" Chiara Faggella identifies Giovanni Battista Giorgini as a crucial figure in the promotion of Italian fashion in postwar United States. Faggella situates Giorgini's professional experiences and personal relationships before 1951 to provide a more comprehensive understanding of his later accomplishments, moving beyond his role in fashion history. The article places Giorgini's business culture within a transdisciplinary framework that sheds light on the work of the intermediaries who contributed to the fame of Italian products in the United States and thereby enabled their international success.Altogether, the five articles support and confirm our initial argument that the ""invention"" of Made in Italy in the decades following World War II was an eminently US-Italy transnational process originating in the specific context of the Cold War and economic development based on mass production and consumption. From its beginnings, Made in Italy was structured in different languages and product lines and organized within a political-commercial system and a grand narrative of style, taste, desirability, and consumability. The ultimate aim of this special issue is to stimulate further multidisciplinary and collective studies on the dynamics of the production and consumption of Made in Italy in postwar America, retracing in its origins and developments a key passage in the formation of a transatlantic taste and consumer culture.Research leading to this publication has been funded by the Italian Ministry of University Research (MIUR) under the program PRIN 2017 ""Transatlantic Transfers: The Place of Italy in American Culture, 1949–1972.""",2024-04-01,
ENDOGENOUS OBSTACLES OF MARKET ECONOMY WITH MONETARY AND FISCAL MEASURES TO OVERCOME THEM,"The author's vision of endogenous obstacles to the development of the modern market economy and the ways to overcome them in the direction of macroeconomic policy on the labor-value basis of classical political economy are revealed. Three obstacles to economic growth in the course of its selfflowing (without state intervention) processes have been identified, namely: a) violation of valuemoney parity – loss of value adequacy of money; b) the lagging of solvent demand from the volume of product supply, which with a certain cyclicality blocks the reproductive process of production; c)""overproduction"" of fictitious capital, which bleeds the real sector of the economy. Regarding the support of value-monetary parity in the economy, the expediency of applying the ""monetary rule"" of monetarism has been confirmed: the emission of the money supply to the beat with the increase in real GDP. Cyclical crises of commodity overproduction are caused by the lagging of solvent demand from supply by the amount of capital accumulation, and therefore have no rational options for overcoming them, except for damping sharp changes in cyclicality. The main novelty of the author's proposals is directed against the parasitic essence of the ""financial economy"", which sprouts in the course of the ""overproduction"" of fictitious capital. Since the root cause of such a harmful phenomenon is the overprofitability of the financial sector of the economy as a result of the value-speculative revaluation of inflated assets, the essence of the author's innovation comes down to a radical reform of the tax system in order to prevent their speculative revaluation: the transition from income taxation to taxation of the market capitalization (market valuation) of large businesses based on stock price. According to the author's assumption, the tax on the market value of assets should lead to the depreciation of the inflated capitalization of financial pyramids and bubbles, that will direct investments flows to the commodity-producing sector of the economy, exempted from taxation of business profits. As a result the tax reform will deconserve the production capacities of the real economy, will lead to the industrial revival of the countries of the world democracy in the face of authoritarian revenge. Especially if these countries are consolidated on the basis of a coordinated monetary and fiscal policy: a single currency and a unified tax system. Opposing the axis of autocratic evil requires it.",2024-04-01,
Aceh as a Model of Halal Trade in Financial Goods and Services Regulation based on Pancasila within the Framework of National Law in Indonesia,"The province of Aceh holds a special autonomy status, which allows Aceh to possess the jurisdiction to enforce the Islamic law specifically in the realm of the civil law, particularly in matters related to commerce. In Aceh, trading in commodities and financial services must adhere to the principles of the Islamic law, ensuring that only halal goods are involved. Using the Content Analysis Techique, this study adopts a combined approach of the national law and the Islamic law. The data was gathered by literature and document analysis, including an examination of legal statutes, scholarly publications, and relevant books pertaining to the topic being discussed. This study asserts that the trading of halal commodities and financial services are fundamental aspects of the Islamic law, a concept that is unfamiliar in legal frameworks rooted in the Western civil law systems. Consuming food that is not halal and engaging in usury are both forbidden under the Islamic law. Within the framework of sharia, commerce is not just confined to individuals, but can also be subject to public scrutiny if they contravene fiqh, so rendering them impermissible. In order to achieve this legislative objective, the Aceh Province established a regulatory framework in the form of the Aceh Qanun, in line with the authority granted by Article 125 of Law Number 11 of 2006. This model has facilitated the emergence of a trade system that is devoid of any forbidden aspects, and financial services that are free from the practice of charging excessive interest, in accordance with Sharia principles. As a result, it differs from the conventional practices of trading goods and services that are prevalent within Indonesia. It is important to highlight that both Pancasila and National law ensure the freedom of citizens' rights to practice the Islamic law, including engaging in halal trade of commodities and financial services.",2024-03-31,
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF UKRAINE IN THE FIELD OF RAIL TRANSPORT,"The purpose of this article is to determine the competitive position of Ukraine in the field of railway transportation in comparison with Poland (a neighbouring country), Switzerland (a benchmark in the field of railway transportation) and Canada (which professes a completely different “American” principle of operating railway networks, where freight transportation is a priority). Methods. In the process of working on the article, the following research methods were used: analysis and synthesis in the selection of indicators and their grouping (production and financial, scientific and technical development, personnel characteristics) depending on the direction they characterise; methods of economic analysis – multidimensional comparative analysis, index analysis, Delphi method in determining the weight of indicators selected for analysis, rating to determine the final positions of each of the countries selected for analysis. Results. Among the main results of the study is the determination of Ukraine’s competitive position, primarily in comparison with Poland as a neighbouring country. The next most important is the group of indicators that put Ukraine behind the Swiss railways’ benchmarks, in particular, the quality of infrastructure and electrification. The scientific novelty of the results obtained is an attempt to assess the competitive positions of railway transport, which seemingly cannot compete with each other, since each of them operates in a separate territory (in most cases within the same country) and their interests hardly overlap. Currently, this is not entirely true, since, after the large-scale invasion, due to the blockade of Ukrainian seaports, a significant part of export and import commodity flows has moved to rail transport, and by analysing the situation in each individual transit country, it is possible to choose the direction that will be most acceptable for the long-distance transportation of goods to “third” countries. The practical significance of the results obtained can be viewed from at least two perspectives. The first is the indicators that have caused the Ukrainian railway to lag behind the benchmark state (Switzerland) and the work to improve the situation in each of the areas. The second side is the possibility of conducting a similar assessment of the situation in rail transport among all of Ukraine’s neighbouring countries and identifying the highest priority areas for sending most of the export and import cargo to “third” countries.",2024-03-31,
The impact of spending policy shocks on the Iraqi trade balance for the period (2004-2021),"Economic shocks directly affect financial variables in the Iraqi economy, and this is due to the presence of a strong connection between the general budget and the trade balance according to Keynesian theory. So financial policy responds through its spending and revenue tools in a way that is consistent with or contrary to the direction of the economic shock, and that response is reflected in the trade balance in a way unexpected changes can be expressed in spending policy shocks. The research aims to demonstrate the impact of spending shocks on the trade balance in the Iraqi economy. Iraqi exports depend to a large extent on crude oil exports, and they are directly affected by international oil prices. Based on the results of the cointegration test and the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for the model of spending policy and its impact on the trade balance. It was inferred that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between the variables of the model, and the stimulated response function of the model indicates that an increase in public spending leads to an increase in the trade balance deficit, and in order Achieving stability in spending activity. It is necessary to find more stable alternative sources of revenue to finance the general budget to ensure the stability of economic activity. The research recommended changing the course of public expenditures by changing the structure of the general budget in favor of investment spending directed to expanding production capacities and focal structures to ensure the availability of commodity and service products, and restructuring consumer spending to ensure rationalization and optimal allocation. In addition to the importance of reducing unproductive employment policies and other not sober spending policies..",2024-03-31,
Convex Network Flows,"We introduce a general framework for flow problems over hypergraphs. In our problem formulation, which we call the convex flow problem, we have a concave utility function for the net flow at every node and a concave utility function for each edge flow. The objective is to minimize the sum of these utilities, subject to constraints on the flows allowed at each edge, which we only assume to be a convex set. This framework not only includes many classic problems in network optimization, such as max flow, min-cost flow, and multi-commodity flows, but also generalizes these problems to allow, for example, concave edge gain functions. In addition, our framework includes applications spanning a number of fields: optimal power flow over lossy networks, routing and resource allocation in ad-hoc wireless networks, Arrow-Debreu Nash bargaining, and order routing through financial exchanges, among others. We show that the convex flow problem has a dual with a number of interesting interpretations, and that this dual decomposes over the edges of the hypergraph. Using this decomposition, we propose a fast solution algorithm that parallelizes over the edges and admits a clean problem interface. We provide an open source implementation of this algorithm in the Julia programming language, which we show is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art commercial convex solver Mosek.",2024-03-31,

INFLATION TARGETING IN INDIA: SUCCESS OR STRUGGLE? A DATA-DRIVEN ASSESSMENT,"India adopted Inflation Targeting (IT) 2016 under the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (MPFA) to maintain price stability and strengthen economic resilience. A research investigation measures IT effectiveness through a review of inflation patterns combined with volatility observations and GDP performance analysis and RBI policy reaction monitoring and exchange rate steadiness evaluation during the 2010-2024 timeframe with results from before and after IT implementation. The study obtains data from RBI and combines it with information from the Ministry of Finance, IMF, and the World Bank to evaluate the success of inflation control under IT while maintaining continuous economic development. The data shows a substantial decrease in inflation volatility because of Inflation Targeting after 2016, indicating its positive effects post-2016. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) obtained increased credibility, which prompted better-inflation expectations to take root. Even so, numerous obstacles persist. Present market conditions linked to supply-chain disruptions and worldwide commodity value changes persist in creating volatile price movements for food and fuel. Weaker GDP growth occurred due to the assertive inflation control methods, leading people to question the economic growth versus price stability balance. The IT framework has faced numerous challenges from rapid oil price increases and new external disturbances, including the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing high fiscal deficits. Implementing Inflation Targeting (IT) has encountered various obstacles despite achieving its main goals. Although inflation management under IT has gained transparency, its long-term success requires active supply-side interventions, better fiscal-monetary coordination, and the highest priority for policy flexibility. This research emphasizes how essential it is for India to update its IT framework by developing a system that combines inflation management with economic expansion while practicing inclusiveness during monetary decision-making. The investigation advances the policy discourse about IT in developing economies and recommends clear steps to enhance India's money management system. Future research needs to explore how IT affects employment statistics, income splits, and stability in financial market operations.",2024-03-30,
International Bullion Exchange at GIFT IFSC in India- A Descriptive Study,"In the global financial arena, the International Bullion Exchange (IBE) in Gujarat's GIFT (Gujarat International Finance Tec-city City represents a noteworthy advancement.

Board of directors’ social capital as factor of companies’ resilience to exogenous shocks,"Целью работы является определение влияния социального капитала членов советов директоров, формирующегося за счет различных типов связей, на устойчивость компаний к экзогенным шокам. Рассмотрены три типа связи: профессиональные, международные и политические. Используя данные крупнейших нефинансовых компаний России, включенных в индекс широкого рынка Московской биржи с 2007 по 2020 г., была проанализирована роль социального капитала в обеспечении устойчивости в периоды трех шоков: мирового финансового кризиса 2008–2009 гг., сырьевого кризиса и введения санкций в 2014–2015 гг. и кризиса, вызванного пандемией COVID-19 в 2020 г. Результаты оценивания методом наименьших квадратов моделей с фиксированными эффектами свидетельствуют о различном влиянии рассматриваемых связей в периоды кризисов на устойчивость компаний, определяемую как стандартное отклонение рентабельности активов. Результаты свидетельствуют об устойчивом негативном влиянии рассматриваемых кризисов, кроме кризиса, вызванного пандемией COVID-19. Социальный капитал членов совета директоров по-разному влиял на устойчивость компаний в периоды данных кризисов. Профессиональные связи ослабляли влияние мирового финансового кризиса. Политические и профессиональные связи усиливали негативный эффект кризиса 2014–2015 гг. Таким образом, в данном вопросе важную роль играет природа кризиса. The main goal of this paper is to determine the impact of boards of directors’ social capital on the companies’ resilience to exogenous shocks. The study explores social capital formed by various types of connections: professional, international, and political. The data of the largest non-financial companies in Russia, which shares were included in the Moscow Exchange Broad Market Index, covers the period from 2007 to 2020. It allows analyzing the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the commodity crisis and sanctions in 2014–2015, and the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The empirical results of least-squares estimation of fixed-effects models show the different influences on the companies’ resilience of the considered connections during the crises. The results show a persistent negative impact of these crises, except the one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The social capital of board members has a different influence on the companies’ resilience during these crises. Professional ties decreased the negative effect during the global financial crisis. Professional and political connections strengthened the negative impact on companies’ resilience during 2014–2015. Thus, the nature of the crisis plays an important role.",2024-03-28,
"The Times of Infrastructure Fundamentalism: Future Profits, Slow Operations, Long-Term Impacts","The 2008 Global Financial Crisis precipitated the emergence of a consensus among policymakers surrounding the state's role in spatial planning and infrastructure-led development. This chapter argues that the belief that infrastructure was the missing ingredient in earlier rounds of neoliberal restructuring constitutes an emerging 'infrastructure fundamentalism'. This animates national development plans whose time horizons now routinely extend two or three decades into the future. This new infrastructure time has inhibited the efforts of international financial institutions (IFIs) to foster 'blended finance' because planning with such extended time horizons is inherently risky. The chapter demonstrate how IFIs have sought to standardize the distribution of economic, political, and environmental risk in an attempt to future-proof profits. Its analysis confirms that while significant risks remain unaccounted for, slow operations have been launched worldwide to extend commodity frontiers and integrate markets.",2024-03-28,
Risks of international settlements of Russian organizations in the context of fragmentation of the international financial and economic space and ways to overcome them,"Subject. The article addresses the issue of building a new model of international trade and international settlements, enabling to overcome risks and minimize imbalances in relations with the rest of the world. Objectives. The study aims to identify and assess the main risks of the current model of world economic relations of the Russian Federation, including the structure of international trade, the model of international settlements and the state of the domestic currency market. Methods. I employ general scientific methods. Results. Analysis of commodity and geographical composition of foreign trade helps conclude about significant risks of the formed model. They include low diversification of exports, dependence of the economy on foreign supplies of goods of high redistribution, and concentration of foreign trade activities in unfriendly jurisdictions. The risk picture is supplemented by the high share of currencies of unfriendly countries in settlements for the supply of export and import goods. The realization of these risks under the fragmentation of the international financial and economic space leads to partial isolation of the domestic currency market from the international segment, disorganization of the system of international settlements between Russian counterparties and foreign partners.

The risks of international settlements can be partially mitigated by the gradual equalization of bilateral trade balances of the Russian Federation with the main trading partners, the transition to mutual settlements in national currencies and the use of clearing schemes.",2024-03-28,

"Four antenatal care visits by four months of pregnancy and four vital tests for pregnant mothers: impact of a community-facility health systems strengthening intervention in Migori County, Kenya","Abstract Background Early attendance at antenatal care (ANC), coupled with good-quality care, is essential for improving maternal and child health outcomes. However, achieving these outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa remains a challenge. This study examines the effects of a community-facility health system strengthening model (known as 4byFour) on early ANC attendance, testing for four conditions by four months of pregnancy, and four ANC clinic visits in Migori county, western Kenya. Methods We conducted a mixed methods quasi-experimental study with a before-after interventional design to assess the impact of the 4byFour model on ANC attendance. Data were collected between August 2019 and December 2020 from two ANC hospitals. Using quantitative data obtained from facility ANC registers, we analysed 707 baseline and 894 endline unique ANC numbers (attendances) based on negative binomial regression. Logistic regression models were used to determine the impact of patient factors on outcomes with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio testing used to compare models. Regular facility stock checks were undertaken at the study sites to assess the availability of ANC profile tests. Analysis of the quantitative data was conducted in R v4.1.1 software. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 37 purposively sampled participants, including pregnant mothers, community health volunteers, facility staff, and senior county health officials to explore outcomes of the intervention. The interview data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded; and thematic analysis was conducted in NVivo. Results There was a significant 26% increase in overall ANC uptake in both facilities following the intervention. Early ANC attendance improved for all age groups, including adolescents, from 22% (baseline) to 33% (endline, p = 0.002). Logistic regression models predicting early booking were a better fit to data when patient factors were included (age, parity, and distance to clinic, p = 0.004 on likelihood ratio testing), suggesting that patient factors were associated with early booking.The proportion of women receiving all four tests by four months increased to 3% (27/894), with haemoglobin and malaria testing rates rising to 8% and 4%, respectively. Despite statistical significance ( p &lt; 0.001), the rates of testing remained low. Testing uptake in ANC was hampered by frequent shortage of profile commodities not covered by buffer stock and low ANC attendance during the first trimester. Qualitative data highlighted how community health volunteer-enhanced health education improved understanding and motivated early ANC-seeking. Community pregnancy testing facilitated early detection and referral, particularly for adolescent mothers. Challenges to optimal ANC attendance included insufficient knowledge about the ideal timing for ANC initiation, financial constraints, and long distances to facilities. Conclusion The 4byFour model of community-facility health system strengthening has the potential to improve early uptake of ANC and testing in pregnancy. Sustained improvement in ANC attendance requires concerted efforts to improve care quality, consistent availability of ANC commodities, understand motivating factors, and addressing barriers to ANC. Research involving randomised control trials is needed to strengthen the evidence on the model’s effectiveness and inform potential scale up.",2024-03-27,
What drives currency connectedness? Evidence from the BRICS currencies,"With the rapid growth of the BRICS countries, their currencies have attracted wide attention. This study examines the dynamic connectedness of BRICS currencies and identifies the drivers of currency connectedness using a time-varying vector autoregressive (VAR) approach and a modified dynamic model averaging method. Our results indicate that dramatic changes in the currencies' total and net connectedness are related to influential economic, financial, and political events. ZAR is a consistent net transmitter, INR and CNY are consistent net recipients, whereas BRL and RUB switched roles frequently. The risk and uncertainty indices, especially the VIX and SKEW, were the most pronounced drivers affecting the total and net connectedness among the selected drivers. The remaining factors (i.e. commodity prices, asset markets, and leading global currencies) generally had limited effects but played important roles in certain influential events.",2024-03-27,
Derivative Financial Instruments (Derivatives) in Hedging Practices of Non-Financial Organizations,"The financial and economic situation in Russia in 2022 has sharply reduced the market for derivative financial instruments (derivatives), including the instruments applied by non-financial organizations (hedgers) to reduce commercial risks (hedging). At the same time, volatility in commodity markets and unilateral restrictive measures increase the risks of unforeseen property losses in connection with the execution of derivatives, which is why Russian non-financial organizations are increasingly trying to invalidate such contracts. However, a commonly used ground for contesting in many cases (violation of the requirements of a law or other legal act (Article 168 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation)) turns out to be irrelevant, indicating a distorted understanding of the legal nature of derivative financial instruments and contradictory behavior of plaintiffshedgers. Their typical arguments are explained through the legal features of derivatives: the aleatory nature on which the distribution of monetary obligations of the parties and the uncertainty of the amount of monetary provision are based, and the lack of legal prerequisites for the universal presumption of asymmetry of the parties of the hedging derivative. The legal significance of volatility in the contractual structure of a derivative financial instrument is justified by the strict relationship between its regulatory aleatory nature and the random variability of the parameters of the underlying asset, the econometric characteristics of which do not affect the validity and effect of the contract. The author draws conclusions that unlimited property losses on a derivative are preconditioned not only by its aleatory nature, but also by the hedging objectives. It is noted that unconditional application of the concept of strengths and weaknesses in derivative financial instruments involving non-financial organizations is controversial due to various aspects of contractual and information asymmetry.",2024-03-27,
Price effects of commodity financialization: Review of the evidence,"Abstract Following the 2007/2008 financial crisis, the price effects of commodity financialization have become an important research topic. We review the empirical evidence, focusing on statistical approaches and econometric models, and find that (1) Granger‐causality tests are unable to establish a relationship between commodity futures prices and funds of financial investors, implying a lack of evidence that financialization influences commodity futures prices and (2) studies that use correlation and price spread analysis mostly report evidence of a significant price effect of financialization. Thus, the statistical and econometric approaches adopted by the various studies influence the empirical findings. In addition, data identification may have an impact since economic models and statistical techniques can be sensitive to slight differences in the dataset. Our study of the literature shows that the definition of financialization is open‐ended and ambiguous. A theoretical literature review on financialization could be the logical next step.",2024-03-27,
Research on finance Credit Risk Quantification Model Based on Machine Learning Algorithm,"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that enables systems to learn and make predictions and decisions without the need for explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms learn patterns and relationships from data and are able to gradually improve their accuracy.This paper mainly introduces the application of deep learning in financial academia and the financial industry, with a particular focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning in financial quantitative trading. The paper mentions the complexity and challenges of financial markets and the difficulties machine learning faces in processing financial time series data, such as overfitting, non-stationarity, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. To overcome these challenges, the paper explores machine learning model design in financial quantitative trading and risk prediction, including data transformation and model construction. In the related work part, it introduces the history and development of quantitative investment, as well as the application of quantitative investment, such as high-frequency trading, arbitrage strategy and commodity trading advisory strategy. It then focuses on the application of machine learning in financial quantification, including the use of supervised and unsupervised learning in stock price forecasting and trading strategy generation. The paper also compares traditional quantitative strategies with machine learning strategies and discusses the advantages of machine learning in solving high-dimensional and non-linear problems. The methodology section introduces the application of the random forest model in financial quantification, including the model principle, feature importance calculation and experimental design. Through the pre-processing, feature selection and model construction of the credit risk prediction dataset, the construction and evaluation process of the random forest model is demonstrated. Finally, the performance of the random forest model is evaluated and compared with other models to demonstrate its advantages and applicability in financial quantification.",2024-03-26,
Inserção e instabilidade do capital internacional no setor sucroenergético brasileiro: uso corporativo e estratégias territoriais do Grupo BP Bunge Bioenergia,"Driven by a financialized accumulation regime, Brazil experienced, at the turn of the 21st century, several economic, social and, therefore, territorial transformations, implying important changes in agricultural spaces.With the globalization of the economy, profound transformations arise in the production process associated with agriculture, restructuring the space due to the insertion of technique, science and information.It is from this recent context of agribusiness that we intend, in this doctoral thesis, to understand some specific dynamics of the sugar-energy sector (production of sugar cane and derivatives) in the country, specifically evaluating the dynamics that comprise the corporate use of the territory by the BP Bunge Bioenergy Group.In the current century, there has been a significant expansion of sugarcane cultivation in the country, mainly due to the increase in international demands for sugar and the possibilities of affirming ethanol as a new commodity, as a result of the concerns of different countries with global warming, in addition to the emergence of flex fuel technology.Such growth, however, has encountered certain limits since 2015, following the developments of the international financial crisis.It is in this context of crisis, stagnation and slow recovery of the sugar-energy sector that our central research concern emerges.The joint venture established by BP and Bunge, for the creation of BP Bunge Bioenergy, results in a probable strategy for the aforementioned groups to remain in the activities of the sugar-energy sector in an adverse situation, a way of survival in a scenario of stagnation that has prevailed in Brazil since mid-2010s, a situation that led the group to invest in even more intensive land use strategies, with extreme technical rationalization of production and flexible work.Aiming to face the adverse situation in which the sector finds itself, the BP Bunge Group adopts practices of extreme technical rationalization of production, the most significant aspect of which can be recognized in the speed with which the digitalization of production proceeds, as well as the practices of making work more flexibilization, and even its precariousness.These conditions appear necessary to avoid the devaluation of the capital mobilized by the two multinationals in the Brazilian sugar-energy sector.",2024-03-26,
"MARKETING CHAIN ANALYSIS OF ORCHID PLANT (Case Study at the Bratang Flower Market, Gubeng District, Surabaya)","Background One of the easiest and most fertile types of beautiful flowering ornamental plants in Indonesia is the orchid. The business of orchids as a commercial flower that has high economic value has been going on for a long time, and has even become one of the important commodities in the world floricultural trade. The orchid business is currently quite developed, so that it will be able to increase farmers' income, meet the demands of environmental beauty, make residential, hotel and office complexes more beautiful. The aim is to determine the marketing chain of Orchids in the Bratang Flower Market, Gubeng District, Surabaya. Research Methods The type of research used in this research is the case study method, by taking the case of an orchid plant seller at the Bratang Flower Market, Gubeng District, Surabaya. Respondents as a whole are as many as 16 people. The analysis used in this research is descriptive qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. Results The product flow pattern of the orchid marketing chain in the Bratang Flower Market, Gubeng District, Surabaya, has one channel that distributes products in the form of orchids, namely farmers selling orchids to collectors, then collecting traders selling to retailers and retailers then selling to consumers, financial flows flow from consumers To the retailer, the retailer flows to the collector, then the collector to the farmer and the flow of information that flows from the orchid farmer to the collector, the collector to the retailer and the retailer flows to the final consumer. This occurs in two interrelated directions. The distribution margin is IDR 0.19/Pot, the total marketing margin is IDR 5000/Pot. Orchid marketing efficiency at the Bratang Flower Market, Gubeng District, Surabaya, which is equal to 1.06%, it can be said that marketing of orchids in the research area has been efficient. The conclusion is that the distribution margin is IDR 5000/pot, the total margin is IDR 5000/pot.

The impact of the Russo-Ukraine conflicts on price discovery on the financial markets,"This paper investigates the response of financial markets to two significant events within the Russo-Ukraine conflicts: the November 2013 Euromaidan protest and the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Employing diverse methods, including event studies, price discovery models, and time-varying parameter regression, we analyse abnormal returns, price discovery, time-varying herding behaviour, and market dynamics across various financial instruments, such as stock indices, currencies, and commodities. Overall, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had a more pronounced impact on financial markets compared to the Euromaidan protest. Moreover, during both events, the US dollar and yen consistently functioned as safe-haven assets. The findings also reveal variations in the responses of different assets to the conflicts, indicating potential effects on market efficiency, investor perceptions, and expectations.",2024-03-24,

Sentiment and energy price volatility: A nonlinear high frequency analysis,"This study investigates the volatility dynamics of oil and gas prices in an environment characterized by post-coronavirus disease 2019 recovery, uncertainty, high inflation, and geopolitical tensions. Unlike previous studies, we examine a long-run series of high-frequency data on gas and oil prices from July 2007 to May 2022, which provides more than one million observations with which to analyze volatility. We compute realized volatility (RV) and decompose it into continuous volatility and jumps. We then investigate the relationship between uncertainty, investor sentiment, and RV, as well as its main components. Econometrically, we extend the heterogeneous autoregressive model of Corsi (2009) while considering not only disaggregate proxies for volatility (jumps and continuous volatility) and introducing uncertainty and heterogeneous investor sentiment, but also by allowing the model to include asymmetry, nonlinearity, and time variation according to the regime under consideration. Our results present three main findings. First, we find significant evidence of volatility decomposition, suggesting that both markets are characterized by significant jumps. Second, we show that trading volume, extra-financial news (uncertainty, investor sentiment), and jumps appear to drive commodity price volatility. Third, we find evidence of nonlinearity and threshold effects on energy price volatility. These findings are relevant for policymakers, regulators, investors, and portfolio managers, as they enable them to better characterize and forecast changes in commodity prices.",2024-03-22,
Guest Editorial: The social life of Chinese infrastructures in Southeast Asia,"As part of the broader China Made project, the papers in this special section aim to provide grounded, fine-grained analyses of the environmental, social, cultural, political, and economic effects of China's infrastructure development initiatives in Southeast Asia.1 They were originally presented at the Third China Made Workshop in May of 2021, held online at the Asia Research Institute (ARI) at the National University of Singapore (see Byler & Oakes, 2021 for a summary). The papers in this special section explore the social lives of Chinese infrastructures with case studies from Vietnam (Turner et al., 2023), Cambodia (Green & Yi, 2023) and Laos (Harlan & Lu, 2024). In doing so, they investigate the ways that global China is a powerful shaper of landscapes and societies in Southeast Asia, as well as the multiple contingencies and agencies that condition, limit, and push back against China's infrastructural power. As we write now in 2024, China's development activities and investments beyond its borders have garnered a tremendous amount of attention from scholars, policymakers, politicians, and the general public alike. Much of that attention has focused on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as the primary policy vehicle for these activities and investments (see Lin et al., 2019 and Lin et al., 2021 for critical and theoretical engagements with BRI-related scholarship). The China Made project emerged in this context with the goal of exploring China's infrastructure-led development practices less from a policy perspective, or even from the view of geopolitics, and more from a fine-grained and grounded analysis of the projects themselves. We thus sought to bring a contextual and place-based perspective to our understanding of China as an emerging actor on the global development scene. We felt that such an approach depended upon an historical understanding of the role that infrastructure development has played in Chinese statecraft and in China's domestic political economy over the past several decades (Rippa & Oakes, 2023). Conceptually, we hoped such an approach would open up a space for a productive transdisciplinary conversation between the China studies and infrastructure studies fields (see e.g. Oakes, 2019; Oakes, 2021). This conversation has emphasized not simply the ways the Chinese state deploys infrastructure development as a form of power and state-making, but also the ways infrastructures themselves, as socio-technical assemblages, have agentive powers and material logics that shape environmental, social, cultural, and political life in significant ways, both within and beyond China's borders. The 2021 workshop at ARI focused on these environmental, social, cultural, and political dimensions of Chinese infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia, a region often regarded as the first segment and most important part of China's Belt and Road (Gong, 2019; Emmerson, 2020; Hiebert, 2020). Collectively, Southeast Asia is China's largest trading partner, and vice versa. But the BRI has dominated much of the analysis of China's diverse activities in Southeast Asia. In response, there has been a recognized need for ways of understanding 'how China's impacts on Southeast Asia can be better understood beyond only focusing on China-centred framings such as the BRI' (Lin & Yang, 2022: 228; see also Rowedder et al., 2023). We proceeded from the premise that Chinese infrastructure development in the region is shaped by more than China's longstanding geopolitical ambitions, desires for market expansion, and the need for a spatial fix for Chinese surplus capital. We focused particular attention on the ways that infrastructures, with their material dispositions, are capable of producing their own developmental logics, propulsions, and powers over life. While the workshop explored these issues through a broad variety of cases and analytics, the papers collected here explore the social lives of Chinese infrastructure in three broad themes: global China as a field of power; the technopolitics of infrastructure; and the spatial and temporal dimensions of infrastructure development. In this brief editorial, we explore each of these themes in general terms and comment on how they are reflected and engaged in the papers collected here. We will also provide some concluding thoughts on the role of infrastructure studies in the rapidly growing field of global China studies. A field of power is defined by attempts to influence or capture social institutions such as banking systems and energy sectors, foster patron-client relations, and, as in the focus of this section, building infrastructural power or influence by connecting and channeling communications, electricity, movement of all kinds, and other basic materials of social life. While infrastructural power thus refers to the ways infrastructural configurations shape social life, it is also a relational form of power that often exceeds the abilities of social or state actors to control and determine its effects and outcomes. This does not diminish, however, the ways states like China have effectively wielded infrastructure investment and construction to enhance their influence over society and extend their authority, even beyond their territorial borders. In approaching global China as a field of power, we follow a line of thinking, laid out initially by Ching Kwan Lee (2018; 2022a), that seeks to move beyond treating global China as an empirical object comprised of strategies, policies and projects. Instead, we treat global China as an analytical concept, a way of understanding how (and how effectively) the Chinese state wields power. Chinese power abroad is of course multifaceted and cannot be restricted to state practices. The entrepreneurial activities throughout the world of small-scale traders, shopkeepers, and manufacturers has in fact been the dominant form of Chinese influence for centuries, especially in Southeast Asia, where many generations of China's diaspora have long shaped commercial development and social change in the region (Kian, 2015; Nyiri & Tan, 2017). Much of this 'transnationalism from below' (Dittgen, 2017) exists at the edges of the formal economy and has long blurred the line between licit and illicit activity (Rippa, 2020). But Chinese influence is felt not just through economic channels (see e.g. Ling & Segre-Reinach, 2021). While we recognize this diversity of influence, we focus our discussion on the state and larger transnational corporations because of their outsized role in infrastructure development in Southeast Asia. Lee proposed three domains of practice, or modes of power, that tend to characterize China's efforts to exert influence through its global investments and development projects, most of which have involved infrastructural construction of various sorts. These are economic statecraft, patron clientelism, and symbolic domination. The first of these—economic statecraft—involves the use of economic means to achieve political and/or diplomatic objectives which might include, for example, recognition of China's territorial claims. State-owned enterprises figure prominently here, though private firms can also play a fundamental role in China's economic statecraft, as do financial institutions. Indeed, perhaps the bluntest form of economic statecraft that captures considerable attention is the use of state-backed development financing to secure influence (the so-called 'debt trap' strategy). While some scholars have argued that much of the debt-trap discourse is driven by racialized fear of the West being displaced as the world's dominant development power and neglects the role played by states that seek Chinese-financed projects or fails to carefully examine the specific motivations of Chinese companies and agencies (Carmody, 2020; The Atlantic, 2021), it cannot be denied that debt financing remains a powerful tool of economic statecraft for China (see also Lai et al., 2020). Patron clientelism has been a basic practice of Chinese statecraft since at least the founding of the PRC (Walder, 1986; Oi, 1989) and probably well before that too. There are echoes of it in the so-called tributary system which, as Lin (2009) has argued, continued as an instrument of political expediency even after the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1911. It was also a long-standing political practice along China's internal southwestern frontier, where the tusi system of cultivating native chieftainship was adopted as an indirect form of rule for centuries (Herman, 1997; Crossley, et al., 2006). In more contemporary practice, patron clientelism involves cultivating uneven interpersonal relationships with key actors in places hosting (or potentially hosting) Chinese development projects. These relationships are meant to deliver material benefits (from China) in exchange for political allegiance (from hosts). They also often have the effect of bolstering the power of local officials. Of course, such relationships are not unique to China, but have perhaps played a comparatively large role in the extension of Chinese state power. Finally, symbolic domination might be considered as the exercise of influence by shaping people's common sense, disposition, and habits of thought. While we might often think of this as 'soft power', it is important to link efforts to influence and control the discourse about China as part of the state's efforts to dominate that discourse within China, rather than simply regarding it as a tool of foreign policy or external influence, as implied by the idea of soft power (Repnikova, 2022). Spectacular infrastructure projects, new town developments, and other large-scale developments financed and built by China throughout the Global South play an outsize role in constituting the symbolic dimensions of state power. Infrastructure is, indeed, central to all of these modes of power. It is the most common 'material benefit' deployed by China in exchange for political objectives, and through which patron client relationships are cultivated. The example of technological standards provides just one illustration of this. China's ability to shape international technical standardization in a global arena of power competition has become significant. Rühlig (2022) argues that it not only helps Chinese companies but also the state more broadly, by creating lock-in effects in which host countries must rely on Chinese suppliers to maintain and further build-out their railway networks. This may be the case, for instance, in Indonesia as a result of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail, in Laos, and in Ethiopia. In addition, China's projects are often regarded as symbolic markers of status and modernity in recipient countries, helping to forge popular associations of China with progress, development, and hopeful futures. As observed by Turner and her colleagues (Turner et al., 2023), China is clearly viewed as a viable avenue toward 'modernity' for many Southeast Asian countries, even if it remains dogged by a popular perception in some places of mass-producing cheap and poor-quality goods. Infrastructural power, however, has multiple forms that in some ways extend beyond ideas of national development. To understand this excess, we also treat infrastructural power as a relational form of power that does not emerge simply from 'the state' in a unidirectional way. In this, we note the way infrastructural power might be understood as a materialist reframing of what Foucault called 'biopower', in which power is emergent within and among the relations between the myriad organizations, institutions, technologies, and other apparatus that regulate and control or discipline bodies and populations. Thus, infrastructural power entails not simply state policies and strategies but a diverse collection of organizations, firms, regulatory bodies, expert systems, financial institutions, and standards. To these we could also add the materials of these infrastructures themselves: concrete, steel, wire, and even immaterial components, such as wireless signals. The 'socio-technical assemblages' that constitute infrastructural forms (Anand et al., 2018) can be understood as having the power to shape outcomes in ways that might vary from the straightforward political objectives of policy actors. Approaching global China as a field of power has bearing on a key question that animates much of the discussion in the papers collected here: to what extent can a distinct 'China model' of development be identified when considering the on-the-ground characteristics of China's infrastructure development projects in Southeast Asia? This question comes up for a number of reasons. China has at different times both eschewed and promoted the idea of a distinct China model. Although Deng Xiaoping famously admonished other countries to not follow China's model (as part of the Chinese state's efforts to promote self-determination and solidarity among Third World nations), a stance that has been repeated by Chinese leaders over the years, including Xi Jinping, there are clearly aspects of China's state-led development and modernization experience that it uses to support all three modes of power that it exerts abroad. China has grown increasingly confident in articulating a counter-vision of a poly-centric global order not dominated by the West or by the unfettered neoliberalism of global capitalism. While this vision is in some ways offered, and interpreted, as a model, the view from the ground reveals a more pragmatic approach that is seldom ideologically driven (Tang, 2020). China's approach, in short, is always embedded and localized in host countries. Tritto and Camba (2022) point out that the 'Shekou model'—named after one of the first industrial parks established in the 1980s in the Pearl River Delta—has shaped the way industrial parks in Southeast Asia have been built (with a dedicated port, residential compounds, seclusion and separated services for employees). But these parks are also highly localized by host country development priorities and by the politics that such parks generate. What China does on the ground is thus always shaped by the conditions and situations in target countries. This does not need to be understood purely as a limitation on Chinese power, however. Nor is it that outcomes not matching the 'model' are necessarily indicators of the power of the countries and communities that host Chinese projects. Agency does not always translate into benefit. As Lesutis (2021) has pointed out in analysing Chinese railway construction projects in Kenya, host state visions of enhancing territorial power via mega-project infrastructure construction are diverted by the power of Chinese companies' interference with local development objectives. But Chinese companies do not always get their way either, as made clear for instance in Dourado's (2023) critique of China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group's failed efforts to bypass local environmental regulations and other standards in its efforts to build the Brazil-Peru transcontinental railway. Harlan and Lu (2024) address the question of whether or how China exports its development model. They argue that what they call a 'cooperation-infrastructure nexus' establishes implicit narratives of a China model. This discursive model has material effects, but the outcome is always very different from what happened in China. Yet even discursively, the 'China model' remains vague for the same on-going reasons that led to Deng Xiaoping disclaiming any specific model that China sought to impose on other countries (thus, paradoxically, making it an attractive alternative 'model' compared to the West). In the specific cooperation programs they analyse in their paper, there are a variety of priorities and goals being pursued by a variety of actors. But there are some common attributes: self-reliance, governance capacity, technology innovation, and an infrastructural focus. This is similar to what has been argued by Lampton et al. (2020: 236) in their account of Chinese railway construction in Southeast Asia. They note that while there may not be a 'China model' there does seem to be a 'China approach' 'that marries strategic direction, relentless entrepreneurialism and opportunism, a willingness to work with nations as Beijing finds them (not as it wishes them), and a capacity to focus resources'. The case-study specific focus of Harlan and Lu's research demonstrates why a grounded and place-based analysis is crucial for understanding how and to what extent Chinese projects in other countries reflect China's efforts to generate an alternative to Western development, based on its own development experience as a 'model'. At the same time, these projects also demonstrate how China's seemingly ambivalent efforts to promote such an alternative model are nevertheless constrained by the practicalities of local political economies. This is not to say that 'locals' always want to do things their own way when dealing with China. Many in Laos look to China as a more appropriate development model, one worthy of emulation. But translation is complicated by transactional realities and agendas of the firms involved, by the technological necessities of the projects themselves, and by the path dependencies laid down by established patterns of governance. As Harlan and Lu point out, 'the technologies, standards, and practices of the ""China model"" advanced through cooperation are rarely implemented on the ground'. As Green and Yi (2023) argue in their paper, 'local conditions' does not quite capture the complex geographies and histories within which Chinese development actors operate. These need to be analysed, they point out, at multiple scales (not just locally) and through various networks. Chinese development finance flows into an inherited geographical space shaped by previous relations between China and Cambodia. At the same time, this flow is characterized by much more than a bilateral debt relationship. As they have intensified commodity rice production, Cambodian farmers have become enmeshed in a range of transnational commodity markets that shape the outcomes of China's capital investments. Green and Yi argue that paying attention to multi-scalar networks of actors, circuits of capital and struggles over water that produce irrigated landscapes, yields an analysis of global China that goes far beyond simplistic tropes of 'debt traps' and 'spatial fixes' for surplus capital accumulation. Is global China just the latest variation on the imperial logics of global capitalism? This claim is implied in the totalizing approach laid out by Hardt and Negri (2001), and it is also suggested by Gordillo's (2019) notion of the 'metropolis'. For Gordillo, China cannot be understood as existing 'outside' the vast constellation of nodes and conduits repetitively moving objects, bodies, energy, and information across national borders and continents. The idea of 'the metropolis' as the expression of capitalism's infrastructure power raises the question of the extent to which global China, as a field of power, is constrained (or even dominated) by the logics (and logistics) of global capital. In the brief discussion thus far, we have emphasized the centrality of the Chinese state, and we have deliberately evaded a broader discussion regarding the state-capital relationship in China (see Peck, 2021) along with other debates over the totalizing nature of global capitalism, 'varieties of capitalism', state capitalism, and Party-state capitalism (see e.g. Brenner et al., 2003, Pearson et al., 2022). In this context we are persuaded by Lee's (2018) argument that global China is driven by a different kind of capital that is focused less on immediate return on investment and more on the optimization of profit for a variety of objectives. This approach identifies a form of Chinese state capital that is both centrally controlled and subject to local conditions. Indeed, Lee argues that Chinese state capital is conditioned by local events and countermovements in different ways when compared with the private capital that dominates neoliberal globalization. 'As Chinese state capital was driven by state-defined objectives inclusive of, but irreducible to, profits, it was more ""sticky"" and place-bound than global private capital' (Lee, 2018: 155). While these papers do not weigh-in explicitly on the big questions of global capitalism and how it relates to the Chinese state and to global China, they offer ways of appreciating how Chinese companies and agencies both seek to establish their own standards and frameworks for reconfiguring the global investment and development environment, while at the same time revealing the constraints and limitations that they consistently face in these efforts. Those constraints and limitations demonstrate the reality of a global capitalism that Chinese actors must engage with rather than compete against. Yet as Green and Yi argue, reducing China's development practices to a function of the logics (and crises) of capital accumulation (i.e. the 'spatial fix' argument) is to miss most of what is driving and shaping global China. Technopolitics have been variously defined as technical projects developed with political objectives in mind (Mitchell, 2002), the ways technological systems serve as proxies for hidden political agendas (Joyce, 2003), or the political effects of socio-technical configurations of various smaller technologies such as service meter systems (Von Schnitzler, 2016). Brian Larkin has argued, in keeping with this latter framing of technopolitics, 'that infrastructures typically begin as a series of small, independent technologies with widely varying technical standards' (Larkin, 2013: 330). These smaller technologies become infrastructures 'when either one technological system comes to dominate over others or when independent systems converge into a network'. As these material and immaterial techniques and technologies are brought into connection, they enter into a dynamic relationship with political rationalities. In Larkin's conceptualization, this is important in at least two ways. First, it brings citizens and spaces into connection via technological systems that are often far removed from formal political institutions (Larkin, 2013: 328). Second, infrastructures of interlinked systems produce particular structures or atmospheres of feeling that feeds into political movements and sensibilities. All of these approaches are relevant to analysing the political effects of China's infrastructure projects. For us, a technopolitical approach is one attuned to finding the political in unexpected places, and one that works against 'the tendency to understand politics too readily in geopolitical and economic terms, overdetermining the significance of specific controversies and events' (Barry, 2013: 185). Rather than approaching the politics of China's projects in Southeast Asia as a deliberate form of economic statecraft or a kind of 'infrastructure diplomacy' (both of which are of course useful analytical frames for getting at a more overt form of politics), a more grounded and place-based approach tends to reveal the ways political effects emerge in highly specific ways that have much to do with the social relations that swirl around technical configurations. Technopolitics is, in other words, a way of analysing how infrastructure projects can generate local political effects that both constrain and enable their development. And in some cases these political effects go well beyond 'the local'. In Harlan and Lu's paper, the rhetoric of 'South-South cooperation' provides a discursive framework for China's investment projects in Laos. China's leadership views connectivity in broad terms, not just the 'hard' infrastructural kind, but also 'soft' connectivity, people-to-people connectivity and mediated events. As already noted, soft connectivity—exemplified by training programs in best practices and cooperative exchanges that represent patrons and clients on equal footing—is where much of the work articulating an alternative 'China model' gets done. These soft infrastructures have their own material effects by, for example, introducing new technologies and systems, and practices for maintaining them over a long duration, that can be transferred from China. But the effects of the projects themselves end up being highly variable and fail to align with the rhetorical claims of soft connectivity. For example, China promotes small hydropower (SHP) as an appropriate infrastructure for South-South cooperation, but existing hydropower developments in Laos, as well as the desire for greater profitability among construction firms and Lao officials alike, has resulted instead in a trend toward larger hydropower infrastructures. For Green and Yi (2023), irrigation infrastructures comprise a technopolitical network that circulates capital throughout agrarian landscapes by reassembling relations between people and nature. This network involves much more than just irrigation infrastructures but also new roads, bridges, ports, and other components that facilitate the flow of commodity rice within and beyond Cambodia. The effect of this network is to recalibrate how farmers work the land and how they interact with the market, introducing pressures of market concentration and monopolistic tendencies such that the 'irrigated landscape has become connected to market networks shot through with power at multiple scales'. In addition, investment in irrigation infrastructures have produced unintended outcomes 'arising from technical design, water scarcity, pest ecologies, and struggles over water access'. The objective of such investments have in some ways been achieved by enabling two crops per year, turning Battambang into a commodity rice producing region and thus enhancing the production of surplus value through agricultural capitalization. But these changes in the landscape, and the socio-technical relations driving those changes, have produced their own political effects, most notably in terms of contests over access to water. Irrigation infrastructure governance has developed into a 'chronic problem' for Cambodia left over after the project is built and the Chinese company collects its pay and moves on. On a national scale, investment objectives have been met, while a more local form of politics simmers. Infrastructural configurations also drive the politics swirling around the construction of the Hanoi metro in ways that are perhaps counterintuitive. As Turner, Nguyen and Hykes argue in this special section, popular opinions about the metro have been shaped more by its actual effects rather than Vietnam's historical antagonism toward China: 'it is the on-the-ground realities of this project and the unexpected events during its construction that have turned many residents against it'. And yet, those historical antagonisms were also recalibrated by the project's technopolitics. While the metro achieved a certain symbolic value as 'modern', construction itself was dominated by delays, accidents, cost-overruns, inconveniences, and displacements. These things tend to happen in almost any megaproject, but the material process of the metro's construction enlivened a latent politics of modernization that had been simmering in the background, producing a structure of feeling in line with Larkin's framing of technopolitics. The metro was part of the government's plans for a more modern Hanoi dominated by rational planning and fewer motorbikes. China's willingness to invest in this vision and thus expose itself to the broad discontent produced by the project gave the Hanoi government something of a free pass. All the papers in this special section seek to map in various ways Chinese investment patterns across multiple networks and scales of agency, and onto landscapes of historical change that significantly impact the effects of those investments. Attention to the spatial dimensions of China's infrastructure investments in Southeast Asia is important since those investments tend to be understood simply at national and global scales of states and multinational capitalism. This is not just a question of accounting for a previously neglected 'local scale' but more importantly for the connections across multiple scales that are established by infrastructural configurations. A grounded, place-based analysis, in other words, is not restricted to the local scale by any means, but demonstrates how local effects reverberate across scales. This approach is most explicitly explored by Green and Yi, but all of the projects examined in the papers (irrigation, metro rail, rubber, hydropower) stretch across multiple scales in terms of their financing, the political and policy contexts that enable them, and the social and political effects that result. There are distinct agencies associated with different scales and networks that effect, shape, and otherwise act upon these projects. Only some of these agents can be called 'Chinese' even if China is the driver of the changes taking place. Thus, attention to spatial dimensions provides a useful analytical tool for understanding the diffused and relational qualities of China's infrastructure power and how these qualities produce effects that can vary greatly from the policies and strategies that seek to wield that power for China's benefit. At the same time, attention to temporal dimensions is equally important. The outcomes of the Chinese investments explored in these papers often reflect the path-dependencies that previous infrastructures, political organizations, and economic patterns have left. These can include older agricultural infrastructures in Cambodia, existing street layouts and transportation systems in Hanoi, or hydropower construction trends that drive development toward larger and larger projects rather than 'small hydropower' that may be more appropriate in scale and cost. There are of course many different ways of conceptualizing the temporal dimensions of infrastructure, and the field has long been engaged in how infrastructures shape notions of futurity and progress, and how different infrastructural configurations entail different temporal horizons of construction, completion, maintenance, decay, and ruination. These temporalities are conditioned not only by policy or planning decisions and other governance-related factors, but also by the properties of the materials themselves. Those properties also impact the ways infrastructures may be recycled, reused and repurposed over time. The half-life of given technologies, the need for constant maintenance and Chinese-oriented service are an important part of the durative presence of Chinese-built infrastructural systems. The China Made project was initiated with the objective of addressing the absence of what Bach (2016) called the world's paradigmatic infrastructure state in much of the infrastructure studies field. We suspect that this absence was due, in part, to the lingering exceptionalist tendencies in the China studies field itself. This exceptionalism has been subject to criticism within the field for years (Lee, 2022b), but it has only been with the recent rise of a more global China that new analytical approaches and methodologies have shown how it might finally be put to rest (see e.g. Byler, 2022; Oakes, 2021; Franceschini & Loubere, 2022). The papers in this special section demonstrate in various ways how the relational nature of infrastructures provides a valuable pathway for analysing China's increasingly global presence without reducing the particularities of that presence to 'Chinese characteristics'. Such a reductionist move remains all too common as the still somewhat insular China studies field confronts the rapid integration of China's political economy into global patterns of capital circulation, accumulation, and related processes. Understanding infrastructure as linked to a global field of power is important for understanding the ability of Chinese actors to influence national and subnational systems particularly in the global South—the primary site of China's Belt and Road Initiative. This, in turn, produces a sharper understanding of the way the domestic political legitimation at local and national levels inform the cross-regional transfer of material, technology and expertise. It also demonstrates the way the surpluses of capital and labour in China's domestic economy contributes to the world system. All of this points toward a global present and future that is multipolar, and thus in greater forms of flux. The social life of Chinese infrastructures in Southeast Asia is a story that is still unfolding and that will always exceed analysis. But understanding some of the primary domains of practice and modes of power that drive these infrastructural systems offers some important points of focus for evaluating their effects and the future life of infrastructures already in motion.

Monte-Carlo Simulation Based Value-at-Risk for Non-Gaussian Seasonal Stochastic Volatility Model,"<title>Abstract</title> Commodity option has relatively low correlations with equities and bonds and is a good diversification asset to a portfolio compared with traditional assets. However, commodity has seasonal patterns compared with other assets. In this article, we combine stochastic volatility model with seasonal patterns and do risk measurement such as calculating options' value-at-risk (VaR). We also study non-Gaussian stochastic volatility model in student \(t\) distribution and skew-student-$t$ distribution instead of usual Gaussian distribution which take skewness and fat tails into consideration with tail losses and extreme events typical of commodity markets. Our results demonstrate that non-Gaussian distributed seasonal stochastic volatility model can better estimate VaR and has higher probability that extreme cases may happen. This research suggests that our model can serve as a powerful tool for investors seeking to manage risks more effectively in volatile commodity markets, highlighting the importance of considering both seasonal influences and distributional characteristics in financial modeling.",2024-03-22,
A Study on Consumer Behavior in Selection of Personal Care Products based on their Financial Status,"This research delves into the labyrinth of consumer behaviour, dissecting the nuanced preferences in the realm of personal care product selection. Focusing on the pivotal influence of financial status, our study seeks to unravel the intricate tapestry of choices made by individuals across diverse economic backgrounds. From essential grooming items to indulgent self-care commodities, the research delineates the spectrum of consumer decisions influenced by income brackets. Moreover, it uncovers potential shifts in consumer preferences amidst economic fluctuations and their implications for the personal care industry. As we navigate through the labyrinth of consumer behaviour, this study not only contributes valuable insights to marketers and policymakers but also prompts a re-evaluation of societal perceptions surrounding personal care choices. By understanding the symbiotic relationship between financial status and consumer behaviour, we hope to foster a more nuanced discourse on the intricate dynamics governing our daily grooming rituals.",2024-03-22,
"Economics of HIV Prevention: Understanding the Empirical Intersection between Commodity Price Shocks, Health Spending and HIV Infections in Developing Countries","Background: This study seeks to understand the empirical nature of macro-financial factors associated with the worsening of HIV infections and the risks that need to be carefully monitored for a sustainable improvement in HIV outcomes as developing countries seek to achieve the United Nations 95-95-95 targets. Methods: The author used a panel VAR model to study the long-term endogenous relationships between percentage changes in the annual spot price of the most traded commodities, GDP per capita, health spending, and the HIV infection rate of developing countries. Results: The author discovered that shocks of global commodity prices negatively impact GDP per capita, real government health spending, and real private health spending. These shocks have adverse spillover effects characterized by worsening HIV infections. The reactions from price shocks suggest that GDP per capita contract immediately when a commodity price shock hits developing economies. Real government health spending and real private health spending also contract instantly. HIV infections begin worsening three years after the shock in the energy and precious metal blocks of countries. HIV infections also begin to worsen two years after shocks in the agricultural block of counties. These impacts are statistically significant and can potentially reverse the positive HIV infection gains achieved in the previous years. Emergency funds, insurance schemes, and international aid for HIV need to discharge more funds to counter these shocks. Conclusions: There is a significant risk of reversing HIV infection outcomes arising from commodity price shocks. Funding agencies must protect HIV prevention services from global macro-economic shocks as countries move closer to the United Nations 95-95-95 targets.",2024-03-21,
Not so ‘dumb money’? Constituting professionals and amateurs in the history of finance capitalism,"This article examines the historically contentious relationship between the financial market and the public as discussed in academic literature, financial journalism and prescriptive how-to invest handbooks during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although financial markets thrive off active public participation, speculating at stock and commodity exchanges has been a sanctioned ritual reserved for a privileged minority. We argue that the financial establishment’s intent to control market access through financial entry-barriers (such as exchange membership fees and margin requirements) has been part of a bigger story we need to understand: a history of delegitimating uninitiated ‘lay speculators’ through the construction of exclusionary narratives about unfit amateur investors and morally corrupt publics. We conceptualize this process as an ongoing and delicate boundary-making exercise contributing to a market participation discourse that has been characterized by a set of reductive binaries, such as those of insider–outsider, professional–amateur and speculator–gambler. We show, however, that attempts to delineate popular participation in financial markets through these binaries have been complicated by the idea that besides being a force of market instability and collective irrationality, the public was a largely untapped source of liquidity. We argue that today’s discourse on public participation in financial markets resuscitates these simplified narratives and propose a more nuanced view of non-professional market participants being both destabilizers and liquidity-providers.",2024-03-21,
Frontiers in Operations: News Event-Driven Forecasting of Commodity Prices,"Problem definition: Commodity prices have exhibited significant volatility in recent times, which poses an exogenous risk factor for commodity-processing and commodity-trading firms. Accurate commodity price forecasts can help firms leverage data-driven procurement policies that incorporate the underlying price volatility for financial and operational hedging decisions. However, historical prices alone are insufficient to obtain reasonable forecasts because of the extreme volatility. Methodology/results: Building on the hypothesis that commodity prices are driven by real-world events, we propose a method that automatically extracts events from news articles and combines them with price data using a neural network-based predictive model to forecast prices. In addition to achieving a high prediction accuracy that outperforms several benchmarks (by up to 13%), our proposed model is also interpretable, which allows us to identify meaningful events driving the price fluctuations. We found that the events frequently associated with major fluctuations in the price include “natural,” “hike,” “policy,” and “elections,” all of which are known drivers of price change. We used a corpus containing about 1.6 million news articles of a major Indian newspaper spanning 15 years and daily prices of four crops (onion, potato, rice, and wheat) in India to perform this study. Our proposed approach is flexible and can be used to predict other time series data, such as disease incidence levels or macroeconomic indicators, that are also influenced by real-world events. Managerial implications: Firms can leverage price forecasts from our system to design inventory and procurement policies in the face of uncertain commodity prices. Commodity merchants can also use the forecasts to design optimal storage policies for physical trading of commodities when prices are volatile. Our findings can also significantly impact policymakers, who can leverage the information of impending price changes and associated events to mitigate the negative effects of price shocks.

STRATEGY OF FARM DEVELOPMENT ON THE BASIS OF MARKETING,"Farming activities contribute to fuller employment of farmers, generating additional income, social and other effects, and to the formation of the state's food security. For farmers, it is important that their income and other effects are not only constant over time, but also grow steadily, which requires each farm to achieve a certain rhythm in the formation of technological processes, costs and income, which ensures the sustainability of reproduction processes. The most important features of farm development are not only the constant reproduction of resources and economic relations, but also the maintenance of strong market positions, which can only be achieved through the maximum use of internal and external opportunities over a long period of time. The most significant of these measures are those of a strategic nature. Therefore, each farm needs to formulate an effective investment-oriented strategy for its development. However, most farms do not have such strategies, which often leads them to financial instability and bankruptcy, especially in times of war. Implementation of scientifically sound sustainable development strategies is the key to successful farming operations over time. The resilience of farms to the stresses of war was negatively affected by postponed institutional reforms and the long-standing problem of insufficient investment. In particular, agroholding of agriculture, structural inter- and intra-industry imbalances, dominance of raw materials in exports, large tonnage of crop exports, monopolization of input markets and logistics infrastructure, one-sided dependence of exports on sea transportation, and others. The role of family farms and small businesses, as well as alternative activities in the context of rural development, was underestimated. Ukraine's economy has been developing in an unstable environment for a long time, characterized by alternating periods of decline and intensification of investment processes in agriculture, including farms. In such an unstable environment, capital investment in the rehabilitation of farms is a crucial factor in the growth of not only their commodity output and profits, but also the country's gross domestic product. The United Nations has declared 2019-2028 as the Decade of Family Farming and developed a Global Action Plan for the development of such farms. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), more than 83% of gross livestock production and more than 51% of crop production in the world are produced by farms. Thus, there is an urgent need for further development of farms as a socio-economic phenomenon. Sustainable development of agricultural production and environmental protection in the long term can only be ensured by properly meeting the needs and expectations of farmers and other stakeholders, provided that an appropriate balance of organizational, economic, and social factors of farms is maintained. Therefore, the basis for the development of farms and its basic principles should be the implementation of state policy aimed at introducing the provision that the basis of the agrarian economy and rural development should be the farm system. The proposed monograph also substantiates the organizational and economic foundations of farmers' development based on the transformation of individual peasant farms into family farms.",2024-03-20,
Geopolitical Risk And Responses To Financial Markets,"The Geopolitical risk (GPR) generated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered various impacts and responses in terms of financial markets and investors’ sentiments regarding sensible actions. The purpose of this study was to focus on GPR and responses to financial assets and commodities using a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. The results uncovered differences in the various responses of financial assets and commodities in different durations. It was found that under increasing GPR, gold is a safe haven for energy commodities, while bitcoin is safe haven for the capital market, and treasury bonds and US dollars are a safe haven for other various financial assets as well as commodities such as energy. Since gold’s behavior is determined by itself, investment in gold can help reduce risk in portfolios when there is an increase in geopolitical risk and at times of a bearish market.",2024-03-20,
Accounting for complementary currency transactions (the case for France),"The purpose of the study was to analyze the complementary currencies projects (СС-projects) implemented in France during the last decades. The active promotion of those projects in various countries has highlighted the problem of accounting and tax accounting for transactions of the currencies supplementing the national ones as a means of payment. There were questions about how to reflect and record such payments in invoices; whether it is necessary to purchase additional software for the cash register, etc. The author of the article proved that the use of complementary currencies does not significantly affect the billing and cash accounting, as well as the collection of commercial taxes, since the sales are always recorded in the national currency and in the same currency are transferred to accounting for further documentation (in this case, in euros). The tax reporting within the CC-projects is identical to the standard formalized one, however, the payment terms contained in it include an additional payment method. the methodological basis of the study was a system- functional approach and comparativistics. the results of the work have revealed the specifics and key problems of forming a legislative framework for innovative projects aimed at introducing new effective payment instruments into the sphere of commodity- money relations at the regional and local levels, and may be of interest to economists and representatives or specialists of taxation and financial services of Russia.",2024-03-19,
Financial inclusion through Islamic financial instruments: A catalyst for small and medium enterprises (SMEs),"The term Islamic finance is used to refer to financial activities conforming to Islamic Law (Sharia). One of the main principles of the Islamic finance system is the prohibition of the payment and the receipt of riba (interest) in a financial transaction. The term riba covers all forms of interest and is not limited to usury or excessive interest only. The most critical and significant implication of banning interest is the indirect prohibition of a “pure” debt security. The key point to bear in mind is that Islamic law does not recognize money and money instruments as a commodity but merely as a medium of exchange. Hence any return must be tied to an asset, or participation and risk-taking in a joint enterprise (such as partnerships). A pure debt security is replaced with an “asset-linked” security, direct financing of a real asset, and different forms of partnerships of which equity financing is the most desirable. In addition to prohibition of riba, there are several other important provisions which may affect financial transactions. These include the prohibition of ‘gharar’ (uncertainty or asymmetrical information), ‘maysir’ (gambling, speculation), hoarding, as well as trading in prohibited commodities (for example, pork and alcohol).",2024-03-19,
Cascading socio-economic and financial impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"Abstract Disruptions in global food and energy trade can trigger cascading socio-economic losses. Financial markets can amplify such losses and generate systemic cross- sectoral effects, e.g. on food insecurity. Our novel methodology links the real economy and financial markets to quantify such cascading losses and to capture amplification effects by financial markets. We study the Russia-Ukraine conflict and find large, regionally and sectorally heterogeneous cascading impacts. Com- paring with real data confirms that our approach captures several key impacts of the crisis: the energy price increase in Europe, the strong reaction of European commodity future markets with large benefits for fossil companies (equity values up to +54%) and losses for companies most exposed to the belligerents (up to -6%), and the worsening of food affordability especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America (additionally 10 million people at risk of hunger). Our analysis shows the importance of accounting for cascading risks and amplification effects to strengthen economic, financial, and food system resilience.",2024-03-19,
Changing international hegemony and dependency in peripheral countries: A case study of Latin America,"The literature on demand-driven growth models, while an important contribution to comparative political economy, places too much emphasis on developed countries and too little on the international political economic context. To extend these models to the periphery, where international influence is especially important, it is suggested that theories of hegemony and dependency be incorporated into the analysis. The main argument is that international relationships can limit the ability of peripheral countries to produce more sophisticated goods and attain high-income status. The nature of the limits varies with the needs of the hegemon (or rising hegemon), which are met via three dependency mechanisms: markets, leverage, and linkage. The proposed approach is illustrated by a study of Latin America from 1990 to 2020. After following a consumption-led model from the end of WWII until the debt crisis of the 1980s, a new export-led model was introduced in the 1990s, with different variants in the northern and southern parts of the hemisphere and different “winners” and “losers.” In the 1990s, US dominance favored Mexico through its incorporation into US industrial value chains, while China’s entrance into the region after 2000 privileged South America’s commodity producers. The trade and financial advantages afforded the two subregions by the respective powers were offset by negative aspects of the dependent relationships. Mexico’s sophisticated industries financed by US FDI benefited only certain enclaves in the country, while South America suffered reprimarization and deindustrialization through its new links with China.",2024-03-18,
Commodity ETFs: Do They Add Value?,"The use of commodities to hedge inflation risk and diversify portfolios is an important component of portfolio management. Most individual investors do not have the assets and/or the expertise to invest directly in commodities. As an alternative, individual investors increasingly have resorted to the use of commodity-based investments such as ETFs. But are they delivering the benefits investors expect? In this article, we evaluate the performance and diversification benefits of equally-weighted portfolios of commodity ETFs from January 2005 through December 2020. We find that the introduction of commodity ETFs has led to a much higher commodity-stock correlation and a moderate decline in commodity-bond correlation. We also compare performance of the commodity ETF portfolio to the US stock market as measured by the S&P 500 ETF (IVV), and to the bond market using the total bond market ETF (AGG). We find that the commodity ETF portfolios have underperformed both the US stock and bond markets and have inferior absolute- and risk-adjusted performance. This inferior performance may be explained by the increase in assets under management in these commodity funds, resulting in an increase in long hedges that shifted the market from normal backwardation to contango. A futures contract in a contango market has a high futures price relative to the expected spot price that would result in a negative expected return. The commodity ETF portfolios, however, outperformed IVV during the 2007 financial crisis—indicating that they are an effective bear market hedge against stocks.",2024-03-16,
"Exploring the dynamic links, implications for hedging and investment strategies between Sukuk and commodity market volatility: Evidence from country level analysis","This research paper examines the influence of spillovers between volatility of commodities (including soft commodities, precious metals, industrial metals, along with energy) and returns of sukuk. Using a notable sample of fifteen sukuk country indices and sixteen products, we examine the time-varying criterion vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) based extended joint connectedness method and contribute to the correlation analysis literature by supplying a comprehensive as well as policy-oriented analysis of the connection between sukuks and also commodities. Our results disclose that the system-wide dynamic connectedness is slowly heterogeneous and driven by financial occasions. Next, we look at the potential determinants of connectivity between sukuk and commodity markets, we find that global risk factors significantly impact the degree of spillovers between markets. In particular, the negative impacts of risk factors on spillovers suggest that some risk-mitigating properties may be related to market leverage in the composite portfolio in bear market conditions. In addition, our results, using hedging efficiency and the Sharpe ratio, confirm the hypothesis of diversification opportunities between markets that leverage dynamic connectivity networks.",2024-03-15,
Governmental Discussion on the Private Capital Participation in the Trans-Caspian Railway Construction in the Late XIX Century,"The ambivalence of the approaches of Russian ministries at the end of the XIX century is demonstrated, in relation to public-private partnership in the framework of the implementation of the railway project in the Trans-Caspian General Government.There is presented a system of arguments in support of this approach and against it; the author clarifies the reason for the government’s rejection of the idea of public-private partnership in the construction of the Trans-Caspian railway. The source base of the study is the protocols of the meeting of the government commission, letters from government officials, statistical information on the turnover of commodities with Persia and other materials stored in the Foreign Policy Archive of the Russian Empire and in the Central State Archive of Moscow. The author concludes that the formal basis for rejecting the application of entrepreneurs for the implementation of this railway was the ineffectiveness of the financial model of their participation in the framework of this project. The real reason for this decision was the position of the officials of the government departments that opposed attracting private investors to the implementation of this transport project in the Central Asian region due to the military-strategic and geopolitical aspects.",2024-03-15,
Disruption,"Both the West and the Soviet bloc struggled with the slowdown of economic growth; chaos in the international monetary system; inflation; shocks in the commodities markets; and the emergence of offshore financial markets. The superpowers had previously disseminated resources to their allies to enhance their own national security, but the disappearance of postwar conditions during the 1970s forced Washington and Moscow to choose between promoting their own economic interests and supporting their partners in Europe and Asia. This book shows that new unexpected macroeconomic imbalances in global capitalism sustained the West during the following decade. Rather than a creditor nation and net exporter, as it had been during the postwar period, the United States became a net importer of capital and goods during the 1980s, which helped fund public spending, stimulated economic activity, and lubricated the private sector. The United States could now live beyond its means and continue waging the Cold War, and its allies benefited from access to the booming US market and the strengthened US military umbrella. As the book demonstrates, a new symbiotic economic architecture powered the West, but the Eastern European regimes increasingly became a burden to the Soviet Union. They were drowning in debt, and the Kremlin no longer had the resources to rescue them.",2024-03-15,
"Time Frequency and Co-movements between Global Economic Policy Uncertainty, Precious Metals and Agricultural Prices: A Wavelet Coherence Analysis and Bootstrap Rolling Window Granger Causality","Examining the links between economic uncertainty and precious metals allows us to explore the interconnectedness of various economic factors and their potential impact on markets, investments, and global trade. Precious metals such as gold and silver have historically been used as safe havens during times of economic uncertainty. Understanding how these metals interact with fluctuating economic policies can help assess their role as a safe haven and their importance to investors. Analyzing the links between precious metals, economic uncertainty, and agricultural prices can help policymakers design measures to mitigate negative impacts on the economy and foster financial and food stability. The main objective of this paper is to examine the co-movements between global economic policy uncertainty and each commodity such as oil, precious metals and agricultural prices. We employ two empirical approaches such as wavelet coherence and bootstrap rolling window Granger causality. The dynamic causality according to the bivariate framework between variables is analyzed. We used monthly data during the period span from January 2004 to September 2022. Empirical results indicate the evidence of unidirectional, bidirectional and absence of causality between variables. In addition the co-movements between GEPU and each variable are positive and negative.",2024-03-15,
Misrecognitions,"Misrecognitions mounts a vigorous defense of the labyrinthine plotting of Victorian novels, notorious for their implausible concluding revelations and coincidences. Critics have long decried Victorian recognition scenes—the reunions and retroactive discoveries of identity that too conveniently bring the story to a close—as regrettable contrivances. Ben Parker counters this view by showing how these recognition scenes offer a critique of the social and economic misrecognitions at work in nineteenth-century capitalism. Through a meticulous analysis of novels by Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, and Henry James, as well as Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, Misrecognitions tracks how the Victorian novel translates the financialized abstractions of capital into dramas of buried secrets and disguised relations.

Legal Protection for Digital Currency Investment Activities according to Positive Law in Indonesia,"This study aims to understand and examine the position of digital currency according to positive laws in Indonesia and to determine the Financial Services Authority's (OJK) protection against illegal digital currency investment activities in Indonesia. This research uses a normative research approach. The position of digital currency according to Positive Law in Indonesia is that digital currency in Indonesia is only considered a trade commodity under the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency or Bappebti, as stipulated in Article 1 Number 7 of the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency Regulation Number 5 of 2019 concerning Technical Provisions for the Operation of Crypto Asset Physical Asset Markets on Exchanges. Therefore, digital currency cannot replace the national currency of the Republic of Indonesia, namely the Rupiah. The Financial Services Authority's (OJK) protection against illegal digital currency investment activities in Indonesia is carried out through two methods: preventive and repressive. Preventive measures involve issuing regulations and conducting socialization, while repressive measures involve imposing sanctions.",2024-03-15,
Time Series Financial Market Forecasting Based on Machine Learning,"Forecasting future values of financial market data, including stock prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices, is a challenging and important task in time series financial market forecasting. Using time series analysis, we presented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for predicting trends in the financial markets. Financial market time series data present a challenge to conventional forecasting techniques due to their complicated patterns and intrinsic dynamic nature. Based on past price and volume data, the SVM algorithm—which is renowned for its resilience and capacity to handle high-dimensional data—is used to forecast future market patterns. The study assesses how well SVM captures non-linear correlations in financial time series while taking fluctuating market and economic situations into account.",2024-03-15,
Misrecognitions,"This book mounts a vigorous defense of the labyrinthine plotting of Victorian novels, notorious for their implausible concluding revelations and coincidences. Critics have long decried Victorian recognition scenes—the reunions and retroactive discoveries of identity that too conveniently bring the story to a close—as regrettable contrivances. The book counters this view by showing how these recognition scenes offer a critique of the social and economic misrecognitions at work in nineteenth-century capitalism. Through a meticulous analysis of novels by Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, and Henry James, as well as Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, the book tracks how the Victorian novel translates the financialized abstractions of capital into dramas of buried secrets and disguised relations. Drawing on Karl Marx's account of commodity fetishism and reification, the book contends that, by configuring capital as an enigma to be unveiled, Victorian recognition scenes dramatize the inversions of agency and temporality that are repressed in capitalist production. In plotting capital as an agent of opacity and misdirection, Victorian novels and their characteristic dialectic of illusion and illumination reveal the plot hole in capitalism itself.",2024-03-15,
Tools of regime stability: the political economy of sovereign wealth funds in Gulf rentier states,"Why have Gulf resource-dependent countries transformed the role of their sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) from passive global investors to ubiquitous drivers of economic development? How does this role-change operate amidst fiscal scarcity, confounding macroeconomic expectations of commodity-based SWFs? Beyond a narrow view of funds as apolitical economic actors, this article puts forward the logic of SWFs as tools of regime stability to explain SWF development in Gulf rentier states. This logic advances that SWFs are adaptive strategies through which rentier states respond to evolving external pressure without compromising the fundamental pillars of regime stability underpinning allocative frameworks. Drawing on the Saudi case, the article finds that SWFs create de-risking pathways to mobilize private finance capital through environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and market-based instruments like green bonds. Simultaneously, SWFs allow incumbents to revisit rentier governance by enhancing economic steering capacity while upholding, but restructuring, patronage networks. By shedding light on the political role of SWFs, this article contributes to debates surrounding rentier states and financialization literatures. It highlights how the elasticity of rentierism as financialized forms of state-led economic development does not erode state capacity but rather empowers ruling elites with a new range of tools and resources to upgrade rentier governance in times of economic transitions.",2024-03-13,

The economy showed a strong recovery during the first semester but decelerated afterwards as the reopening effects from the pandemic vanished and in the face of extraordinary events such as the large-scale aggression of Russia against Ukraine which exacerbated the rise in commodity prices. The rise in inflation was intense and persistent. After reaching a peak in the summer, the rate of headline consumer price variation began to decline, but core inflation remained high. The ECB's monetary policy tightening was sharp by historical standards, and financial conditions for companies became more restrictive.",2024-03-13,
ANALISIS PERBANDINGAN METODE ARIMA DAN LEAST SQUARE UNTUK PREDIKSI HARGA EMAS : PENDEKATAN PROBABILISTIK DAN STATISTIK,"Gold, a precious metal renowned for its value in various sectors, including investment and jewelry, is often considered a secure asset within investment portfolios. However, its prices exhibit high volatility influenced by economic, geopolitical, and global financial factors. Previous research has focused on predictive methods to anticipate gold price movements. In recent years, heightened complexity and uncertainty, exacerbated by global factors such as economic shifts and the Covid-19 pandemic, emphasizes the urgency of accurate gold price predictions. This study comprehensively analyzes and compares the performance of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in forecasting gold prices, utilizing statistical and probabilistic approaches. ARIMA excels in handling time series data, identifying complex patterns, and forecasting price changes based on historical trends. Conversely, OLS, a probabilistic method, stands out in adjusting linear models to gold price data, providing detailed insights into influencing factors. The research employs a 5-year gold price dataset (2018-2023) and evaluates the models' performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Results indicate OLS outperforms ARIMA, with lower MSE (45.79 vs. 284.83) and MAPE (0.0026 vs. 0.0066). This study contributes nuanced insights for market participants, investors, and researchers to comprehend commodity market behaviour, particularly in gold, emphasizing the importance of accurate prediction methods in strategic decision-making.",2024-03-13,

"Pandemic, sanctions and anxiety in Russia’s regions: Business expectations nowcasting","The study develops a methodology of business expectations index nowcasting with testing on data for the Russian economy as a whole and its regions. This methodology differs from the existing solutions in that it introduces a Bayesian averaging approach to define a set of search patterns for nowcasting and solves the issue of aggregation of time series by individual queries. The developed indices have shown a high level of adequacy, serving as effective tools to reflect shock events in the country’s economic and political landscape and also as predictors of fluctuations in survey­based expectation indices. The application of the presented methodology has revealed the factors that affect the volatility of business expectations indices depending on the level of development and sectoral specialization of Russian regions. In particular, financial and economic centers of highly developed regions and developed regions with diversified economy show high volatility, while business expectations indices in less developed agrarian and commodity regions show low volatility. These results can be useful for economic policy decisions and are of interest to researchers concerned with economic stability and forecasting.",2024-03-10,
Dynamic connectedness and hedging opportunities of the commodity and stock markets in China: evidence from the TVP-VAR and cDCC-FIAPARCH,"Abstract This study examines the dynamic connectedness and hedging opportunities between CSI300 (China Security Index 300) and copper, gold, PTA (purified terephthalic acid), and soybean in China from January 09, 2008, to June 30, 2023. A TVP-VAR and cDCC-FIAPARCH modeling framework was used for the empirical investigation. The results show that the total connectedness index can effectively capture cross-asset information transmission in China’s financial markets. Copper returns are the dominant volatility transmitters, while CSI300, gold, and soybean returns are net recipients. The Russian–Ukraine war reinforced the safe-haven role of gold. Finally, investors with CSI300 long positions may benefit from prioritizing gold for hedging, while those with CSI300 short positions profit more from allocating gold to PTA. Portfolio managers and investors can use the findings to track the dynamics of systemic risk and adjust their long/short positions when investing in China's stock and commodity markets.",2024-03-08,
Explosive Temperatures,"Introduction &amp;#160; Extreme price episodes are a common feature in many financial as well as commodity markets: the Nasdaq index reached its historical high early in Year 2000, crude oil prices peaked in Summer 2008, and Bitcoin prices hit a record high end of 2017. These episodes have in common that the price behavior can be captured using the statistical concept of (temporary) explosiveness: Phillips et al. (2011, International Economic Review) who also propose a new empirical testing procedure, find evidence of this feature in the Nasdaq prices. The remaining two of the above-mentioned markets have been analysed by the author of this paper: Gronwald (2016, Energy Economics) deals with crude oil markets; Gronwald (2021, Finance Research Letters) analyses cryptocurrency markets. &amp;#160; This paper analyses if the feature of explosiveness can also be found in global as well as hemispheric temperature data. &amp;#160; The literature this analysis contributes to finds its origin in the debate whether temperatures are characterised by deterministic (Estrada et al. 2013, Nature Geoscience) or stochastic (Kaufmann et al. 2013, Climatic Change) trends. A direct motivation for this paper are recent contributions such as Chang et al. (2020) and Holt and Terasvirta (2020, both Journal of Econometrics). Both papers point to differences in the time series behaviour in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Chang et al (2020) find evidence of two stochastic trends in Northern hemispheric data, but only one in the Southern Hemisphere; Holt and Terasvirta (2020) find that shifts in the mean of the Northern series can be adequately characterised by three logistic function components, two are sufficient for the case of the Southern one. &amp;#160; Data &amp;#160; Data is taken from the HadCRUT5 data set provided by the Met Office Hadley Centre. &amp;#160; Finding &amp;#160; The key finding of this paper is that global temperature anomalies are characterised by (temporary) explosiveness. This finding indicates that temperatures, given the extended period without systematic change, increase fast and the witnessed increase is large. What is more, clear evidence of explosiveness is only found in Northern hemispheric data; in the South, this is considerably less pronounced. &amp;#160; Conclusions &amp;#160; What this paper finds is also relevant for the analysis of the relationship between carbon emissions and warming. Among the questions addressed in that literature is whether or not temperatures and radiative forcings from greenhouse gases share the same common trend; in other words, if a cointegration relationship exists. Of particular interest in this context is if that relationship is stable. Papers such as Agliardi et al. (2019, EAERE) as well as Eroglu et al. 2021, Econometric Reviews) epitomise these research efforts. Despite the above-mentioned dispute about the behaviour of the individual series, the conventional view is that there is a stable linear cointegration relationship. This view is based on climate science studies such as Matthews et al. (2009, Nature). The findings of this paper challenge this notion. In addition, this paper shares concerns expressed in Rantanen et al. (2022, CEE) about an underestimation of temperature increases in the Arctic by climate models.",2024-03-08,
Improving Farmers’ Income on Online Agri-Platforms: Evidence from the Field,"Problem definition: To improve the welfare of smallholder farmers, multiple countries (e.g., Ethiopia and India) have launched online agri-platforms to transform traditional markets. However, there is still mixed evidence regarding the impact of these platforms and, more generally, how they can be leveraged to enable more efficient agricultural supply chains and markets. This paper describes work conducted in close collaboration with the state government of Karnataka, India, to design, implement, and assess the impact of a new two-stage auction on the state’s online agri-platform, the United Market Platform (UMP). Methodology/results: To ensure implementability and protect farmers’ revenue, the auction design is guided by practical operational considerations, as well as semistructured interviews with a majority of the traders in the field. A new behavioral auction model informed by the field insights is developed to determine when the proposed two-stage auction can generate a higher revenue for farmers than the traditional single-stage, first-price, sealed-bid auction. The new auction mechanism was implemented on the UMP for a major market of lentils in February 2019. By the end of May 2019, commodities worth more than $6 million (USD) had been traded under the new auction. A difference-in-differences analysis demonstrates that the implementation has yielded a significant 3.6% price increase (corresponding to a 55%–94% profit gain) for over 10,000 farmers who traded in the treatment market. Managerial implications: The results from this paper offer tangible lessons on how innovative price discovery mechanisms could be enabled by online agri-platforms in resource-constrained environments. Importantly, the success of these designs critically depends on careful considerations of systemic operational and behavioral factors that affect trades in the physical markets.

Entrepreneurial finance in Europe and the Russian war against Ukraine,"Abstract Prior research has investigated how the prices of stocks and commodities as well as inflation levels have been affected by the Russian war against Ukraine. So far, however, we know little about the impacts of the war on the entrepreneurial finance sector. Prior research on the effects of unexpected exogenous crisis events on entrepreneurial finance suggests a strong negative impact on new and follow-on funding for entrepreneurial ventures. Our study regards the Russian war against Ukraine as an unexpected exogenous crisis event and explores its impact on the entrepreneurial finance sector. It goes beyond a mere sentiment and impact analysis and also explores the underlying reasons and mechanisms as well as potential response and coping strategies employed by entrepreneurial finance investors. Based on two surveys of European venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) investors, we find that the war had a strong negative impact on the two types of investors and their respective funds. Both VC and PE investors report more risk-aversion of limited partners (LPs) and LPs leaving the market as important challenges resulting in an overall lower willingness of LPs to invest. This applies in particular to banks, insurance funds, and pension funds. On the portfolio firm level, securing equity financing and maintaining liquidity were considered pressing issues. Overall, the situation seems to be more difficult for portfolio companies of VC as compared to PE investors. For the former, the financing- and liquidity-related issues seem to be more existential and survival-threatening. Responding to these challenges, both VC and PE investors altered their industry focus and put more emphasis on entrepreneurial experience. Financial investment selection criteria such as financial valuation, profitability, and cash- as well as revenue-generating capacity also increased in importance. Again, differences between VC and PE investors exist. Our study has implications for entrepreneurial finance theory and practice and concludes with an agenda for research on the impacts of the Russian war against Ukraine on entrepreneurial finance.",2024-03-05,
"Is interest rate hiking a recipe for missing several goals of monetary policy—beating inflation, preserving financial stability, and keeping up output growth?","Abstract After the corona crisis, and even more so when the war in Ukraine struck, the price levels of all goods in the US and Europe rose surprisingly quickly and persistently. The FED began in March 2022 and the ECB in July 2022 with historically unique interest rate increases to combat the wage-price spiral that had not yet begun. In this article we show that energy, commodities and food were the main drivers of inflation. For this reason, central banks' goal of weakening demand for labor through historically large interest rate hikes seems unwise. We argue that the current measures cannot achieve all of their objectives: slowing inflation, stabilizing financial markets and sustaining growth. If interest rates remain high, but external forces emerge with a lasting effect and keep inflation rates high, especially in smaller emerging countries, it will be difficult to counteract this on a country or regional basis through high interest rate policy and national control of the price- and wage-Phillips curve. Significant negative side effects of interest rate hikes increase the risk of not making the necessary investments and, in particular, weaken the bargaining power of particularly vulnerable employment groups. Other tools are needed to curb inflation and keep it under control, for example more investment in sectors with supply disruptions and a massive expansion of investment in renewable energy.",2024-03-05,
A deep learning‐based financial hedging approach for the effective management of commodity risks,"Abstract The development of deep learning technique has granted firms with new opportunities to substantially improve their risk management strategies for sustainable growth. This paper introduces a novel deep learning‐based financial hedging (DL‐HE) strategy to leverage the salient ability of deep learning in extracting nonlinear features from complex high dimensional data, thus boosting the management of inventory risks arising from erratic commodity prices. Using real‐world data, we find that the average annualized economic benefit of the proposed strategy is at least 1.21 million CNY for a typical aluminum firm carrying an average level of inventory in China, as compared with those of the traditional hedging strategies. Further analysis reveals that such an economic benefit can largely be explained by the efficacy of the proposed DL‐HE strategy in terms of significantly improving return while still effectively controlling risk. Moreover, the superior of this strategy remains robust when extending to copper and zinc.",2024-03-05,
"Has the Consumer Perception Changed? An Overview of Consumer Behavior towards Organized Retail Sectors in Kolkata, India","The research paper focuses on the change of consumers’ perception towards purchasing different commodities in the organized retail outlets of Kolkata. The study revealed that the behaviour of a consumer towards a particular outlet mainly depends upon factors like product availability, spending pattern, sales man services, store layout etc. The research shows that currently a large section of consumers is attracted towards the organised retail outlets because of wide range of services like variety of payment options provided by the store, visibility of the billing counter, wide range of brands availability, quality of the products, and better service at the store have majorly attributed to preference of organized retail store over the unorganized outlets. Also, parameters like visibility of display of MRP, discount offers, quality of service at the organized store, trolley service facilities etc. are some of the reasons of inclination of consumers towards organized retail stores as compared to traditional retail formats. The study has found mostly the younger generation consumers are tending to have a tendency towards making new experiences mainly for groceries and have an urge to make spontaneous purchases compared to older generation of consumers. Apart from the positive aspects, the study also observed a bunch of constraints that restricts a consumer from going to an organized retail store which are the factors like lower budget, inability of the lower income group of people due to financial constraints, lack of advertisements, unavailability of low-priced products, most of the necessary products being easily available in the traditional markets, illiteracy etc. are some of the major constraints found in the study which have contributed to 19.48% of variance and has been further renamed as consumers perception by using the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method.",2024-03-05,
Metal and energy price uncertainties and the global economy,"We construct novel monthly measures of energy and metal price uncertainty based on the one-year-ahead price forecast dispersion for twenty commodities. Using a simple VAR model, we show both metal and energy price uncertainty shocks are contractionary for the world economy, and these results are largely robust to a battery of alternative specifications. However, our results highlight the differences between metal and energy price uncertainties, both in terms of their propagation channels, as well as the driving forces behind them. Counterfactual analysis reveals that metal price uncertainty has a mainly direct impact on global economic activity while the impact of energy price uncertainty is indirectly mediated through global financial and economic uncertainties. Variance decomposition shows fluctuations of both metal and energy price uncertainties are mainly self-driven, however global financial uncertainty plays a significant role in driving metal price uncertainty in the short run while global economic activity uncertainty plays a significant role in driving energy price uncertainty in the medium to long run.",2024-03-04,
Impact of COVID-19 Crisis on Volatility Spillovers across Global Financial Markets: Evidence from Asymmetric GARCH Models,"This study investigates the market volatility and asymmetric behavior in the commodity market, foreign exchange market, cryptocurrency, and stock markets by employing asymmetric GARCH models on the daily time series returns. The data covers the period from March 8, 2017, to March 17, 2023, and is divided in to three sub-periods: the entire sample period (March 8, 2017, to March 17, 2023), the pre-COVID-19 period (March 8, 2017, to March 10, 2020), and the during the COVID-19 period (March 11, 2020, to March 17, 2023). The empirical results show a high level of volatility persistence in all the financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the results indicate significant positive asymmetric behavior in the crude oil and stock markets during the pandemic. The findings further document that gold exhibits a strong resilience during the pandemic period, indicating its hedging ability during crisis periods. Moreover, the results suggest that the EGARCH model is the most appropriate model to capture the volatilities of the financial markets both before and during the pandemic. The findings of this study provide useful insights for investors and policymakers, enabling them to adopt effective strategies for investing in portfolios during crisis periods in the future.",2024-03-04,

Unveiling the dance of commodity prices and the global financial cycle,"We examine the impact of commodity price changes on the business cycles and capital flows in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), distinguishing between their role as a source of shock and as a channel of transmission of global shocks. Our findings reveal that surges in export prices, triggered by commodity price shocks, boost domestic GDP, an effect further amplified by the endogenous decline of country spreads. However, the effects on capital flows appear muted. Shifts in U.S. monetary policy and global risk appetite drive the global financial cycle in EMDEs. Eased global credit conditions, attributed to looser U.S. monetary policy or lower global risk appetite, lead to a rise in export prices, higher output, a decrease in government borrowing costs, and stimulate greater capital flows. The endogenous response of export prices amplifies the output effects of a more accommodative U.S. monetary policy while country spreads magnify the impact of shifts in global risk appetite.",2024-03-01,
Impact of China on commodity exporters,"Abstract We compare the effect of a domestic shock in China and the US on the real economy and financial markets of various commodity‐exporting countries. To obtain a reliable indicator for China's macroeconomic conditions, we estimate a Bayesian dynamic factor model using block‐exclusion restrictions to identify a China factor and a US factor from monthly macroeconomic data for China and the US. We, then, assess the implications of a negative shock to both factors on the macroeconomy of a commodity‐exporting nation using Bayesian FAVARs based on recursive identification. A negative China shock leads to output loss and a fall in stock prices in these countries. China shock affects the output of only a subset of countries in our sample compared to the US shock, which affects all countries. China shock has a larger, quicker and more persistent impact on the stock markets of commodity‐exporting countries compared to the US shock. Countries with weaker institutional or business environments experience a larger negative real effect of the China shock, whereas countries with less stable financial systems demonstrate stronger financial effects. Using historical decomposition, we establish a growing role of the China factor over time, in particular for large emerging economies such as Brazil and Russia.",2024-03-01,
The Trend of Public Spending and its Impact on Some Macroeconomic Variables in Iraq,"The research investigates the trend of containing the impact of external economic shocks on some of the financial variables in countries exporting primary commodities, especially oil — and Iraq is selected as the sample in this research. The purpose of this research is to predict the role of fiscal policy in the context of the impact of external economic shocks on macroeconomic variables. The research adopts the standard methodology of the Vector Error Correction Model test to find the co-integration of the public spending model. The results of the study reveal that a shock in public spending leads to an increase in money supply, inflation and aggregate consumption. The conclusion indicates that there is an equilibrium relationship between the variables of the model (money supply, inflation rate, total consumption, the dummy variable, and government spending). The research’s main recommendation include the diversification of the base of the Iraqi economy and create an economy characterized by a gradual increase in the contribution to other economic sectors. This contributes to the formation of the gross domestic product and the diversification of the structure of public revenues. It also prepares for the change of the Iraqi economy from the rentier economy into the market economy. The aim of the research is to reach findings that prevent the Iraqi economy and the public budget from sudden fluctuations in oil revenues.",2024-03-01,

OUTSOURCING OF LOGISTICS FUNCTIONS AS A MECHANISM TO ENSURE EFFICIENT OPERATION OF ENTERPRISES,"The article considers the combination of efficiency of application of logistics tools and the tendency of concentration of enterprises on the main types of activity, which provides ample opportunities for development of the market of logistics outsourcing and specialised logistics intermediaries. One of the most radical and effective ways to reduce costs is the so-called logistics outsourcing, which is used by almost all Western companies. In business, the word ""logistics"" refers to activities related to the organisation and optimisation of commodity, financial and information flows. The term outsourcing means the use of external (material, intellectual, labour) resources; abandoning one's own, often not key or profitable, business process and purchasing services to implement the business process from another organisation. This solution allows the company to focus on its core business. When it comes to improving the efficiency of logistics, it is very important to introduce new digital technologies and systems. For example, the use of logistics management software and IoT devices can help keep track of inventory and deliveries in a timely manner, which will help ensure smooth logistics operations. This approach allows you to control inventory and optimise transport routes, which ultimately reduces costs for your business. In addition, focusing on core business is key for companies seeking to remain competitive. By focusing their efforts on their strengths, such as developing new logistics tools and marketing, companies can stand out in the market. Conversely, by outsourcing support functions, such as logistics, to providers, companies can benefit from expertise and resources while managing their resources more efficiently. Outsourcing of logistics operations plays an important role in maximising strengths and ensuring sustainable development of the company. Finally, we believe that outsourcing logistics functions to partners is an approach aimed at maintaining operational efficiency. By integrating logistics tools and focusing on core operations, companies can increase their competitiveness and achieve sustainable growth.",2024-03-01,
THE COMMODITY PUZZLE OF THE CONNECTOGRAPHIC INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF FINANCIAL MARKETS,"Purpose. Scientific substantiation of the essence of interconnectedness of commodity markets and its impact on the price dynamics of goods in the context of globalisation. Methodology of research. In the course of the research, the following general scientific and special methods were used: induction and deduction - at the stage of collecting, systematizing, and processing information to identify trends and cause-and-effect relationships in the interconnectedness of commodity markets, as well as to predict possible scenarios for price dynamics development; analysis and synthesis - to identify the main trends in the development of global raw material markets, develop proposals for risk management and price stabilization; abstract-logical - to summarize information from various sources and create a comprehensive understanding of the researched problem, form theoretical conclusions and generalizations; comparative method - to analyze the main vectors of interaction between the oil, gold, silver, and other raw material markets to identify global patterns and cause-and-effect relationships between them; fundamental analysis method - to study the mutual influence and interconnectedness of related markets, particularly between the oil, gold, and silver markets with financial markets; graphical method - to visualize the research results. Findings. The theoretical foundations and essential characteristics of the interconnectedness of commodity markets, their relationship, and influence on financial markets as adjacent markets have been considered and systematized. The impact of price dynamics on major raw material markets, such as oil, gold, silver, and others, under globalization conditions has been analyzed. It has been established that the high interconnectedness between markets creates difficulties in forecasting and managing price fluctuations. It was found that changes in oil prices have a significant impact on production costs in many industries, which, in turn, affects the prices of other raw materials. The interconnectedness between the markets of metals and energy carriers has been analyzed. An increase in oil prices leads to higher metal prices due to increased production and transportation costs. It has been determined that the markets for gold and silver demonstrate synchronous movements due to their role as investment assets, especially during periods of economic instability. It has been established that agricultural commodity prices also depend on the cost of energy carriers. Thus, the research results confirm the high degree of interconnectedness between different commodity markets and emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to their analysis and management to ensure stable economic development and financial stability. Originality. The essence of the interconnectedness of commodity markets and its impact on the price dynamics of raw materials have been scientifically substantiated. It is argued that the interconnectedness of commodity markets is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, determined not only by economic but also by political and technological factors. The main characteristics of the interconnectedness between the markets of oil, gold, silver, and other key raw materials have been generalized, and their role in ensuring the stability of the global economy under globalization conditions has been substantiated. Empirical analysis has shown that changes in oil prices significantly affect other commodity markets, particularly metals and agricultural products, due to increased production costs. It has been found that an increase in oil prices leads to higher prices for metals, such as nickel and aluminum, as well as for agricultural products. The study demonstrated that the markets for gold and silver show synchronous movements due to their role as investment assets during periods of economic instability. For the first time, the impact of technological innovations on the price dynamics of commodity markets has been systematized. It has been proven that the development of shale oil extraction technologies in the USA significantly increased supply in the market, reducing oil prices. Moreover, the growth of investments in renewable energy sources decreases the demand for traditional energy carriers, which also affects their price dynamics. The impact of geopolitical events and economic crises on the interconnectedness of commodity markets has been studied. It has been found that political instability in oil-producing countries can cause a sharp rise in oil prices, which affects the prices of metals and agricultural products. Analysis has shown that global economic crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly impact commodity markets by changing investment flows and increasing demand for safe-haven assets such as gold. All the aforementioned factors allow us to conclude that the interconnectedness between commodity, raw material, and financial markets, especially adjacent ones, is strengthening. This confirms the architectural complexity of the current global financial system and the existence and enhancement, in terms of Parag Khanna’s connectography, of interconnectedness in the global financial system on various spatial levels, including transversal connections. Thus, the scientific novelty of the research results lies in the comprehensive analysis of the interconnectedness of commodity markets, the identification of the main mechanisms of their interaction and influence on price dynamics, and the development of effective risk management strategies to ensure stable economic development and financial stability. Practical value. The conclusions and recommendations substantiated by the research results can be used to develop effective risk management strategies in commodity markets, stabilize raw material prices, and make informed decisions regarding investments in energy infrastructure and renewable energy sources. This will contribute to stable economic development and financial stability under globalization conditions. Key words: Interconnectedness, connectographic interconnectedness, price dynamics, global financial system, raw materials, oil, gold, silver, economic stability, globalization, risk management, geopolitical events, technological innovations, financial stability.",2024-03-01,
Determinants of Agricultural Futures Price Volatility: Literature Review,"In recent years, China's agricultural futures prices have experienced significant fluctuations, which have a profound impact on the agricultural and financial markets. While, the volatility of futures price, which becomes a key indicator for measuring market risk, has gradually caught scholars’ and stakeholders’ eyes. Differing from the rationality of investors and the sufficiency of arbitrage, the traditional and the behavioral finance have made fruitful and complementary works on this topic. By reviewing the relevant literature, this article aims to clarify the traditional and behavioral factors that affect the volatility of agricultural futures prices. In addition, this article find that with the development of financialization in commodity futures markets, the influence of irrational factors in the market has become increasingly important. Specifically, behavioral financial factors such as investor sentiments and irrational investor behaviors have become increasingly important in influencing agricultural futures prices. This may provide references and materials for relevant studies and help participants control risks accurately. In summary, under the background of commodity financialization, it is important to study the price fluctuations of agricultural product futures from the perspectives of traditional finance and behavioral finance.",2024-03-01,

The Price of Slavery: Capitalism and Revolution in the Caribbean by Nick Nesbitt (review),"Reviewed by: The Price of Slavery: Capitalism and Revolution in the Caribbean by Nick Nesbitt Philip Kaisary Nick Nesbitt. The Price of Slavery: Capitalism and Revolution in the Caribbean. Charlottesville, VA: University of Virginia Press, 2022. Pp. viii + 274. Ever since the publication in 1944 of Eric Williams's monumental and pathbreaking Capitalism and Slavery, debate has raged over the relationship between slavery and capitalism. Moreover, in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, a remarkable upsurge of scholarly work which has captured a broad public readership has addressed the capitalist dimensions of Atlantic slavery, affirming the plantation-based mode of production as indispensable to global capital accumulation. Into this maelstrom enters Nick Nesbitt's The Price of Slavery: Capitalism and Revolution in the Caribbean, a timely, provocative, and magisterial intervention that makes plain what these debates have been missing for the past eighty years. The novelty and theoretical brilliance of Nesbitt's new book can be discerned at the outset by the stated focus on ""the nature of capitalist slavery and colonialism as social forms."" (1, emphasis added.) In the book's bracing opening chapter, for example, the focus on social form enables Nesbitt's argument that the entire, long-running historicist debate inaugurated by Williams's famous study ""has entirely and without exception […] missed the forest for the trees"" (17). ""Empiricist, data-driven"" argument and counterargument have been, Nesbitt reveals, ""utterly inadequate to address the radical question Williams places before us, that of the relation of slavery and capitalism"" (19). Problematizing ""circular,"" ""backwards,"" and anti-theoreticist reasoning (33), Nesbitt quite brilliantly reveals the shortcomings of arguments that have maintained because slavery generated prodigious wealth it gave birth to modern capitalism. After all, as Nesbitt reminds us, from ""Croesus of Lydia [to] the Spanish plunder of the Americas […] the annals of history brim with amassed riches, profits and palaces"" (19). As such, the terms deployed by Williams and those who have followed in his wake are simply ""incapable of supporting (or disproving)"" the proposition that slavery was ""decisive"" in the development of global capitalism (19). Therefore, instead of entering an historiographic debate over profits, productivity or political economy, Nesbitt sets out on the path of theoretical clarification. Chapter 1 offers an excoriating literature review that makes the case that the relation between slavery and capitalism is best conceived of via Marx's concept of social form. Chapter 2 then reconstructs Marx's categorical analysis of capitalist slavery to reveal the implications of Marx's insistence that under the capitalist social form enslaved laborers are commodities incapable of generating surplus value. The reward for such painstaking reconstructive work is the revelation of ""the specifically capitalist form of chattel slavery"" (103). Chapter 3 opens the book's second part in which the focus shifts to ""Black Jacobinism"" and addresses C. L. R. James's three-part explanation (the idea of freedom, a resolute mass struggle, and—most controversially—leaders of genius) for the Haitian Revolution's successful destruction of the capitalist social form of plantation slavery. Chapter 4 examines the competing social forms that replaced slavery in St. Domingue/Haiti from 1791 to 1820 in relation to ""the subsumption of Haiti within the expanding order of global capitalism"" (131) and the categorical concept of a ""modern proletariat"" as elaborated by James and Marx. The book's fifth and final chapter adroitly teases out contradictions in Aimé Césaire's repeated calls for the industrialization of Martinique and the ""quasi-ecological critique of industrial civilization"" elsewhere in his writing (177). Similarly, Nesbitt notes, we can also observe a contradictory celebration of industrialization cheek by jowl with a lyrical paean to the Haitian natural world in the fiction of Jacques Stephen Alexis. Finally, in a rousing culmination that resonates powerfully ""in our twenty-first century of global warming and ecological devastation"" (176), Nesbitt argues that in Suzanne Césaire's essays we encounter a refusal of appeals to industrialization, a ""vehement critique of the ideology of development,"" and the identification of the capitalist social form of wage labor as a causal explanation for Antillean injustice and inequality (184). The Price of Slavery is a richly theorized intervention into the contemporary debate...",2024-03-01,
Understanding the role of the Tanzania national health insurance fund in improving service coverage and quality of care,"Health insurance is one of the main financing mechanisms currently being used in low and middle-income countries to improve access to quality services. Tanzania has been running its National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) since 2001 and has recently undergone significant reforms. However, there is limited attention to the causal mechanisms through which NHIF improves service coverage and quality of care. This paper aims to use a system dynamics (qualitative) approach to understand NHIF causal pathways and feedback loops for improving service coverage and quality of care at the primary healthcare level in Tanzania. We used qualitative interviews with 32 stakeholders from national, regional, district, and health facility levels conducted between May to July 2021. Based on the main findings and themes generated from the interviews, causal mechanisms, and feedback loops were created. The majority of feedback loops in the CLDs were reinforcing cycles for improving service coverage among beneficiaries and the quality of care by providers, with different external factors affecting these two actions. Our main feedback loop shows that the NHIF plays a crucial role in providing additional financial resources to facilities to purchase essential medical commodities to deliver care. However, this cycle is often interrupted by reimbursement delays. Additionally, beneficiaries' perception that lower-level facilities have poorer quality of care has reinforced care seeking at higher-levels. This has decreased lower level facilities' ability to benefit from the insurance and improve their capacity to deliver quality care. Another key finding was that the NHIF funding has resulted in better services for insured populations compared to the uninsured. To increase quality of care, the NHIF may benefit from improving its reimbursement administrative processes, increasing the capacity of lower levels of care to benefit from the insurance and appropriately incentivizing providers for continuity of care.",2024-02-29,
Design of the Bali Province Food Security Action Plan towards Food Independence,"The problem of hunger is one of the problems that still occur in Indonesia. The problem of hunger is closely related to the problem of staple foods, such as the unmet security of staple food, rice as the community's main food, and the increasing demand for staple foods. This research aims to analyze the challenges faced by Bali Province in maintaining sustainable food security and to design food security action designs in Bali Province towards food independence. The data used in this research are primary data and secondary data with a descriptive analysis method using ISM analysis. The results of the research show that food challenges that occur in Bali Province include reduced agricultural land, unbalanced supply and demand for food commodities, weak use and mastery of technology, lack of farming management and product marketing, the proportion of crop loss and food waste is still quite high, food loss due to inaccuracy in handling food, the area of agricultural land per capita is very limited, the number of young people interested in working in the agricultural sector is still problematic, the age of farmers over 45 years reaches 64.2%, Indonesia is also still facing three times the burden of nutrition, climate change, and hydrometeorological disasters.

Effects of Macroeconomic Variables on the Performance of Mutual Funds: Evidence from Bangladesh Financial Market,"Using multiple regression analysis in this research paper, this is examined that these macroeconomic variables (Money Supply-M2, Inflation Rates and Exchange Rates) have significant relationships with the performance of mutual funds (represented by monthly return based on NAV) in Bangladesh. According to this project paper, money supply M2 has negative relationship with the performance of mutual funds in the financial market of Bangladesh. Because, higher level of money supply in the market weaken the monetary value of taka which makes the market more vulnerable. And this vulnerable market leads a negative impact on the whole financial market as well as mutual fund industry. Interest rates have positive relationship with the performance of mutual funds in the financial market of Bangladesh because higher level of interest rate increases the tendency of savings in the ultimate consumers and they try to consume less and save more. This savings is going to be invested in the capital market as well as in mutual fund industry which leads the market to a better position for the fund managers. Inflation rates have negative relationship with the performance of mutual funds in the financial market of Bangladesh as the higher level of inflation make the price of commodities higher and the monetary price of the taka lower. This tendency of making the less value of money, most of the investors want to withdraw their investment from the market which leads a downturn in the financial market as well as in the mutual fund industry. At the end, exchange rates have positive relationship with the performance of mutual funds as the higher level of exchange rate makes the Bangladeshi taka more powerful in the international market.",2024-02-28,
Reimagining citizenship: Exploring the intersection of ecofeminism and republicanism through political care and compulsory care service,"As the world was hit by COVID-19, care workers were once again recognized as key workers in society, whose primary responsibility is to ensure the survival and well-being of people. Care work is defined as a set of ""economic activities in the home, market, community, and state that fit loosely under the rubric of human services"" (Folbre, 2006, pp. 11–12). Although care work is frequently performed within households as an unpaid form of labor and is not monetized, the pandemic has revealed a shortage of care supplies and an increasing demand for care. Despite its importance, care work remains one of the lowest-paying occupations in the global capitalist economy. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that women, both in and outside the formal workforce, continue to bear a disproportionate burden of unpaid care work (Chopra & Zambelli, 2017; Güney-Frahm, 2020; Power, 2020). Given these complexities and contradictions, this article aims to contribute to the adequate recognition of such an essential and ineliminable form of work. Feminist scholars and care theorists have attempted to reframe care as an explicitly political idea (Held, 2018; Kittay, 1999; Noddings, 1984; Robinson, 2010; Ruddick, 1980; Sevenhuijsen, 1998; Tronto, 1993). Previous research about care work has commonly been raised from an enduring critique that the notions of public sphere and citizenship have been plagued by a misogynized democracy deficit. The first section characterizes care work as an essential maintenance activity that stems from human vulnerability. Then the second section shows how both vulnerability and care work are ""feminized"" and therefore ""interiorised"" by ""imagined invulnerability,"" a dominant patriarchal mentality, logic, norm, and discipline of liberal capitalism. The third section, however, argues that care should be a collective concern of all citizens, moving it out of the private sphere and into the realm of politics, by interpreting the Arendtian understanding of ""the political"" and ""public life."" Not only is care already a political issue, but it should also be developed as a sense of citizenship, which this article shall call political care. This is achieved by combining ecofeminist philosophy with the republican understanding of politics and power, so that care work is no longer gendered but seen as a universal interest for all citizens in society. To this end, the article proposes an institution of compulsory care service, given its emphasis on both degendering care work and fostering active citizenship. First and foremost, as humans, we are inherently vulnerable beings. Vulnerability is a defining aspect of our existence and is an inseparable part of what it means to be human. It stems from our corporeality and mortality and encompasses our universal susceptibility to hunger, thirst, diseases, disabilities, ill health, and death (Mackenzie et al., 2014, p. 7). Our bodily limitations make us prone to various dangers, harms, and hazards, making ""precarity,"" in Butler's terms, an unavoidable part of the human experience (2004). Vulnerability also marks our bodily existence with dependency, as we all require care and assistance from others at some point in our lives to mitigate risks and live a good life. We can both depend on others when we are in need and provide aid to other vulnerable beings. a species activity that includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our ""world"" so that we can live in it as well as possible. That would include our bodies, ourselves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. (1990, p. 40) The definition of care suggests that giving and receiving care is a collective and public experience, not a one-way or temporary situation. Care is multidimensional and accompanies different temporal and spatial scales throughout our lives. In this way, both vulnerability and care are essential and ineliminable. The connection between vulnerability and care work highlights that vulnerability often motivates us to develop moral obligations, such as the ethics of care, to ensure the well-being and autonomy of those whose lives are interdependent and influenced by the social and ecological environment we all live in. By placing vulnerability at the center of our moral duties and social learning, we can create more politically feasible and justified conditions to achieve social justice, democratic equality, virtuous citizenship, state responsibility and ecological sustainability, which all remind us of ""what we owe to one another as citizens"" (Mackenzie, 2014, p. 36). Another key aspect is that this life-sustaining and repairing activity acknowledges our constitutive dependency on one another and aims to improve the autonomy and well-being of other people. It is a long-standing ecofeminist view that we are dependent not only on other human beings but also on nonhuman beings and the natural world, comprising the web of life. As relational and vulnerable beings, we live in our community by organizing social norms and ethico-political obligations. If we were absolutely independent, there would be no need to fulfill the moral obligation to care for someone in need or reciprocally, to be in need of care and attention from others. Ecofeminist ethics affirm that the ways in which humans relate to the natural world should be ""open-minded and attentive,"" thereby fostering ""an attitude of care and compassion"" (Matthews, 1994, p. 159). That is, vulnerability motivates us to take ethical actions based on ""care and compassion for human and non-human others"" (Barry, 2012, p. 75). To take a further step, ecofeminists employ the notion of ""kinship,"" arguing that the range of family can be extended to our human and nonhuman ""relatives"" (Mathews, 1994, p. 162). Thus, within the planetary community where human and nonhuman relatives are complicatedly networked with one another, each individual can be kind, caring, and loving without the need for their motivations to be justified by the Kantian notion of rationality, believed to enable moral agency (Donovan, 1990, p. 355). Yet, as I will argue in the next section, care and compassion should not be taken for granted or assumed to be inherently positive experiences but should be adequately revalued first, considering the exploitative conditions that often characterize both unpaid and paid care work in the liberal-capitalist world. Vulnerability is not necessarily negative nor always positive, but is rather ""ambivalent"" and open-ended, ""[taking] diverse forms in different social situations"" (Gilson, 2011, p. 310). The recognition that vulnerability is marked by ambivalence is in parallel with ecofeminist endeavor to deconstruct the human/nature dualism, encompassing other subsequent dualisms dividing reason and emotion, men and women, and so forth (Haraway, 2003; Merchant, 1990; Plumwood, 1993; Strathern, 1980). Within this binary framework, dependency, arising from vulnerability, is typically perceived as a negative and feminized (also, in turn, negatively relegated) trait, with human rationality often more closely associated with independence, masculinity, and thus superior. However, ambivalence is a more accurate reflection of the complexities of the real world—more nuanced and varied than the binary classification misunderstands. For example, MacIntyre (1999) argues that human rationality would not have developed if dependency was not a constitutive part of the human condition. All rational claims, whether spoken or written, are made to be recognized and responded to by others in the end, meaning that having an audience is integral in the process of making rational claims. The process of making rational claims begins to exist in the real world through reactions from others however they are positive or negative, and with the potential to harm or benefit us. The audience, once distinct from the speaker, now becomes part of the discourse as soon as they engage in the conversation. Language connects the speaker to the outside world, bridging the divide between speaker and audience. Note that there is nothing inherently superior about language; it is merely one form, just one way of communication. Furthermore, the rational claim made by the speaker is never entirely ""original"" or ""independent,"" as the speaker's knowledge that shapes the claim must have been influenced by their previous learning experience. The process of learning, which precedes speaking, requires acquiring a language to convey knowledge and involves the participation of other beings. Hence, it can be said that we are, to a great extent, entirely dependent on others for learning new knowledge. The speaker is dependent on the audience, as speech alone cannot advance the discourse. The audience also takes on an active role, reacting to the claim and providing feedback when necessary, thereby becoming critics now. Here, we can see that ""listening"" is also associated with ""activity"" and occurs concurrently with ""speaking,"" challenging the dualism of speech (language)/listening and activity/passivity. Dependency now turns into relationality and sociality, by the time the speaker interacts and communicates with the audience. Therefore, rational claims or such speech acts are not entirely separable from dependency and attentiveness; hence the binary between them is now unclear and meaningless. To summarize, dependency enables relationality, sociality, and communication. Put differently, vulnerability leads us to be open and exposed to change, affections (both affected and affecting), encompassing both passivity and activity. That is, as Gilson (2011) suggests, vulnerability is ""a condition of potential that makes possible other conditions"" (p. 310). But vulnerability is neither avoidable nor eliminable; it is simply part of what and who we are. While the inherent vulnerability is a fundamental, constitutive part of the human condition, our reactions to changes and instabilities can differ, and we have the potential to respond to these changes and uncertainties ""possibly in a generative and not destructive way"" (Rushing, 2021, p. 132). However, not everyone is equally vulnerable to social, political, economic, and ecological changes. Thus, we have additional conceptions of vulnerability, such as situational and pathogenic vulnerability. Situational vulnerability refers to a person's temporary or enduring vulnerability that is ""caused or exacerbated by social, political, economic or environmental factors"" (Mackenzie, 2014, p. 39). Often, situational vulnerability is related to pathogenic vulnerability, where existing unjust social norms, policies, and economic systems may even worsen a person's vulnerability and undermine their well-being. For example, natural disasters may bring a multitude of difficulties, from housing shortages to loss of life. Those affected by natural disasters are situationally vulnerable, and this vulnerability can become even more pronounced if the disaster leads to illness or death. That is, situational vulnerability could upheave our inherent vulnerability. As the Hurricane Katrina disaster in the United States shows, ecological disasters often disproportionately affect individuals based on preexisting socioeconomic inequalities (Zoraster, 2010, p. 75). Low income, financial insecurity, insufficient evacuation means, and fragile housing are all ""risk factors"" that stem from structural injustice and contribute to what is known as pathogenic vulnerability. Furthermore, failed social policies that unintentionally exacerbate existing structural injustices also contribute to pathogenic vulnerability by ""[causing or compounding] major capability failure, thereby entrenching social inequality and injustice"" (Mackenzie, 2014, p. 54). In this sense, Mackenzie argues that inherent vulnerability and situational vulnerability are not exactly ""categorical"" but rather have intersecting characteristics that can give rise to new forms of vulnerabilities (2014, p. 39). However, vulnerability is reduced to or exaggerated as an inextricably feminine trait that is seen as a ""problem"" to be ""solved,"" ""eliminated,"" or ""ignored."" On the other hand, invulnerability, an invented ideology, is perpetuated by the powerful who seek to maintain the status quo through hypermasculinity. Hypermasculinity is an important element of invulnerability, because hypermasculine norms and values function as a false guideline showing how to be an ideal or ""real"" man. The hypermasculine ideal can be summarized with three characteristics: (1) sexual aggression as an admirable personality trait; (2) risk-taking as a desirable challenge or an exciting entertainment, such as high-risk investments in the stock market and casual sex with strangers, and, in short, openness to risk-taking as a bold, capable ""manly"" attitude; and (3) violence as an approvable problem-solving behavior (Mosher & Tomkins, 1988, p. 61). These ideals are as old as the ""warrior"" role model for men in the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, in which hypermasculine invulnerability was invented as a ""virtue of being a male"" (Mosher & Tomkins, 1988, p. 64). Most modern societies criminalize some of these hypermasculine behaviors like violent outbursts, and it is far from true that aggressive and uncivil people are in an advantageous position of success in social situations such as the workplace. Yet, patriarchal culture keeps educating boys to behave like a ""real man,"" that is, invulnerable man. On young boys' socialization, ecofeminist thinker Plumwood (1986) suggests that such characteristics ""must kill what is tender, emotional and dependent, and has a need for mastery and control, to be active and transforming with respect to nature"" (p. 129). Quintessential examples include from a common struggle in parenting when the boy is ""too soft and emotional"" to the grown-up man now choosing his career path in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) or entrepreneurship, although there is little evidence explaining masculinity's substantial role in technology-oriented career fields (Gupta et al., 2009, p. 398; Simon et al., 2017). The normativity of hypermasculine invulnerability connects vulnerability to weakness, disadvantages, victimhood, immatureness, premodern (closer to nature), and, because these are all gendered, femininity. For example, when a man becomes disabled due to injury or aging, he immediately loses his ""masculinity"" that was previously assigned to him by society based on his dominant gender status (Vaittinen, 2015, p. 103). When he loses his ""independent"" body, he requires assistance with daily activities, from eating and bathing to running errands. This neediness causes able-bodied individuals to view him as too weak and not masculine enough to exercise his own autonomous will, making him not a ""full"" or ""complete"" citizen of the modern polity. There are numerous examples of the relegation of disabled bodies, for example, the ways in which Korean War veterans were treated so poorly in post-war Korea (Kim, 2012, p. 325). Not only were rehabilitation programs for the veterans absent, but there were also no effective systems for reemployment and education. The disabled veterans were called national heroes, but their bodies had to be hidden from the public sight in the face of reestablishing the ruined state and erasing the nightmare of the war. Likewise, disabled people are historically excluded from the public sphere, which is a political arena for and by ""active"" participants with ""autonomous"" bodies. Following gender dichotomies that categorize politics, publicity, and citizenship as maleness, disabled bodies are associated with weakness, passivity, private (hidden from sight), prepolitical, and interchangeably, femininity, and femaleness. However, there are no significant differences in the intrinsic human conditions embodied by able and disabled bodies, except for the different degrees of care each requires. To put this in Butler's terms, precarity is universal, but it could be ""allocated differentially"" (2004, p. 31). As Vaittinen (2015) summarizes, having to urinate and defecate has nothing to do with determining one's moral disposition, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and so forth. Nevertheless, disabled people who require care assistance are downgraded to the status of inert and passive beings. Hence, we can identify that vulnerability itself is not only denied but also gendered, while the idea of invulnerability, on the other hand, is proliferated as something desirable and necessary to achieve. The bifurcation of vulnerability and invulnerability is a social construction created by patriarchal liberal capitalism. It is a modern creation shaped by Enlightenment thought, which originated from Francis Bacon and Immanuel Kant, and perceives humans as independent, rational, self-centered, and invulnerable individuals (Merchant, 1990). Invulnerability encompasses modern liberal ideals such as self-mastery and rational thinking, which have further evolved into competitive self-interest in the era of neoliberalism. According to this classical and neoliberal logic, homo economicus is believed to be free as long as their economic and other activities are not intervened by external power such as the government. For the government, it is considered virtuous at best not to interfere with the market so that the economy can be ""free."" However, these moral principles are ""imagined"" and false because they overlook our inherent vulnerability and dependency, which I shall call ""imagined invulnerability"" in this article. One key aspect is that the control and mastery (i.e., domination) that is imagined through invulnerability is structural and hegemonic, meaning that it is a cultural hegemony where ""consent and force nearly always coexist."" This means that domination is not always explicitly oppressive, but it is often accepted as a social norm by the majority of the people (Jackson Lears, 1985, p. 568). Although they may seem acceptable in society, the biases produced by imagined invulnerability have detrimental effects, particularly for marginalized groups of human and nonhuman beings, compared to white, wealthy, heterosexual cisgender men. Imagined invulnerability has its roots in the Promethean faith of the Enlightenment era, which celebrates human progress through science, technology, and domination of the natural world (Dryzek, 2005, pp. 52–53). This classical liberal belief claims that nature itself has only ""use values"" and is ""only serviceable to us"" in order to ""[increase] the abundance of production"" and make ""men richer"" (Ricardo, 2001, p. 208). It also believes that any form of natural or social disaster and difficulty can be resolved through modern technology, material prosperity, and economic growth. The invulnerable Promethean belief is now particularly associated with the exacerbating climate crisis, where advanced technologies such as geoengineering are expected to be the solution. Moreover, the imagined invulnerability of the human condition creates a hierarchical ordering between rationality and emotion, the public and private, competition (economic) and altruism (charitable), able-bodied and disabled, and so on (Matthews, 2017, p. 58). As explained in the previous section, this modern dualism is also a gendered device, meaning that invulnerable characteristics are supriorized and attributed to men, while subjects and values associated with vulnerability are inferiorized and considered feminine, as seen in the example of the disabled body (see Table 1). The ecofeminist notion of intersectionality also explains that this gendered division is consolidated in other sites of struggle where power dynamics are oppressive and unjust to marginalized subjects, such as non-Western countries and the people, nonhuman beings, and nature, in comparison to the West, humans, and culture (Davion, 2001; Griffin, 1999; Perkins et al., 2005; Tickner, 1993). To summarize, the false belief in human invulnerability and the resulting hierarchical ordering between invulnerability and vulnerability are at the heart of ""masculine"" domination over women and nature. This reason/emotion dualism is then extended to the culture/nature (as well as civilization/barbarity, often found in the justification of colonialism) dualism, which embodies a fundamental mentality of human and nonhuman dichotomy. Dichotomies are not harmful in and of themselves, but they become toxic as soon as they develop hierarchical orderings that potentially create tyrannical power relations. Consequently, reason, culture, individual autonomy, masculinity, and growth-oriented economy are seen as vastly superior to emotion, nature, the common good, femininity, and coordinating communitarian economies in liberal conscience. Within this dualistic liberal worldview, care work is wrongly seen as inherently feminine work. Moreover, the public value of care work has also been denied or misconstrued and considered private rather than public action. The division of the public and private spheres is structurally more beneficial to some groups, namely, privileged and able-bodied citizens who are exempt from ""privatized"" care work. These privileged groups and individuals are exempt from care work due to their socioeconomic status based on gender, racial and ethnic identity, or class (Ahn, 2012; Song, 2013). It represents a form of ""privileged irresponsibility,"" which operates to seek their own needs and achieve their personal autonomy, independence, and imagined invulnerability. This is further normalized by the neoliberal market mechanism in which care services, such as childcare, health care, education, and eldercare, are financialized and commercialized and can only be purchased by those who can afford them, making care a commodity (Ungerson, 1997). For those who cannot afford this neoliberal procurement of care services, care work is reduced to be delivered within the family, with women more likely to bear the burden of this unpaid work. Migrant women, who may work in care as a profession, may not even have formal eligibility, such as the right to vote, and thus cannot take part in decision-making in the society they live in. This highlights the absurdity that our care responsibilities are outsourced even to noncitizens. Furthermore, paid care labor is mostly carried out by low-paid women, in many cases from financially deprived and/or non-Western/white backgrounds. This racialized ""global care chain"" has created another form of domination over these women hired by upper-middle-class parents and couples who are often located in the Global North (Oksala, 2018, p. 226). Oksala pinpoints ethical problems in outsourcing care responsibility to a third party, suggesting that the social benefits of rearing and caring for children would be disproportionately distributed only to particular people. Paid workers provide skilled labor and taxes to their employers and pensioners, respectively. However, the employers and pensioners are the people who had little to do with care work when the workers were children. By contrast, unpaid and paid care workers, who consequently contribute the most economic value that the workers create, are not even appreciated adequately by market capitalism (Dengler & Strunk, 2018, p. 167). In this sense, White points out that ""care has evolved as a set of professional rather than political practices"" (2010, p. 4). Care is doubly ""privatized,"" first confined to households and then incorporated into the formal, private economy, and also transformed into a ""commodity"" to be bought and sold. Care has also become negotiable not through democratic deliberation in politics but through monetary relations and negotiations in the market. The commercialization of care labor also brings more complexities. On the one hand, it is difficult to assign a financial value to the quality of care, and care is often mistakenly viewed as an altruistic and feminine expression of love and sacrifice. On the other hand, care is crucial for human survival and general well-being. These complexities and the downplaying of care work result in poor pay for care workers in the commercialized realm (Folbre, 2001). This segregation not only divides people based on gendered divisions of labor but also according to their financial capabilities, creating a divide between relatively financially disadvantaged care providers and upper-middle-class consumers, as well as perpetuating racial injustice. Feminist scholars have critiqued this sharp split, as well as the public experiences within agonistic politics, for its underlying presumption of white, bourgeois, able-bodied male experiences (Benhabib, 1993, p. 103). According to Benhabib, agonistic public deliberation is exclusive as it is ""based on competition"" where one's ""preeminence"" and ""heroism"" are emphasized over collaboration, coordination, or concert (1993, p. 102). Able-bodied (because they are not too old or injured yet) people are expected to exhibit the norm of invulnerability and take the role of ""merciful"" or ""beneficial"" helpers, producers/workers, and decision-makers (MacIntyre, 1999, p. 2). They are expected to be ""active,"" ""healthy,"" and ""autonomous,"" thereby justifying their existence as ""normal"" and entitled to participate in agonistic competition in politics. In short, the agonistic public sphere is optimized for the political participation of homo economicus (see Engster, 2022). In this regard, agonal politics marginalizes those with greater care burden, predominantly women, as they have limited temporal and spatial accessibility to the public sphere. Care receivers, such as disabled men, are also removed from public sight, limiting politics to a space for invulnerable and masculine citizens. This means that care issues are less likely to be prioritized on the public agenda and effectively depoliticized (Armstrong & Armstrong, 2005, p. 169). However, not only has care as a public spirit been underrepresented in Western political thoughts, but care work has also been excluded from the political agenda-setting process due to its symbolic association with private interests and family affairs (which are also privatized), despite its clear primacy, publicity, and collectiveness that, again, affects all of us. The crucial point is that women and other ""vulnerable"" individuals, who are seen as ""feminine"" or ""emotional"" and therefore not capable of fitting the model of a rational and unemotional public citizen, often thriving in the market too, are excluded from the notion of citizenship. They are disconnected from the ""invulnerable"" understanding of citizenship because of their vulnerability, whereas invulnerable, able-bodied, masculine public citizens are seen as the embodiment of citizenship. [the] polis … is not the city-state in its physical location; it is the organization of the people as it arises out of acting and speaking together, and its true space lies between people living together for this purpose, no matter where they happen to be. (p. 198) One may critique Arendt on the ground that her notion of politics as performance contributes to privileging publicity over the ""private"" sphere, and thus, in this understanding of ""politics,"" care work remains undervalued, as it is not within the sphere of ""politics"" (Benhabib, 1993, p. 105). However, it is questionable if such criticisms also derive from this misunderstanding based on the public/private and paid/unpaid labor dichotomy. Sandilands also suggests that the polis is an ambivalent, unpredictable place that ""[lacks] … a firm foundation"" (1999, pp. 160–161). Reinterpreting Arendt, we can see the political discussion has no ""inevitable barring of the private"" nor ""priori definition"" of its content (Sandilands, 1999, p. 161). In other words, the political is not confined to a set boundary with a fixed content, but rather it is an enduring, fluid, and never-ending process that is conversation-dependent at all levels. Its uncertainty and unpredictability are inherent to the nature of politics in public life, as it is an artifact of vulnerable human beings who are susceptible to both corruption and the thriving of social and ecological communities. The concepts of uncertainty and unpredictability bring a deeper consideration of republicanism into the discussion. Republicans view politics as being subject to change and stability, which is critical to the success of a republic (Cannavò, 2010, p. 369). Public spiritedness is a driving force behind both transforming a corrupt republic into a flourishing one and maintaining a just republic to prevent corruption. Here, change and stability are not dichotomously separated. It is important to note that the prosperity of a strong republic does not override timelessness, meaning that its prosperity does not guarantee its permanence. Engagement from citizens who prioritize the common good is essential for the flourishing of both social and political communities. This is because participation as a process of democratic politics shapes the dynamics of change and stability. On the other hand, when a republic loses its dynamism, it becomes more vulnerable to corruption. Thus, ""preventing the unsustainability of the republic is central to republicanism"" (Barry, 2012, p. 227, original emphasis). On this grounded republican notion of public spiritedness, green republicanism—a particular strand of republicanism—emphasizes the importance of ""willingness to sacrifice"" in changing or stabilizing politics aimed at human flourishing (Cannavò, 2010, p. 369). As referring to communitarian or participatory politics, sacrifice as a civic virtue is better understood as a reciprocal and co-beneficial caring relationship. This new social norm of mutual caring would create a continuous, timeless, and patterned virtuous c",2024-02-28,
The Warehousing System and the Great Qan’s Financial Geography in the Mongol Empire,"This study explores when and how the warehousing system 倉庫制 in the Mongol Empire (1206~1370) had been established, developed, and administered. The warehouse, as an administrative service to accumulate and redistribute treasures, shows the relationship between the procurement of imperial materials and the circulation of commodities as well as the great Qan’s financial geography. The study examines the way in which the Mongol Emperor of Qa’an procured and controlled materials and treasures, and therefore to characterize the Mongol’s development of its own, especially in the fiscal finance.&#x0D; The first Mongol warehouses, balaqat in Mongol, were set up by Ögödei Qa’an in Mongolia in 1229. They consist of grain-houses (倉 cang in Chinese, anbār in Persian) and treasuries (庫 ku in Chinese, khazāna in Persian). Since Qubilai Qa’an sat on the throne in 1260, warehouses were increasingly built up. The number of grain-houses increased with the consolidation of the Southern Song in 1279. While land taxes 稅糧 traveled from Jiangnan provinces on the sea route to a capital city of Dadu 大都, the main base of grain supply was moved from Qiansicang 千斯倉 in the northeast to Wansinancang 萬斯南倉 in the south. Four Imperial Treasuries of Trillion 萬億四庫 beside Jishuitan 積水潭 storing valuables such as paper money, jade wares and others, served as the leading treasuries of the Empire.&#x0D; The warehouses were located along the middle and lower part of the Yellow River, the streams in Jianghui 江淮, as well as next to the canal in Huabei 華北 area. Geopolitically speaking, they mostly belonged to the central domain of Fuli 腹裏 (qol-un ulus in Mongol), supervised by the Central Secretariat 中書省. The fact that Large grain-houses and state treasuries were intensively stationed in the capital cities of Qara Qorum 和林, Dadu and Shangdu 上都, and their vicinities demonstrates their relevance to the Qa’an’s seasonal journey sites. The Qa’an stood in the center of collection, control, and consumption of imperial materials and treasures.&#x0D; In staffing, warehouse officials 倉庫官 (khazāna-chī in Persian) were originated from balaqači 八剌哈赤 and sangči 倉赤 in Mongol respectively. They came from keshig 怯薛, the Mongol imperial guards. Balaqači was appointed as a treasury official 庫官 or a gatekeeper general 封門官員, and sangči as an official of treasuries or grain-houses by the Qa’an in person to the warehouses in Dadu and nearby. This is called belge selection 別里哥選, or imperial appointment 宣授.&#x0D; The expansion of warehouses caused shortage of staffing in the Mongols. Considering staff’s personality and richness, the Yüan Dynasty appointed officials such as directors of collection 監納 or commissioners 大使 among Central Asians 色目人 and Chinese 漢人 through the selection process of the Secretarial or Presidential Councils 尙書省, called general selection 常選, or imperial decree appointment 勅授. And Bureau clerks 司吏 with richness, working career, governmental salaries, and mature age could be advanced to lower staffs in charge, or deputies 副使 in district warehouses 各路倉庫.&#x0D; Warehouse officials from the Mongols, Central Asians and Chinese show a ratio of 1 to 3 to 6. While more Mongols and Central Asians worked in Qara Qorum, the Chinese staffing grew larger particularly in grain-houses as time went by to the late period of the Empire.",2024-02-28,
Bitcoin vs Gold: Techno Legal Aspects of Global Market Implications,"A decade-old innovation, cryptographic currency facilitates sophisticated transactions over an encoded distributed network. Bitcoin, the initial and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, is driving the development of secure and immutable financial payment systems as a challenging innovation. Although digital currencies are unlikely to replace traditional government-issued money, they may have an impact on how global online marketplaces interact with one another by removing the constraints associated with traditional public currency forms and exchange rates.

"Oil revenues, FDI and balance of payment dynamics: The case of Kazakhstan between the supercycle commodity boom and financial subordination","Alongside an increased privatization and liberalization process, since 1995 the economy of Kazakhstan experienced a golden period of growth. Together with macroeconomic stability, the country attracted enormous resources from the rest of the world through financial account, mainly in terms of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the oil sector. We show how, thanks to the 2003–2014 supercycle oil and commodity boom, Kazakhstan was able to count on an extraordinary level of goods and trade balance but, despite that, registered almost persistent current account deficits that reinforced its need for financial inflows. Our work investigates the sustainability of Kazakhstan's development strategy based on primary goods export, fossil fuel in particular, and on external financial inflow reliance through the study of its balance of payments, its international investment position statistics and through the ownership of Kazakhstan's main resources. The study of Kazakhstan's current economic and geopolitical opportunities and risks is particularly relevant since the country finds itself at the heart of a complex game of pressure and equilibriums exactly among the major economic (and military) superpowers as China, Russia, the United States and Europe.",2024-02-27,
Financial regulatory arbitrage and the financialization of commodities,"Abstract We explore the effects of financial regulatory arbitrage on commodity pricing. We examine two types of financial arbitrage: capital‐control arbitrage , in which commodities are imported to circumvent capital controls and profit from disparities in interest rates between domestic and international markets, and dual‐track interest‐rate arbitrage , in which commodities are utilized as collateral to capitalize on domestic dual‐track interest‐rate spreads. Our findings demonstrate that both forms of arbitrage positively affect commodity price returns. However, they affect the inverse relationship between inventory and convenience yield differently. While capital‐control arbitrage can either amplify or weaken this relationship, dual‐track arbitrage makes it less negative.",2024-02-25,

Private equity's plot against older Americans,"Over the past several decades more than 140 private equity investment firms,1 have acquired entities in major components of healthcare in the United States. Private Equity funds are specialized for profit investment vehicles that attract capital from very wealthy individuals, banks, pension funds or other organizations with large financial resources. Private Equity firms promise struggling medical groups ""financial engineering"" to increase profits, an access to cash, organization of back office efficiencies, and general management expertise. Since they are ""private"" they have great latitude in conducting business and their major strategies actually primarily involve cutting costs and patient care along with self-enriching business strategies as described below. They use their massive financial resources to acquire broad sections of most of the major components of healthcare in the United States. Their subsequent business plans are financial genius but unmitigated disasters for patients. Private Equity firms have undertaken acquisitions of financially or administratively distressed hospitals, nursing homes, physician practices especially emergency care and medical specialties, hospices, home care agencies, physical therapy and rehabilitation operations, ambulance services, and nursing registries. They promise ""financial engineering"" miracles to restore profitability. While some"" back-office"" efficiencies do generally occur most of their activities are draconian cost and care-cutting plans along with business actions such as leveraged buy-outs, paying themselves large management fees with bonuses, and using the organization's own resources to take out huge debts. Of particular importance for older Americans, Private Equity firms currently own a significant percentage of U.S. nursing homes; estimates range from 5% to 11%, and a rapidly increasing percentage of hospice and home care agencies.2 All three are important sources of seniors' care. Why should we be concerned about these issues considering all of the other current challenges to the medical system? First, simply because of Private Equities well-documented history of consistently turning a profit by reducing care, while cutting costs and raising prices. These strategies have already impaired care for the unprotected and vulnerable users of these and other care services3, 4 and threaten more harm with the passage of time. Second, while any of us may become a user of these providers; these sources of care are primarily accessed by senior Americans on Medicare with illnesses that require affordable, timely, safe, high-quality expert help, and support from these three professional entities and disciplines. Finally, Private Equity activities divert tax payer and Medicare dollars into their profits instead of improving care. To understand the basis of these major threats it must be appreciated that Private Equity has as its routinely achieved overriding principle goal and priority, that all of their healthcare business acquisitions must generally provide a 20% annual return to their new owners and investors. Patients and their illnesses are simply commodities to be managed as efficiently and as least expensively as possible. The provision of quality care is no longer looked upon as a societal good or important goal.1, 2 Cost cutting is the order of the day, improved health outcomes are not a concern of private equity owners.3 Private equity is notoriously adept at working the system to their advantage. Examples of specific money-saving strategies and tactics include3-6; reducing the number of patient visits by hospice and home care workers, reducing the number of employees in hospitals and nursing homes, while increasing productivity quotas for those who remain. Hiring less skilled care providers is also a common private equity staffing move.3 Routine denials for diagnostic or therapeutic interventions at the front end of care are practiced for cost-cutting purposes. Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that even as these destructive moves are taking place prices are raised,2, 3 especially when local market dominance is achieved. As a result of these ""business"" decisions multiple peer-reviewed research studies demonstrate significant declines in the levels of patient care, too often with increases in morbidity and mortality.3-6 At the same time, the Private Equity group is using the above financial strategies plus lucrative leasebacks, and uncalled for bonuses and management fees and favorable Mergers and Acquisitions. A final strategy is a sale to another Private Equity entity, usually after five years. All these strategies and tactics work effectively to enhance their profit margins.1 A related issue of special interest to physicians and other health professionals is what happens to Private Equity employees if and when their owner folds and declares bankruptcy? Not a theoretical question since the two biggest PE physician employers, who cover forty percent of employed physicians7; Envision Health Care with 7.7 billion dollars in debt, and Team Health with 5 billion dollars in debt have recently filed for bankruptcy re-organization relief.8 Further, American Physician Partners (APP), which previously provided E. R. staffing for 150 U.S. hospitals, had ""only""472 million in debt but could not find a buyer so simply went out of business as of August 1, 2023, by declaring liquidation bankruptcy.8 This left 2500 physicians and other providers without several months of back pay and even worse, no malpractice tail coverage! The solutions to control this rapidly growing healthcare disaster will require serious federal and local government and health department oversight. New legislation and regulations could enforce quality and safety standards of staffing and care some of which have already been proposed,10 as well as legal interventions1, 2 to prevent PE's current multiple, outrageous, unregulated financial and care abuses, outright neglect and questionable illegal behaviors. Such changes, particularly welcome if accompanied by a complete revision of our non-system of healthcare delivery, are finally starting to be talked about in Congress2, 9, 10 and by President Biden. This would vastly improve care and could save billions of Medicare dollars annually.3 However, even when and if adopted such changes will be slow to be implemented. In the meantime, physicians as well as families, governments, patient advocacy groups, and patients should be aware of these Private Equity issues. All participants should use due diligence options to thoroughly investigate the ownership and provision of care for any of these organizations that are providing healthcare services for patients, themselves or relatives. Regular follow-up monitoring to assure that promises to government agencies, families, and health professionals are fulfilled will be crucial. James Webster is the sole author of this article.

ENHANCING AGRICULTURAL RESILIENCE: EXPLORING THE ROLE OF INSURANCE AND RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES IN SUSTAINABLE FARMING,"This book chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the landscape of agricultural insurance in India, tracing its historical evolution from traditional schemes to contemporary initiatives. The analysis begins with an exploration of the limitations of popular insurance schemes like the National Agricultural Crop Insurance Scheme (NAIS) and the Modified NAIS (MNAIS), highlighting the increased base risk and indemnity payment challenges faced by farmers. The chapter then delineates the spectrum of agricultural risks, spanning production, market, institutional, personal, and financial domains, elucidating their impact on the sustainability and profitability of farming operations. Moving beyond risk identification, various types of agricultural insurance, such as yield-based, revenue-based, livestock, weather-based, and index-based insurance. The eligibility criteria for crop insurance are underscored, particularly for farmers relying on loans from rural finance institutions. The second part of the chapter concentrates on practical risk mitigation strategies, both on and off the farm. On-farm strategies include crop diversification, irrigation and water management, integrated pest management, and precision agriculture technologies. Simultaneously, off-farm strategies encompass financial instruments like futures and options contracts, forward contracts, hedging, and commodity exchanges. The chapter concludes with a spotlight on the pivotal role of government initiatives, outlining public agricultural insurance programs, subsidies, and multifaceted support mechanisms designed to fortify farmers against adversities. The discussion underscores the need for a holistic approach, amalgamating on-farm practices, financial instruments, and governmental support to fortify the agricultural sector's resilience and sustainability for the future.",2024-02-23,
"Enhancing Mean-Reverting Time Series Prediction with Gaussian Processes:
  Functional and Augmented Data Structures in Financial Forecasting","In this paper, we explore the application of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for predicting mean-reverting time series with an underlying structure, using relatively unexplored functional and augmented data structures. While many conventional forecasting methods concentrate on the short-term dynamics of time series data, GPs offer the potential to forecast not just the average prediction but the entire probability distribution over a future trajectory. This is particularly beneficial in financial contexts, where accurate predictions alone may not suffice if incorrect volatility assessments lead to capital losses. Moreover, in trade selection, GPs allow for the forecasting of multiple Sharpe ratios adjusted for transaction costs, aiding in decision-making. The functional data representation utilized in this study enables longer-term predictions by leveraging information from previous years, even as the forecast moves away from the current year's training data. Additionally, the augmented representation enriches the training set by incorporating multiple targets for future points in time, facilitating long-term predictions. Our implementation closely aligns with the methodology outlined in, which assessed effectiveness on commodity futures. However, our testing methodology differs. Instead of real data, we employ simulated data with similar characteristics. We construct a testing environment to evaluate both data representations and models under conditions of increasing noise, fat tails, and inappropriate kernels-conditions commonly encountered in practice. By simulating data, we can compare our forecast distribution over time against a full simulation of the actual distribution of our test set, thereby reducing the inherent uncertainty in testing time series models on real data. We enable feature prediction through augmentation and employ sub-sampling to ensure the feasibility of GPs.",2024-02-23,

<scp>TRANSFORMING SOCIAL HOUSING INTO AN ASSET CLASS</scp>: <scp>REITs</scp> and the Financialization of Supported Housing in England,"Abstract This article explores the governance of risk in financialization through the entry of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and other investment funds into specialized supported housing in England. Supported housing is a form of care accommodation intended to enable vulnerable groups such as people with learning disabilities to live more independently. Since 2014, investors have targeted the sector, developing a leaseback model that has encountered controversy due to unsustainable rents and the near bankruptcy of at least one housing association. The article unpacks these dynamics by asking how financialization has generated risk through the imposition of a ‘care fix’ in the sector, drawing on qualitative data including interviews, financial and media reports, and court and regulatory documents. In answering this question, it argues that the contradiction between housing's role as a private commodity and as a collective means of social reproduction generates tensions that suggest potential limits to financialization.",2024-02-21,
Concepções de adolescentes escolares sobre o consumo de álcool: pesquisa-ação,"Alcohol is the most consumed psychoactive substance worldwide by adolescents.This scenario is considered a serious public health problem due to the consequences that alcohol abuse generates for the individual, his family and society.Considering the social and scientific relevance of this theme, it is important to obtain a greater understanding of this behavior and due to its complexity, this work is anchored in the Theory of Everyday Representations and in the foundations of Collective Health.The objective of this study is to analyze the conceptions of adolescent students about alcohol consumption.This is a qualitative research, of the emancipatory action-research type.It was developed in a public high school institution.The study participants are 1st year old adolescents aged between 15 and 17 years.Data collection took place through twenty groups, with an average of twelve participants per group.The groups were audio-recorded and filmed on a digital device and transcribed.The Atlas.Ti software was used to assist in the separation of discourses and categorization of data.Participant observation and field diary were used as complementary techniques.Data analysis was performed using the thematic modality -content analysis technique.The results reveal that the discourses of adolescent students are mostly simplified and naturalized representations in society with ideological influence, in which the subjects reflect on having the awareness to consume and disapprove of excessive drinking and losing control.They also talk about strategies to reduce harm to themselves and others, such as not driving after having ingested alcohol, as well as discussing water intake during alcohol and food consumption.There was a predominance of discourses that refer to the financial difficulty experienced by adolescents and their families, parents' expenses with alcoholic beverages, the parents' demand for responsibility for them to look for a job, the feeling of feeling charged and distressed in the face of the lack of income, the difficulty in reconciling school with work and the moment that work harms the school, and sometimes leading them to drop out of school.These factors have an impact on the mental health of adolescents and are also related to the consumption of alcohol, which is encouraged by society as a necessary commodity for pain and stress relief and the possibility of momentary joy.We consider that the construction of spaces for conversations and discussions can become an important social and health technology, with a view to mobilizing them for debates and reflections on topics of collective interest and that impact people's lives to overcome ideological discourses that involve alcohol consumption, also considering the inequalities of reproduction of social classes.Thus, the currently implemented health education strategies for adolescents should be rethought, as the behavior of drinking alcohol is complex and should not be seen only as an individual decision.",2024-02-20,

Causality Analysis between ESG Performance and Financing Support,"Recent global trends in electric vehicles (EV) triggered Indonesia to participate in battery industry development. Rich in geological resources, the government promotes various capital-intensive industries that process raw mining commodities, particularly limonite nickel ore, to support the EV industry in Indonesia. Inarguably, financial support is needed from various financial institutions and investors. On the contrary, the mining industry is closely related to environmental issues that attract the attention of financial institutions and investors. Therefore, understanding the relationship between “sustainability” and “financing activity” is essential, as it may not only practically guide the business to re-examine their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives but also extend the literature review on these matters. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the system through the Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) formed by ESG factors related to the financing process in mining companies in Indonesia. The research method used in this paper is developing causal loop diagrams from primary data and literature reviews. The CLD is constructed through a literature review and confirmed by an expert from the mining company. The result explains the causal loop between sustainability and financing. Improving ESG performance will increase financial support from global investors and financial institutions. To support practice and concept sustainability in Indonesia, the government should encourage mining companies to increase local partnerships and CSR Allocation as it will support the company's financing activity and trigger community improvement. Creating a supporting environment to attract global investors to finance the mining company in Indonesia is also necessary.

Comment on “Flexible Inflation Targeting and Macroeconomic Performance: Evidence from <scp>ASEAN</scp>”,"Nookhwun and Waiyawatjakorn (2024) represent the first systematic empirical assessment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) inflation targeting frameworks. Specifically, Nookhwun and Waiyawatjakorn examine the role of ASEAN countries' inflation targeting frameworks in reducing inflation levels and volatility, stabilizing economic growth, and maintaining a robust financial system. Nookhwun and Waiyawatjakorn conclude that the frameworks primarily aid in reducing inflation levels. Yet, they also highlight that ASEAN nations, grappling with capital flow volatility and domestic financial imbalances, have evolved their monetary frameworks to integrate diverse policy instruments like foreign exchange interventions, macroprudential policies, and capital flow measures. Despite its brevity and clarity, Nookhwun and Waiyawatjakorn (2024) could be enhanced by briefly discussing various complementary policies and public perceptions of inflation. My first comment relates to complementary policies, in particular, fiscal policy. In addition to the inflation targeting framework, Nookhwun and Waiyawatjakorn note that ASEAN countries also use energy subsidies, price control, and other methods to address short-term global commodity market shocks and inflation. However, they fail to discuss fiscal policy's role in stabilizing economic growth during major crises like the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The surge in public debt in many ASEAN countries, due to unprecedented government spending, underscores fiscal policy's significance in economic stability during economic shocks. Future research should address the interaction between fiscal and monetary policies. My second comment relates to inflation expectations and the public's understanding of inflation targeting. The success of inflation targeting is contingent upon the public's expectations being anchored within the bounds set by central banks. Nookhwun and Waiyawatjakorn utilize professional forecasters' short- and medium-term expectations based on Consensus Economics to illustrate that inflation expectations are well-aligned with central banks' targets, implying that the inflation targets announced by central banks have been credible. However, they overlook the potential limitations in this approach, given the lack of a robust theory on the formation of inflation expectations. In fact, there is a notable gap between the theoretical role of monetary policy in controlling inflation and the corresponding public understanding of this policy. For example, a Bank of Thailand study (Apaitan & Tantasith, 2019) revealed a common misconception among the media that associated inflation control more with price regulation entities (such as the Ministry of Commerce) than with the central bank. This raises questions about the efficacy of inflation targeting in anchoring inflation expectations as the public remains largely unaware of it. In conclusion, while inflation targeting appears to foster better macroeconomic outcomes in ASEAN countries, the role of complementary policies and effective communication is equally crucial. As Nookhwun and Waiyawatjakorn suggest, further research into these policies and their interaction with monetary policy is essential. This requires an investigation into each country's unique policy context and its central bank's communication strategy.",2024-02-18,
Features of different asset types and extreme risk transmission during the COVID-19 crisis,"Abstract Unlike the current extensive literature, which discusses which assets can avoid the risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examines whether the characteristics of different assets affect the extreme risk transmission of the COVID-19 crisis. This study explores the effects of COVID-19 pandemic–related risk factors (i.e., pandemic severity, pandemic regulations and policies, and vaccination-related variables) on the risk of extreme volatility in asset returns across eight assets. These eight assets belong to the following classes: virtual, financial, energy, commodities, and real assets. To consider the different possible aspects of the COVID-19 impact, this study adopts both empirical methods separately, considering variables related to the pandemic as exogenous shocks and endogenous factors. Using these methods, this study enabled a systematic analysis of the relationship between the features of different asset types and the effects of extreme risk transmission during the COVID-19 crisis. The results show that different types of asset markets are affected by different risk factors. Virtual and commodity assets do not exhibit extreme volatility induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The energy market, including crude oil, is most affected by the negative impact of the severity of the pandemic, which is unfavorable for investment at the beginning of the pandemic. However, after vaccinations and pandemic regulations controlled the spread of infection, the recovery of the energy market made it more conducive to investment. In addition, this study explains the differences between the hedging characteristics of Bitcoin and gold. The findings of this study can help investors choose asset types systematically when faced with different shocks.",2024-02-17,
Nexus between financialization of agricultural products and food security amid financial crisis: empirical insights from BRICS,"Purpose The study endeavors to explore whether the financialization of agricultural commodities, traditionally viewed as a catalyst for price volatility, has any repercussions on food security in BRICS economies. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis employs the examination of three agricultural commodities, namely wheat, maize and soybean. Utilizing data from the Chicago Board of Trade on futures trading for these commodities, we focus on parameters such as annual trading volume, annual open interest contracts and the ratio of annual trading volume to annual open interest contracts. The study spans the period 2000–2021, encompassing pre- and post-financial crisis analyses and specifically explores the BRICS countries namely the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. To scrutinize the connections between financialization indicators and food security measures, the analysis employs econometric techniques such as panel data regression analysis and a moderating effects model. Findings The results indicate that the financialization of agricultural products contributes to the heightened food price volatility and has adverse effects on food security in emerging economies. Furthermore, the study reveals that the impact of the financialization of agricultural commodities on food security was more pronounced in emerging nations after the global financial crisis of 2008 compared to the pre-crisis period. Research limitations/implications This paper seeks to draw increased attention to the financialization of agricultural commodities by presenting empirical evidence of its potential impact on food security in BRICS economies. The findings serve as a valuable guide for policymakers, offering insights to help them safeguard the security and availability of the world’s food supply. Originality/value Very few studies have explored the effect of financialization of agricultural commodities on food security covering a sample of developing economies, with sample period from 2000 to 2021, especially at the individual agriculture commodity level. Understanding the evolving effects of financialization is further improved by comparing pre and post-financial crisis times.",2024-02-16,
Significance and perspectives for development of commodity exchange trade in agricultural products,"Exchanges are intermediaries in the trade of commodities, financial instruments that have commodities in their base or credit instruments that are secured by commodities. Commodity exchanges have gained in importance in recent decades. Commodity exchanges have evolved from the place where the physical purchase and sale of goods takes place to trade in commodity derivatives where standardized contracts−futures and options−are traded. The role of commodity exchanges in the development of the agribusiness sector has changed significantly from the initial stage of development when in the beginning the main role was to ensure efficient and transparent exchange of commodities, until the early 1970s when instruments were developed to enable risk management in the agribusiness sector. The largest volume of tradе on modern commodity exchanges is realized in standardized derivative contracts. Financial derivatives are one of the most successful financial innovations, with the volume of turnover increasing significantly. Within this chapter, special attention is paid to the analysis of the situation in the field of commodity exchange trading in the Western Balkan region. According to the results of the analysis, developed agricultural commodity exchange trade is not available to the farmers in these countries, nor are business risk management instruments available to participants in countries with developed commodity exchange systems. Analyses have shown that the sole commodity exchange with a significant volume of trade in the countries of the Western Balkans is the Novi Sad commodity exchange, trading on the spot and non‒standardized term market. In terms of the directions of development of regional commodity trade, the experience so far shows that high trading volume is a paramount for well‒developed commodity exchange. Therefore, the path to the development of commodity exchange trading is the establishment of a regional commodity exchange that would be a place of trade for all of the Western Balkan’s countries. By establishing a regional commodity exchange, participants in the agricultural sector would have the opportunity to securely and transparently trade and manage the price risk that have a pronounced volatility in recent years.",2024-02-16,
"The dynamic volatility nexus of geo-political risks, stocks, bond, bitcoin, gold and oil during COVID-19 and Russian-Ukraine war","We investigate the dynamic volatility connectedness of geopolitical risk, stocks, bonds, bitcoin, gold, and oil from January 2018 to April 2022 in this study. We look at connectivity during the Pre-COVID, COVID, and Russian-Ukraine war subsamples. During the COVID-19 and Russian-Ukraine war periods, we find that conventional, Islamic, and sustainable stock indices are net volatility transmitters, whereas gold, US bonds, GPR, oil, and bitcoin are net volatility receivers. During the Russian-Ukraine war, the commodity index (DJCI) shifted from being a net recipient of volatility to a net transmitter of volatility. Furthermore, we discover that bilateral intercorrelations are strong within stock indices (DJWI, DJIM, and DJSI) but weak across all other financial assets. Our study has important implications for policymakers, regulators, investors, and financial market participants who want to improve their existing strategies for avoiding financial losses.",2024-02-15,
Multifractal Detrended Cross-Correlations between Green Bonds and Commodity Markets: An Exploration of the Complex Connections between Green Finance and Commodities from the Econophysics Perspective,"Green bonds represent a compelling financial innovation that presents a financial perspective solution to address climate change and promote sustainable development. On the other hand, the recent process of financialisation of commodities disrupts the dynamics of the commodity market, increasing its correlation with financial markets and raising the risks associated with commodities. In this context, understanding the dynamics of the interconnectivity between green bonds and commodity markets is crucial for risk management and portfolio diversification. This study aims to reveal the multifractal cross-correlations between green bonds and commodities by employing methods from statistical physics. We apply multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MFDCCA) to both return and volatility series, demonstrating that green bonds and commodities exhibit multifractal characteristics. The analysis reveals long-range power-law cross-correlations between these two markets. Specifically, volatility cross-correlations persist across various fluctuations, while return series display persistence in small fluctuations and antipersistence in large fluctuations. These findings carry significant practical implications for hedging and risk diversification purposes.",2024-02-15,
Eight Dimensions of Land Grabbing That Every Researcher Should Consider,"This chapter describes eight dimensions of land grabbing that every researcher should consider. Researchers need to take more into account the presence of history in the spaces where land grabbing occurs; the complicated scale issues; the impact of commodity prices on and the complexity of land grabbing drivers and the ways in which they have changed in recent years; the underreported role of national actors; the variety of reactions of subaltern groups apart from frontal resistance; and the obscure financial relationships behind large land transactions. There is also a need to restrain agro-centrism and integrate the study of agricultural holdings with other varieties of land grabbing. Moreover, the invisible people on the land, past and present, need to be made visible and to be recognized as justifications and inspiration for mobilizations against land grabbing. Finally, the aspects of gender and especially of generation have been neglected and deserve more analysis, not so much because of a desire to foreground different principles of identity but rather because they are dynamics that in many cases manifestly affect the outcomes of struggles for land.",2024-02-15,
“The coaches always make the health decisions”: Conflict of interest as exploitation in power five college football,"Much research exists on conflict of interest in high-performance sport in the global North. Yet, the research conducted particularly into US college football—a fairly unique social site of athletic labor given that the fact that enormous revenue is produced by professionalized work that is not compensated—is largely quantitative in nature. In this study, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with twenty-five former power five football players Based on our conversations with former college football players in order to interrogate in a more granular way how and why conflict of interest undermines health and safety in the sport. We found that the well-being of college football players is consistently jeopardized because of the financial imperatives that shape the sport and compromise the care players receive from medical practitioners beholden to the team's 'need' to win at all costs. In addition to the inherent concerns this raises about the state of medicine in college athletics, we would also contend that the experiences of the players we spoke to offer a crucial intervention into the debate over 'exploitation' in college sport. While exploitation is generally understood in economic terms based on the question of how and to whom the value produced through the commodity spectacle of college sport is distributed, we contend that it should also be understood in terms of the attendant harms. The testimony in this article contributes to the literature on conflict of interest principally by providing some of the most rich and evocative available testimony about how and why conflict of interest occurs and what the implications are for the players whose care is compromised by it.",2024-02-14,
The Limits of Interest: Moral economy and public engagement in the regulation of derivatives in the United States,"Abstract This article analyzes the public comments submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), 2010–2014, in response to proposed rules for implementing the Dodd‐Frank reforms. By addressing a fine‐grained typology of commenting organizations to a topic model of the combined comments, we illuminate a new pattern of public engagement in financial regulation. Contrary to the economic concept of regulatory capture, our data show no sharp divide between the suppliers of complex derivatives (the dealer banks) and their customers in other parts of the finance industry. In keeping with the general concept of financialization—but contrary to its strongest versions—our data show distinctly delimited evidence of a convergence between the banks and other sectors. Instead of either capture or all‐embracing financialization, the comments submitted to the CFTC display an overriding opposition in the justifications used by commenters to explain their preferences. Commenters from the financial services and allied sectors consistently adopt a language of technical legitimation. Commenters in agriculture, livestock, retail energy, and many nonmarket organizations adopt a language of moral justification. The clarity of the divide between these two idioms indicates that the underlying purposes of new financial instruments are now being questioned. Even in the realm of esoteric financial instruments such as derivatives, the moral economy of market competition is once again subject to debate among market participants as well as observers.",2024-02-13,

Downside risks to the outlook include (1) an escalation of the recent conflict in the Middle East and associated commodity market disruptions; (2) financial stress amid elevated debt and high borrowing costs; (3) persistent inflation; (4) weaker-than-expected activity in China; (4) trade fragmentation; and (5) climate-related disasters. Against this backdrop, policy makers around the world face enormous challenges. Even though investment in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) will likely remain subdued, lessons learned from episodes of investment growth acceleration over the past seven decades highlight the importance of macroeconomic and structural policy actions and their interaction with well-functioning institutions in boosting investment and thus long-term growth prospects. At the global level, cooperation must strengthen to provide debt relief, facilitate trade integration, tackle climate change, and alleviate food insecurity.

Fiscal Policy in Commodity Exporters: An Enduring Challenge,"No AccessFeb 2024Fiscal Policy in Commodity Exporters: An Enduring ChallengeAuthors/Editors: World BankWorld Bankhttps://doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-2017-5_ch4AboutView ChaptersPDF (55.2 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract: Reports that fiscal policy has proven about 30 percent more procyclical and about 40 percent more volatile in commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) than in other EMDEs. Both procyclicality and volatility of fiscal policy—which share some underlying drivers—hurt economic growth because they amplify business cycles. Structural policies, including exchange rate flexibility and the easing of restrictions on international financial transactions, can help reduce fiscal procyclicality and volatility. Adopting average advanced-economy policies regarding exchange rate regimes, restrictions on cross-border financial flows, and the use of fiscal rules, commodity-exporting EMDEs can increase their GDP per capita growth by about 1 percentage point every four to five years through the reduction in fiscal policy volatility. Such policies require sustainable, well-designed, and stability-oriented fiscal institutions that can help build buffers during commodity price booms to prepare for any subsequent slump in prices. A strong commitment to fiscal discipline remains critical for these institutions to effectively achieve their objectives.

"Unmasking honey adulteration : a breakthrough in quality assurance
  through cutting-edge convolutional neural network analysis of thermal images","Honey, a natural product generated from organic sources, is widely recognized for its revered reputation. Nevertheless, honey is susceptible to adulteration, a situation that has substantial consequences for both the well-being of the general population and the financial well-being of a country. Conventional approaches for detecting honey adulteration are often associated with extensive time requirements and restricted sensitivity. This paper presents a novel approach to address the aforementioned issue by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of honey samples based on thermal images. The use of thermal imaging technique offers a significant advantage in detecting adulterants, as it can reveal differences in temperature in honey samples caused by variations in sugar composition, moisture levels, and other substances used for adulteration. To establish a meticulous approach to categorizing honey, a thorough dataset comprising thermal images of authentic and tainted honey samples was collected. Several state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were trained and optimized using the dataset that was gathered. Within this set of models, there exist pre-trained models such as InceptionV3, Xception, VGG19, and ResNet that have exhibited exceptional performance, achieving classification accuracies ranging from 88% to 98%. Furthermore, we have implemented a more streamlined and less complex convolutional neural network (CNN) model, outperforming comparable models with an outstanding accuracy rate of 99%. This simplification offers not only the sole advantage of the model, but it also concurrently offers a more efficient solution in terms of resources and time. This approach offers a viable way to implement quality control measures in the honey business, so guaranteeing the genuineness and safety of this valuable organic commodity.",2024-02-12,
Macroeconomic uncertainty and earnings management: evidence from commodity firms,"Abstract This study examines the relationship between macroeconomic uncertainty and earnings management, using quarterly data of US commodity firms from the period 1990–2019. The findings show that oil and iron firms use both accruals and real activities to decrease earnings in quarters with high basis risk. Earnings management is economically significant. Further investigation provides fine-grained evidence that specific types of uncertainty (economic policy, climate policy, geopolitical) have varying effects on earnings management. The study also provides evidence that earnings management is aimed at giving investors useful information about the firms’ performance during uncertain times. The study contributes to previous research on uncertainty and earnings management. It also informs market participants about the financial reporting quality of commodity firms, and has practical implications for financial reporting regulation in extracting industries.",2024-02-08,
Heritage and Destination Conscience: Empowering Communities and Enhancing Tourism Experiences,"Abstract This chapter examines the role of heritage as a means of empowering destination communities and providing deeper and more meaningful encounters between tourists and their destination, which contributes to the notion of Destination Conscience by highlighting more sustainable and humane ways of ‘doing’ tourism and opening places up to greater community involvement and access by visitors. This includes heritage concepts such as Indigenous communities, local spirituality and religious traditions, public archaeology and ordinary heritage, and how these translate into deeper engagement between residents and tourists, community empowerment and a more creative and holistic tourist experiences. Conceptually, this chapter highlights notions of empowerment, tourists' experiences and Destination Conscience.

Introduction Much tourism until now has focused on extremes – the biggest, the most beautiful, the furthest and the oldest. This is especially apparent in the context of traditional heritage tourism. Heritage assets are a salient part of the supply side of tourism, with the majority of mass tourism focusing on the extraordinary, ancient and most tangible elements of cultural heritage (Timothy, 2018). Heritage is the contemporary use of the past – tangible and intangible, including the living cultural present. It is something humankind values and hopes to pass on to future generations. Heritage is very community-oriented and value-laden (Den, 2014; Kyriakidis, 2019) and is now seen as a salient means of protecting local identities, empowering Indigenous communities and providing opportunities for tourists to learn about, and appreciate, destinations more fully. Heritage tourism – the use of the past (tangible and intangible) for tourism purposes – is one of the most pervasive forms of tourism on the planet, and nearly every trip includes some element of the cultural past, whether culture is a serious pursuit or a more casual, tangential element of a different kind of journey (McKercher, 2002; Timothy, 2021a). Heritage tourism has existed for centuries and has now become one of the most salient elements of mass tourism almost everywhere. The current concept of ‘overtourism’ is closely connected to mass tourism. Overtourism is characterised by conditions of too much tourism to the point where destination residents are unhappy about the sector and the social and ecological impacts it effects in their home regions. Popular heritage destinations currently experiencing high levels of overtourism include Barcelona, Rio de Janeiro, Venice, Prague, Vienna, Dubrovnik, Kyoto, Rome, Santorini, Munich, Amsterdam, Budapest and many others (Milano et al., 2019; Pechlaner et al., 2020). In these places, tourism has created contentious relationships between locals and tourists, diminishing the visitor experience and increasing discontent among residents, often thwarting the very notion of Destination Conscience. These conditions have weakened Destination Conscience as communities feel powerless to effect change in their quality of life and the places where they live. Empowerment is key in building community conscience and satisfying tourists who seek deeper experiences. Despite its centrality in mass tourism and part of the cause of overtourism, heritage tourism has the potential to empower communities as they use their past in sustainable ways to develop their present socio-economic well-being and build community solidarity for greater Destination Conscience (Aznar & Hoefnagels, 2019; Boley & Johnson Gaither, 2016; Chong & Balasingam, 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Su et al., 2023; Timothy, 2015, 2021a). This chapter describes the role of four different manifestations of heritage in creating more empowered communities, greater Destination Conscience as manifested in enabling alternative access to communities and a greater valuing of local cultures, and therefore, more meaningful touristic encounters. Heritage, Tourism and Empowerment Empowerment is a key construct of successful and sustainable tourism development, and therefore, an important manifestation of Destination Conscience in how communities can choose their own futures and how their cultural inheritances are promoted for tourism or hidden from tourists' gaze. Empowerment occurs when bottom-up development replaces top-down development, when ideas, actions and benefits become grassroots endeavours rather than being imposed from above by governments or powerful elites with personal financial interests (Timothy, 2012). For most of tourism's history, particularly in the Global South, tourism has empowered the wealthiest and most influential stakeholders, while simultaneously disempowering the communities whose natural and cultural heritage is on display. This has accentuated the distances between the haves and the have-nots in society. However, since the 1990s, there has been a greater appreciation among development and planning specialists of the need for a more balanced, harmonious, equitable and sustainable approach to tourism. Part of the answer to these challenges is empowerment, including the empowerment of the most traditionally disempowered sectors of society (e.g., women, ethnic minorities and migrants). There are many types of community empowerment that exist within the framework of socio-economic development. These include political, social, psychological and economic empowerment, among others (Scheyvens, 2002; Scheyvens & van der Watt, 2021). Political empowerment is evident when the people who are most impacted by tourism have a voice in whether or not to accept tourism, reject it or modify it to meet their needs. Community cohesion and solidarity (not necessarily full agreement) and cooperation for mutual benefits are indicative of social empowerment. Psychological empowerment prevails in a community when its collective confidence and esteem are central to planning and promoting tourism, and when communities take pride in what is unique about them and choose either to promote their uniqueness or hide it from the tourist gaze. Economic empowerment indicates conditions where employment opportunities are plentiful, money is earned to fund public services, and all segments of society have opportunities to benefit financially if they choose to do so (Scheyvens, 1999). There are many themes within heritage tourism studies that clearly manifest the notions of Destination Conscience and empowerment (Timothy, 2020a). These include, but are not limited to, local faith traditions, pilgrimages and sacred spaces; public archaeology; Indigenous communities; and ordinary heritage. These are examined briefly below and their applications to principles of empowerment are highlighted. Local Spiritual and Religious Traditions For millennia, humans have worshipped the divine and venerated sacred places (Coleman & Elsner, 1995). Some of the earliest Neolithic sites of ancient worship have been found in Turkey, Malta and South Asia, and have become significant places of modern-day worship and tourism. Religion is a pure manifestation of heritage because of its rituals, belief systems, practices, recitations and prayers, sacred writ, holy sites and pilgrimages. All of these elements of spirituality or religious worship are manifestations of faith heritage that are extremely meaningful for the faithful and of cultural interest to others. As part of their religious practices, believers have travelled in search of the sacred, to draw close to gods, seek absolution from sins, beseech deity for favours and blessings, to be healed in body or spirit and to satisfy religious obligations. Some religions require travel to sacred sites to achieve salvation in the afterlife (e.g. Islam and some Christian sects), while others encourage it as a life-enrichening experience but not a requirement (Olsen & Trono, 2018; Ron & Timothy, 2019). Long-distance pilgrimages became common in European societies with the Christianisation of Europe during the late Roman Empire and into the Middle Ages (Birch, 1998). In ancient East and South Asia, pilgrimages took shape in a large number of sacred places (Griffin et al., 2018; Stoddard, 1994). Intra-European pilgrimages and religious travel between Europe and the Holy Land began in late antiquity and lasted far into the Middle Ages until the Reformation and bubonic plague slowed it down dramatically (Ron & Timothy, 2019). Today, pilgrimages are among the largest tourist gatherings in the world, with the Kumbh Mela and the Hajj being counted among them, in many ways resembling the large-scale mass tourism seen in other sorts of destinations (Qurashi, 2017; Shinde, 2021). Despite these extremely popular, long-distance and global pilgrimages, the majority of pilgrimage behaviour takes place in local environs, where vernacular shrines, temples, churches and other sacred spaces are venerated by certain segments of society but might not appeal to the masses (Bremborg, 2013; Frascaroli, 2016). Most sacred places are small scale and unremarkable, and used by a limited number of area faithful (Liutikas, 2014; Stefko et al., 2013). ‘Folk shrines’ of regional or local importance, sometimes not even officially acknowledged by a faith organisation, as well as sites associated with hometown religious leaders and places where miracles of local acclaim occurred, are the focus of much veneration and pilgrimage-like activity. These everyday localities enrichen the cultural milieu and heritage landscapes of places (Burgassi, 2019) which, together with other elements of human heritage, manifest as unique, interesting and value-laden spaces of potential tourist attention. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many religious adherents to cancel or postpone their pilgrimage journeys abroad. In this process, an increasing number of adherents focused on religious sites of local significance, deepening their sense of place and valuation of regional religious heritage in place of the global (Olsen & Timothy, 2020). This process brought greater visibility to local religious sites. This, in conjunction with various globalisation processes and increased use of the internet and social media, has made what was once a local and common phenomenon (folk shrines and area pilgrimages) into a global phenomenon with widespread currency, particularly among people who seek deeper and more meaningful place-based experiences. Thus, globalisation, the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing interest in deeper, more meaningful experiences have pushed ‘…small, regional shrines and sacred sites to the forefront of global tourism. This means that many folk shrines of local renown now have the potential to become destinations of more international acclaim’ (Timothy & Olsen, 2023, p. 470). As locally valued religious heritage and practices reach the global stage and as the potential for tourism growth is realised in their ordinary places of religious heritage (Aulet & Vidal, 2018; Shyju et al., 2020), communities may become increasingly united, emboldened and empowered through solidarity of purpose, with the knowledge that their local traditions have importance not only to them but to outsiders as well. Public Archaeology Archaeological sites are one of the most pervasive heritage assets and among the most visited localities in the world. Every place of human habitation has an archaeological record, although some places choose to emphasise it in their heritagisation processes, including tourism, more than other places. A different perspective on heritage tourism and Destination Conscience can be understood through public archaeology – an activity that engages the public in archaeology through tours of excavations and sites, interpretive programmes, volunteer opportunities, public education lectures and other outreach activities. This is a process of democratising heritage so that it is both more accessible to the public and reflects better the public's own heritage. This is particularly important in descendant communities, whose own ancestors are the focus of archaeological work. Whereas traditional archaeological research has focused solely on the scientific study of material culture from the past, sometimes to the exclusion of the communities whose history is being studied, archaeologists have come to terms with the idea that communities are important stakeholders and partners in their scientific inquiry, that the public is in fact the client, the audience and equal partners in archaeological pursuits (SAA, 2023). This has led to the suggestion that archaeologists have now come ‘out of their fortresses’ (Gürsu, 2020, p. 58) and have democratised the past for general consumption. Although public archaeology has existed for many years in one form or another, the term was coined and its systematic practice came about in the 1970s with the realisation that public support is crucial to the work of archaeologists. Volunteering at archaeological sites, archives, cultural centres and museums, at home or elsewhere, is a clear display of public archaeology (Timothy, 2020b). Archaeology-based volunteer tourism and leisure engages the public, makes findings more accessible to the community and builds public awareness. The democratisation of archaeological heritage forwards the idea that the public has the right of access to its own heritage, and such efforts should be encouraged as a way to enhance educational opportunities, reaffirm local identity and roots and improve a community's quality of life (Corbishley, 2011). Archaeologists and many heritage resource managers have been reluctant to accept tourism as a legitimate use of the archaeological record. However, given increasingly scarce public and private funds for undertaking research and with a growing ethos of public outreach and community partnerships in heritage-making, most archaeologists now recognise the need to facilitate and encourage tourism as a means of justifying and funding their studies (Gillot, 2020). This democratisation of archaeology may also have the effect of empowering communities and creating conscientious stewards of human heritage, including community members, archaeologists and the tourists themselves. In the words of Gillot (2020, p. 36), public archaeology and archaeology-based tourism have ‘the potential of not only bringing financial gains but also helping to create a more cohesive identity within local or descendant communities’. Indigenous Communities An important manifestation of heritage is Indigenous practices and Indigenous knowledge. Part of the deeper engagement with destination communities is manifest in the area of Indigenous tourism (Melubo, 2023; Ruhanen & Whitford, 2019). The archaeological record and other manifestations of heritage are particularly relevant for descendant communities, and this is especially the case with Indigenous communities that face challenges to protecting their distinctive identities. Many elements of native people's culture are on the verge of disappearing through acculturation processes, environmental changes, overtourism, globalisation or simply modern-day living (Ruhanen & Whitford, 2019; Stonefish & Kwantes, 2017). Heritage tourism and other celebrations of living and tangible heritage can help preserve Indigenous cultures, deepen people's roots, connect them more closely to their ancestral lands and provide a sense of intergenerational continuity (Stronza, 2008; Timothy & Tahan, 2020). When native-led tourism initiatives dominate and native people are empowered to show what they want to show to outsiders or hide what they do not want outsiders to see (Rigby et al., 2011), they will be more empowered and conscientious of their role in tourism. ‘When communities take ownership of the problems and benefits associated with tourism, they become psychologically empowered. When tourism brings employment and other economic advantages to the people who want to benefit from it…destination communities become economically empowered. When native people take pride in their cultural heritage and desire to share it with others through tourism, on their own terms of course, intra-community solidarity grows, and they become socially empowered. When decision-making derives from the grassroots level and as autochthonous societies have the power to welcome tourism or to resist it, they are becoming politically empowered’ (Timothy & Tahan, 2020, p. 215). Ordinary and Vernacular Heritage As noted at the outset, mass tourism has long centred on the extraordinary, momentous and opulent heritage of extraordinary people, including rulers, nobility, celebrities, great artists, politicians and famous military heroes. Yet, these people represent an infinitesimally small proportion of Earth's inhabitants. Their heritage has been well preserved, interpreted, marketed and sold as a tourism commodity, but what about the heritage of everyone else? Despite tourism's traditional focus on extraordinary and grandiose heritage, the cultural heritage of ordinary people, such as intangible traditions, small villages, farm buildings, industrial archaeology, cemeteries, fisheries, vernacular architecture, agricultural landscapes and other vestiges of ordinary life, is also an important part of the world's heritage milieu that deserves to be commemorated, celebrated and protected for its scientific and social value as well as for its tourism potential (Podder et al., 2018; Timothy, 2014, 2020a, 2022). The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) World Heritage List was a culprit in celebrating only the most glorious, universal heritage until recently, when the organisation later began to memorialise the commonplace heritage of ordinary people through its lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage and Cultural Landscapes (Labadi, 2013; Rössler, 2006). As people's ordinary heritage is valued by outsiders, pride in their local cultures increases (Butler et al., 2022; Nicholls et al., 2004), and there is a stronger desire to protect what might otherwise be lost in favour of something more ‘impressive’, extraordinary and of greater ‘universal value’ (Araoz, 2011). Enhanced Experiences: Deeper Engagement in Heritage Tourism As these examples demonstrate, various manifestations of heritage have the potential to empower communities and strengthen community conscience as local cultures become more accessible, more highly valued by tourists, the tourism system and residents whose culture is on display. This makes for a stronger foundation for niche and special interest tourisms. There is evidence that tourists are becoming more sophisticated and choosier about the destinations they visit and the activities they undertake (Moutinho et al., 2011). Although tourists generally want to see the world's momentous heritage, part of the growing sophistication and desired experiential touristic encounters, travel consumers are increasingly interested in seeing how ordinary people live. Expressions of ordinariness and vernacular lifestyles have been an important part of the heritage tourism product for many years, such as folk museums in the United Kingdom (Peate, 1949) and visits to Maasai tribal areas in Tanzania and Kenya (Buzinde et al., 2014; Melubo & Carr, 2019), but seeking ordinariness or gazing upon the ‘real lives’ of others is now a greater part of sought after touristic experiences (Timothy, 2021b). Many tourists are unsatisfied with the mass-produced package tours that have been so popular in the past, and they are far less content with the superficial engagement with places and peoples that typically defines mass tourism (Richards, 2015; Timothy, 2018; Yang, 2012). In addition, many travellers are choosing to avoid the most touristified destinations where overtourism dominates consumer landscapes. This has led to the identification of many types of special interest tourism that sometimes function as alternatives to mass tourism and include, for example, heritage tourism, sport tourism, culinary tourism, roots tourism, ecotourism, solidarity tourism, and many other actions that satisfy personal interests and create unique niche markets. These niche markets are evidence of people seeking deeper, more meaningful and immersive experiences that lead to greater knowledge, increased self-discovery, greater confidence in their place in the world, satisfying personal interests and gaining a deeper understanding of the plight of their earthly cohabitants (Chen & Rahman, 2018; Isaac, 2008; Scarles, 2009). Such changes in the demand for more existential tourist experiences will likely result in greater levels of empowerment in the destination as communities gain financially, politically, psychologically and socially through tourism, but this assertion is in desperate need of additional research. Many labels have been assigned to these deep travel experiences in recent years, including slow tourism, immersive tourism, geotourism, purposeful cultural tourism and co-creative tourism. Slow tourism emphasises a greater personal awareness of oneself and the world. It entails reduced speed and mobility by staying in a single location longer, getting to know the place's history and culture more intimately (Oh et al., 2016). Immersive tourism is similar to slow tourism in that it requires visitors to remain longer than usual, appreciating local lifestyles and foodways and learning about local cultures, possibly even participating in religious activities and studying local languages. Geotourism generally has two meanings. The first meaning is geology-based tourism. The second meaning is more culture- and place-oriented; it is tourism that sustains and enhances the distinctive geographical characteristics of a place (National Geographic, 2023). Purposeful cultural tourism denotes travel that is motivated primarily by a desire to learn about other cultures and heritages and to have a deep cultural experience (McKercher, 2002; Timothy, 2021a). Co-creative tourism emphasises deeper engagement between locals and tourists, where the experience is co-developed by destination residents/stakeholders and the tourists themselves for a more profound authentic and embedded encounter (Binkhorst & Den Dekker, 2009; Campos et al., 2018). What all of these tourisms have in common is a more meaningful and profound engagement with a destination, its history, its cultural heritage and its current inhabitants and their lifestyles. That tourists might want to see their vernacular architecture and landscapes and experience their everyday lives is a powerful force for destination communities. These recent movements within tourism enable communities to become more empowered to control their tourism futures and deeply involved in co-creating touristic experiences, while tourists simultaneously become more authentically engaged in local cultures and gain a deeper appreciation for the destination community. Conclusion Mass tourism, including heritage tourism, has traditionally focused on the extraordinary, most tangible and oldest heritage of humankind since it began to grow in the late 1800s. Heritage sites of global acclaim have become some of the most iconic symbols of tourism and nationalism, including the Great Wall of China, Machu Pichu, the temples of Thailand, the Pyramids of Egypt, Angkor Wat and the Roman Forum. Although heritage assets have been the backbone of most mass tourism, as noted above, heritage tourism has also emerged as a niche form of special interest tourism that may help empower communities politically, economically, socially and psychologically and develop a sense of common identity and Destination Conscience, as what was once local and ordinary becomes more valued at a greater scale. As heritage tourism empowers communities, they take greater pride in the remnants of their cultural past and desire to protect and promote it (or not) to outsiders. Thus, the valorisation of ordinary and Indigenous heritage, archaeological remains, faith traditions and other manifestations of heritage builds solidarity among community members and makes places desirable for tourists who seek deeper, more meaningful and existential travel experiences. The very idea that tourists might want to experience something that is rather mundane or ordinary can help build community cohesiveness and increase community conscience. Tourism has the potential to empower communities, or community cohorts, that have heretofore been either disempowered through tourism or otherwise neglected, including Indigenous people, ethnic minorities and women – all of whom have important heritage that deserves to be protected and shared with visitors from elsewhere, if its owners so desire. Raising the profile of a community's holistic heritage may have the effect of drawing tourists who seek more immersive experiences in the local and in the ‘Other’, for an empowered community is a desirable community whose members have a real stake in tourism's success which, as the contents of this book make perfectly clear, are important elements of Destination Conscience. Balance, harmony, equity and other principles of sustainable development may translate into a more conscientious destination that not only benefits more deeply from tourism in social and economic ways but also reflects a greater sense of purpose, value and meaning, which will no doubt translate into enhanced tourist experiences (Michalkó et al., 2015; Rivera et al., 2016; Sheldon, 2022), improved quality of life and a more content populace. This equals more confidence and perhaps an ability to interact more positively with visitors and help co-create more enjoyable and satisfactory tourist experiences in their communities as many contemporary tourists seek deeper, more rooted experiences in communities that are empowered to protect and share (or not) their heritages with the outside world.

"Unveiling the drivers of large-scale land acquisitions in Asian countries: society, economy and environment","The rapid surge in large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) has been triggered by the convergence of food, financial and environmental crises in the late 2000s. Since the 2008 commodity price spike, several Asian countries have become preferential targets for LSLAs carried out by foreign companies and governments. The rising interest in Asian farmlands and natural resources arose in a complex set of political transitions and socioeconomic dynamics that have shaped the whole continent in the last decades. This study relies on a dataset built on different data sources, from 2003 to 2021 for a total of 14,724 million hectares involved in LSLAs in Asia. The southeastern region is the most targeted one, with Indonesia and the Philippines as the principal host countries. The main investors are intraregional and, especially in private or stock-exchange listed companies, are from China and Malaysia, who intend to produce palm oil or rubber. Results partially confirm the initial hypothesis, showing that the endowment of land and water resources in host countries is positively related to the amount of land acquired. Findings also show that investors are looking for free market areas, with low trade barriers and low fiscal pressure, where the protection of workers’ rights is lower than that in their homeland.",2024-02-08,

"Economic Instability and Global Market Fluctuations in 2023: Analyzing Causes, Impacts, and Policy Responses","The economic instability and global market fluctuations that will occur in 2023 have created various complex economic challenges and have far-reaching impacts. These dynamics are influenced by various factors, including monetary and fiscal policies, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, and changes in commodity prices. The impact of this instability can be seen in financial markets, macroeconomics, business and industrial sectors, and has significant socio-economic consequences. This research aims to analyze the causes, impacts, and policy responses to economic instability and global market fluctuations in 2023. The method used is a descriptive qualitative approach with data obtained from various relevant research results or previous studies. Data processing is carried out carefully to ensure accurate and in-depth analysis. The results of this research show that the combination of the impact of monetary and fiscal policies, the ongoing influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical dynamics, and changes in commodity prices have contributed to global economic instability. This impact is manifested in financial market volatility, macroeconomic disruption, as well as impacts on business and industrial sectors. Socioeconomic consequences such as increasing poverty and income inequality underscore the need for effective policy responses. The policy responses taken include monetary policy strategies, fiscal measures, structural reforms, and international cooperation.",2024-02-06,
Новая экономическая стратегия Китая в странах Латинской Америки.,"At the beginning of the 21st century, China adopted a strategy of “going global”. In the first decade of the 21st century, much has been written about the growing international presence of the People's Republic of China, especially in developing regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America. China-Latin America relations have deepened significantly in recent years so much, that the first decade of the 21st century can be called the “Chinese decade of Latin America.” However, as predicted at the very beginning, Latin America's trade relations with China are characterized by exports of primary goods from the region and imports of manufactured goods from China. The commodity boom driven by China undoubtedly helped the region weather the global financial crisis that broke out in 2008/2009. Latin American politicians are increasingly concerned about the imbalance of their trade schemes, especially as the Asian giant is going through an economic decline, commodity prices tend to decrease.",2024-02-06,
Introduction: transformative social policy,"This chapter outlines the key contribution of the book, its method and its disciplinary context. Drawing on and contributing to relevant literature in the fields of social policy, sociology and political economy, the book establishes a concept of creative social policy, which concerns the emancipation of human capacity at the level of society. Discussing established academic and practical understandings of social policy, it seeks to create new meaning to the concept and contributes to the literature analysing the effects and outcomes of policy and the development and transformation of welfare states. Analyses within sociology and political economy of economization and financialization, including analyses of the merging of money and capital (or monetary and fiscal policy) are also important for this book (e.g. Adkins, 2018; Konings, 2018), which complement this literature by discussing concrete policies to transform the current functions of work and capital. Arguably, new concepts of social policy and new ways of thinking about economic production are needed at a time when the foundations of liberal democracy are increasingly unstable and when current forms of economic production have proved environmentally unsustainable. Creative social policy will be compared to and contrasted with Marxist accounts of collective emancipation, work (as the essential characteristic of human beings) and the critique of the commodity form of labour (e.g. Dean, 2020).",2024-02-06,
South Korea: Impact of The Ukraine and Russia conflict,"The specter of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict looms large, casting a long and unsettling shadow across the tapestry of the global economy. Its chilling tendrils reach even the most seemingly insulated corners, ensnaring nations like South Korea in its vortex. This vibrant Asian tiger, deeply entwined in the intricate web of global trade, finds itself thrust into the maelstrom of this geopolitical quagmire. The economic ramifications, far from being mere ripples, have unfurled in a multifaceted storm, presenting a formidable challenge to the nation's economic stability and demanding a nuanced and multifaceted response. At the heart of this economic tempest lies the intricate web of financial sanctions woven by a resolute coalition of nations against Russia. These measures, meticulously crafted to sever the arteries of the Russian war machine and isolate its economy, have sent tremors through the very foundations of global finance. Traditional trade and investment flows, once predictable currents, have become turbulent eddies, swirling with uncertainty and risk aversion. South Korea, with its extensive economic tentacles reaching across the dynamic landscapes of Europe and Asia, has inevitably felt the tremors of this financial earthquake. Navigating this altered landscape, where familiar landmarks have shifted and once-reliable harbors now harbor hidden shoals, presents a significant challenge to the nation's financial institutions and policymakers. The delicate dance of mitigating potential exposure to the unfolding economic turbulence requires a deftness of footwork and a keen eye for the ever-shifting sands of the global financial market. Further compounding the economic woes is the pronounced surge in the prices of vital commodities, particularly energy and agricultural products. Both Russia and Ukraine, hitherto considered reliable bastions of resource abundance, have seen their production and export capacities crippled by the conflict. This disruption has sent shockwaves through international markets, triggering a vertiginous spiral in the prices of these essential resources. South Korea, heavily reliant on imported energy and foodstuffs, finds itself on the receiving end of this price escalation. Inflated import costs threaten to erode the very foundations of consumer purchasing power, casting a long shadow over economic growth and raising the specter of potent inflationary pressures. The specter of empty shelves and rising prices haunts Korean households, adding a layer of human anxiety to the broader economic quandary. Finally, the conflict has thrown international supply chains into disarray. The delicate arteries of global trade, once pulsing with the lifeblood of commerce, have been severely constricted by the disruption of land and sea routes, further exacerbated by the sanctions imposed upon Russia. South Korea, intricately woven into the fabric of these globalized production and trade networks, finds itself grappling with the ramifications of these disruptions. Delays in the delivery of raw materials and manufactured components threaten to hobble its own industrial output and hamper its export competitiveness. The very engines of the Korean economic juggernaut sputter and cough, their rhythm disrupted by the absence of vital parts sourced from across the globe. The anxieties of factory owners and the concerns of everyday workers alike paint a poignant picture of the human cost of this economic maelstrom.",2024-02-05,
Navigating Choppy Waters: Interplay between Financial Stress and Commodity Market Indices,"Financial stress can have significant implications for individuals, businesses, asset prices and the economy as a whole. This study examines the nonlinear structure and dynamic changes in the multifractal behavior of cross-correlation between the financial stress index (FSI) and four well-known commodity indices, namely Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRBI), Baltic Dry Index (BDI), London Metal Index (LME) and Brent Oil prices (BROIL), using multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis (MFDCCA). For analysis, we utilized daily values of FSI and commodity index prices from 16 June 2016 to 9 July 2023. The following are the most important empirical findings: (I) All of the chosen commodity market indices show cross correlations with the FSI and have notable multifractal characteristics. (II) The presence of power law cross-correlation implies that a noteworthy shift in FSI is likely to coincide with a considerable shift in the commodity indices. (III) The multifractal cross-correlation is highest between FSI and Brent Oil (BROIL) and lowest with LME. (IV) The rolling windows analysis reveals a varying degree of persistency between FSI and commodity markets. The findings of this study have a number of important implications for commodity market investors and policymakers.",2024-02-04,

Carbon capture by phytomass storage and trading to mitigate climate change and preserve natural resources,"As climate-based catastrophes continue to seriously threaten human health and goods, natural resources, and ecological environments, we must act expeditiously to avoid more serious and irreversible consequences. Negative emission technologies (NETs) may inevitably be our best option in confronting this crisis. This study explores an aggregated strategy that provides a novel way in which to confront climate mitigation and resource preservation through carbon capture by phytomass storage and trading (CCPST). The CCPST process entails burying phytomass belowground or in deep ocean cavities where it can then be sold as a commodity in the form of futures (i.e., financial contracts), which would have little negative ecological or socioeconomic effects but provide enormous benefits to climate mitigation and resource preservation. Phytomass trading by issuing of phytomass futures for phytomass planting, collection, and storage would help to mitigate climate change and increase employment and investment incentives, which in turn would promote global economic growth as well as the health and welfare of humankind.",2024-02-02,
Dinamika Penentuan Dui Papenre’ dalam Perkawinan Adat Suku Bugis di Kalimantan Selatan: Dampak Terhadap Kehormatan Keluarga,"Abstract This research delineates the practice of determining dui papenre' in Bugis customary marriages in Tanah Bumbu Regency, South Kalimantan. Dui papenre' is a financial contribution required from the prospective husband for the wedding ceremony, with a relatively high amount. The determination is made by the family of the prospective wife, based on considerations such as the prices of basic commodities, family social status, and the education level of the prospective wife. Its impacts involve marriage postponements, cancellations, and additional burdens for married couples. Nevertheless, this practice also reflects the preservation of family status and honor, especially for the female party, in accordance with prevailing customary traditions. This study explores the social and cultural implications of dui papenre' determination and provides insights into the dynamics of marital relationships in Bugis communities in South Kalimantan.

Global impact of geopolitical oil price uncertainty and associated commodity prices on clean energy stocks,"Theoretically, geopolitical risk and policy uncertainties can directly affect energy markets. Since fluctuations in it lead to cost the of clean energy sources as they compete with traditional energy. Regarding this, our study aims to scrutinize the impact of geopolitical oil price uncertainty on clean energy stocks by controlling the influences of economic policy uncertainty, gold, natural gas, and coal prices. For that purpose, the study utilized monthly data from July 2007 to September 2020 and employed a machine learning method, namely kernel-based regularized least squares approach. Empirical analysis reveals that geopolitical oil price uncertainty and coal prices have a nonlinear positive effect on clean energy stock prices. It is also found that the impact of global economic policy uncertainty, gold, and natural gas prices on clean energy stock prices is nonlinear and negative. The implication signifies that clean energy stock prices are hampered by economic policy uncertainty, and gold, and natural gas prices, thus hindering the development of clean energy sources. Similarly, for the robustness of the study, the quantile regression approach and findings reveal similar outcomes to that of the KRLS model. Based on these findings, policy implications that potentially aid renewable energy investments are put forward. The study also guides investors, financial advisors, and portfolio managers for better decision-making in consideration of uncertainties and associated fluctuations in energy markets and commodity prices.",2024-02-01,
The Effect of Availability of Foreign Exchange and Devaluation of BIRR on the Performance of Companies in Ethiopia (Instance of Sample Company),"Purpose: When a country devalues its currency, some firms benefit from any resulting changes in relative prices, while other firms are relatively unaffected or suffer a loss in competitiveness.By taking a sample of import and export firms, this study assessed the effect availability of foreign currency and devaluation of BIRR (the Ethiopian national currency) on performance of firms in Ethiopia in general.Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used both primary (collected through questionnaire) and secondary data collected from financial statements of the companies.The study applies both the descriptive and inferential analysis.Findings: After detail analysis, the increase in private driven business, informal channels of inflow of foreign currency, increased population and corruption will worsen appropriate use of FOREX and aggravate challenges of shortage of it.And also it is found that the foreign currency shortage has affected the firms in many ways such as profit loss, lay off employees and discourages new investment.Practical Implications: Devaluation of BIRR against the foreign currencies makes Ethiopian commodities to be competitive in international markets.And it can also attract new investments and increase exports.Originality/Value: The study intended to assess the main challenges to access foreign currencies, assess the effects of foreign currency shortage on import/export firms, assess the effects of devaluation of BIRR on import/export firms and assess company-specific factors.",2024-02-01,
Qatar,"Qatar's decade-long efforts to diversify the economy culminated into the successful hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.After very strong performance in 2022 on the back of World Cupinduced buoyancy and high hydrocarbon prices, growth has been normalizing, with real GDP growth in 2023 projected at 1.6 percent.Growth normalization is expected to continue in the near term, with non-hydrocarbon growth supported by investment in public projects, construction of the North Field LNG expansion project, and their spillovers to logistics, manufacturing, and trade.Visibility brought by the WC could continue to boost tourism.Medium-term growth is expected to average around 5½ percent, boosted by significant LNG production expansion and initial reform gains from implementing the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), set to be released soon.As global commodity prices decline and domestic demand normalizes, headline inflation will likely ease to below 3 percent in 2023, and further to around 2 percent over the medium term.Amid high hydrocarbon prices, both fiscal and current account positions strengthened significantly in 2022, with surpluses reaching 10½ percent of GDP and 26½ percent of GDP, respectively.Both the fiscal and current accounts will likely remain in sizeable surplus supported by elevated, albeit declining, hydrocarbon prices projected for the medium term, and Qatar's LNG production expansion, coupled with increasing demand from Asia and Europe.Banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio and return on equity at 19 and 14.6 percent, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023.Banks' nonresident deposits fell by more than one-third from the recent peak, partially replaced by higher public sector domestic deposits, reducing vulnerabilities amid tight global financial conditions.The NPL ratio continued to edge up to 3.8 percent but the provisioning coverage ratio is relatively high, close to 80 percent.Banks were resilient to the financial market turmoil from advanced economies in early-2023.Structural reforms continue to progress, including to enhance protection and mobility of expatriate labor, improve the business environment, promote public-private partnerships, and further attract private investment through the residency program and broadened foreign ownership provisions.The pension scheme has been expanded to more Qataris in the private sector to promote private sector employment.Digitalization has continued to advance, and 1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.",2024-02-01,

Quantifying spillovers and connectedness among commodities and cryptocurrencies: Evidence from a Quantile-VAR analysis,"This study examines dynamic connectedness linkages between precious metals, manufacturing metals, oil, natural gas, and Bitcoin. The Quantile-VAR methodology is utilised to identify causal spillovers from 2015 through 2022, where results demonstrate significantly stronger pairwise connectedness at extreme quantiles, where the gold-silver and copper-oil pairs exhibit the strongest linkages. Additionally, the overall dynamic connectedness is higher at the lowest and highest quantiles, particularly reinforced during inflationary periods. Copper is identified as the strongest generator of spillovers, followed by silver, nickel, and zinc. There are mixed findings when analysing gold and aluminium, whereas oil, natural gas, and Bitcoin are identified as net receivers. This study provides insight into commodities and cryptocurrency markets' diversifying and hedging abilities during alternative economic and financial conditions.",2024-01-31,
The convenience yield under commodity financialization,"Abstract A number of papers have dealt with commodity financialization finding strong evidence for its existence and its effect on commodity prices and volatility. We chose convenience yield (CY) to study the effect of commodity financialization based on the theory of storage and on the argument that CY resembles a call option. Using quarterly data in the period 1995–2018, on soybeans stocks, cash and futures prices, a dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag with Exogenous model is estimated to measure the effects of independent variables from both the financial and commodity markets on CY. The evidence reveals that financial markets volatility along macroeconomic global variables affect soybeans CY giving support to the existence of commodity financialization. Besides, we find a statistically significant and negative relation between volatility index and CY. Support for this evidence rests on the theory of storage, Real Option Analysis, and behavioral finance.",2024-01-31,

Mas Kirana bananas are designated as Indonesian genetic resources based on the Decree of the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia Number 516/Kpts/SR.120/12/2005. This study aims to formulate a pattern of business capital formation and development strategy for Mas Kirana banana commodity as an effort to preserve Indonesia's germplasm. Data collection was done by structured interview method. Determination of the sample is done by snowball sampling technique. Data analysis was carried out using qualitative descriptive methods and Force Field Analysis (FFA). The results showed that the pattern of capital business capital formation for Mas Kirana's banana consisted of family capital, financial institution capital, non-financial institutional capital, and personal capital. The identification process resulted in 7 (seven) driving factors and 7 (seven) inhibiting factors for Mas Kirana banana development. Key Success Factors (FKK) for developing Mas Kirana Banana Farmers Groups on the driving factor dimension are the Mas Kirana Banana commodity which has a comparative advantage and is certified Geographically Indication (GI), while the inhibiting factor dimension is the weakness of farmer resources in managing and developing group finances. Based on the FKK value of the driving and inhibiting factors, the recommended strategy is farmer institutional engineering through the formation of the Mas Kirana banana farmer cooperative.",2024-01-31,
Analysis of donor investment in Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research,"The study examines the impact of foreign aid on agricultural research in Ethiopia over the period 2011-2020. According to the study, donor allocations averaged 23% of the total amount of funds received by the institution in the form of loans and grants in 2020. Donors' investment in Ethiopian agricultural research is decreasing and negative growth has been recorded, from 33% in 2016 to 23% in 2020. Donor aid funding decreased by 51.3% in 2019 and 84.6% in 2020 compared to 2018. In addition to joint research and financial investment, 65% of improved germplasm comes from donors directly through adaptation research or parent material. Furthermore, for which information is collected and available, 7.3% of trained scientists and 57% of fixed assets were financed by donors. The majority of the donor-funded projects focused on short-term goals that did not align with national priorities or focused on commodities of relatively low economic value to the country. Therefore, a new financial framework is needed for the government to set strategic priorities for donors to contribute to the country.",2024-01-31,

Environmental consequences of energy commodities and economic growth: Evidence from Nigeria,"This study explored the relationship between energy commodities, economic growth, and Nigeria&#39;s carbon dioxide (CO?) emissions spanning from 1981 to 2021. Employing the Vector Error Correction Mechanism (VECM) process, the study revealed a negative correlation between fossil fuel consumption, economic growth, and carbon dioxide emissions. Long-term elasticities indicate that carbon dioxide emissions would rise by 24 and 211% if both fossil fuel consumption and economic growth decreased by 1%, contradicting the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory in Nigeria. Nevertheless, a positive correlation was observed between carbon dioxide emissions and the total annual population. As per the error correction model (ECM = -2.64441), two years are required for carbon dioxide emissions to return to long-term equilibrium, with 26.4% of a shock in the variable resolved within a year. Upon closer examination of the impulse response function, it is evident that GDPPC and FFC will exert a negative short- and long-term impact on CO? emissions. The study proposes that Nigeria&#39;s government should implement a comprehensive strategy to bolster investments in renewable energy. This encompasses creating a stable policy environment, establishing ambitious targets for renewable energy capacity, providing financial incentives, and introducing feed-in tariffs, given that the country&#39;s consumption of fossil fuels has not yet reached a point where emissions are increasing. &nbsp; Key words: CO? emission, fossil fuel consumption, GDP per capita, VECM.",2024-01-31,
"Innovation’s, and civil servants’ behavioral models’ influence on the formation of customs authorities’ and financial intelligence units' cooperation and document exchange institutional conditions","The article examines the influence of innovation on the development of institutional conditions for cooperation and document exchange between customs authorities and financial intelligence units, considering the civil servants' behavior patterns as innovative approaches implementers. Cooperation between customs authorities and financial intelligence units provides a critical foundation for ensuring the integrity of international trade and financial systems. In a time of rapid technological advancement, innovation plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of this collaboration. Individual and organizational factors in the behavioral models' formation in the field of relevant cooperation and ways to increase the efficiency of interdepartmental cooperation are substantiated. Particular attention is paid to the procedure for the exchange of documents between customs authorities and financial intelligence units, considering commodity and financial flows in the global economy, and the inconsistency of national and international law in the international trade field certain provisions. The opportunities and challenges of such cooperation, incentives, and the ability to exchange information between customs authorities and financial intelligence units are identified. The need to introduce innovative tools and information exchange mechanisms specifically designed to identify suspicious signals in trade and financial transactions that may indicate crimes in international trade or sanctions evasion is argued. Instead of viewing innovation as a potential threat, customs authorities should actively engage with innovative enterprises to create mechanisms that consider technological advances. Such collaboration can lead to the development of systems and processes that not only ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, but also facilitate more convenient and efficient cross-border trade. The development of digital ecosystems opens promising opportunities for cooperation between customs and financial intelligence units. Such systems not only improve the efficiency of risk assessment, but also ensure financial crimes timely detection. This innovative approach creates a dynamic system that adapts to the changing nature of threats in global trade and finance.

Managing Postharvest Losses of Vegetables and Fruits: A Methodological Review,"Vegetables and fruits are highly perishable agricultural commodities cultivated all over the world. However, inadequate handling practices have led to significant postharvest losses of these agricultural commodities, as well as the wastage of valuable resources, such as time and money. Hence, it can be observed that cultivators often experience significant financial setbacks as a result of inadequate comprehension regarding the nature and origins of these losses, insufficient preservation practices, and ineffective approaches to transportation and marketing. In addition, the utilization of suitable chemical agents during both the pre- and postharvest phases has the potential to prolong the shelf life of agricultural products. This preservation technique safeguards vegetables and fruits from pathogenic organisms and other forms of environmental harm, thereby enabling their availability for an extended duration. Therefore, this review proposes a methodology for managing fruits and vegetables postharvest to minimize losses and optimize returns.",2024-01-29,
Earnings Inequality in Latin America: A Three-Decade Retrospective,"Latin American countries have some of the highest levels of income inequality in the world. However, earnings inequality have significantly changed over time, increasing during the 1980s and 1990s, declining sharply in the 2000s, and stagnating or even increasing in some countries since 2015. Macroeconomic instability in the region in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as the introduction of structural reforms like trade, capital, and financial liberalization, affected the patterns of relative demand and relative earnings across skill-demographic groups in the 1990s, increasing inequality. Significant gains in educational attainment, the demographic transition, and rising female labor force participation changed the skill-demographic composition of labor supply, pushing the education and experience premiums downward, but this was not enough to counteract demand-side trends. At the turn of the 21st century, improved external conditions, driven by China’s massive increase in demand for commodities, boosted economies across Latin America, which began to grow rapidly. Growth was accompanied by a positive shift in the relative demand for less-educated workers, stronger labor institutions, rising minimum wages, and declining labor informality, a confluence of factors that reduced earnings inequality. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, particularly after the end of the commodities price boom in 2014, economic growth decelerated, and the pace of inequality decline stagnated. There is extensive literature documenting and trying to explain the causes of recent earnings inequality dynamics in Latin America. This literature is examined in terms of themes, methodological approaches, and key findings. The focus is on earnings inequality and how developments in labor markets have shaped it.",2024-01-27,
Unmasking Honey Adulteration: A Breakthrough in Quality Assurance through Cutting-Edge Convolutional Neural Network Analysis of Thermal Images,"Honey, a natural product generated from organic sources, is widely recognized for its revered reputation. Nevertheless, honey is susceptible to adulteration, a situation that has substantial consequences for both the well-being of the general population and the financial well-being of a country. Conventional approaches for detecting honey adulteration are often associated with extensive time requirements and restricted sensitivity. This paper presents a novel approach to address the aforementioned issue by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of honey samples based on thermal images. The use of thermal imaging technique offers a significant advantage in detecting adulterants, as it can reveal differences in temperature in honey samples caused by variations in sugar composition, moisture levels, and other substances used for adulteration. To establish a meticulous approach to categorizing honey, a thorough dataset comprising thermal images of authentic and tainted honey samples was collected. Several state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were trained and optimized using the dataset that was gathered. Within this set of models, there exist pre-trained models such as InceptionV3, Xception, VGG19, and ResNet that have exhibited exceptional performance, achieving classification accuracies ranging from 88% to 98%. Furthermore, we have implemented a more streamlined and less complex convolutional neural network (CNN) model, outperforming comparable models with an outstanding accuracy rate of 99%. This simplification offers not only the sole advantage of the model, but it also concurrently offers a more efficient solution in terms of resources and time. This approach offers a viable way to implement quality control measures in the honey business, so guaranteeing the genuineness and safety of this valuable organic commodity.",2024-01-27,
The Urgency of Comprehensive and Integrated Digital Asset Regulation,"Cryptocurrency has grown rapidly since it was first introduced to the public. Many countries, including Indonesia, have begun to adopt special regulations for cryptocurrencies in response to the exponential growth and penetration of cryptocurrencies in the traditional financial system. Regulations aim to protect investors, ensure economic stability, and prevent illegal activities such as terrorism, money laundering and tax evasion. In January 2023, Law Number 4 of 2023 concerning Development and Strengthening of the Financial Sector (""UU P2SK"") was enacted as a form of financial sector reform. Starting January 2025, regulation and supervision of cryptocurrency transactions will be carried out by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) replacing the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti) which has established several regulations regarding Crypto assets. But until now There are no regulations regarding permits or prohibitions for influencers/celebrities in marketing crypto assets via social media or other media to the public even though these regulations are needed to mitigate the incidence of victims and losses, as in several cases that have occurred. In the future, a comprehensive and integrated regulation is needed with other laws and regulations such as the Terrorism Law, the Money Laundering Crime Law, the Consumer Protection Law, the ITE Law, the Criminal Code and other related laws and regulations, in order to keep up with the rapid development of cryptocurrency and the changing character of the digital world. global and borderless.",2024-01-27,
Urban Farming Dengan Teknologi Precision Farming Sebagai Upaya Meningkatkan Kesejahteraan Masyarakat dan Pemanfaatan Lahan Kosong,"Urban Farming is proposed as a solution for unused land (empty land), as well as allowing residents to increase productivity by managing unproductive empty land. The community service program (PKM) is implemented by STIE Indonesia Jakarta in partnership with PT Alif Tekno Farm (ATF). PKM was carried out in Kebon Baru, Tebet, South Jakarta, near the Ciliwung river. The priority of this community service is to empower unemployed individuals or communities while utilizing empty land in urban areas. This program uses precision farming technology with a Smart Nutrition Valve (KNP) tool that saves water, fertilizer, energy and labor. The commodity being developed is a short-lived fruit plant (65 days) which is suitable for lowland areas, namely melons. Training and mentoring is carried out by PT ATF from sowing to harvest.

A data-driven approach for optimal operational and financial commodity hedging,"Commodity price risk management has been subject to various modeling and optimization approaches. Recently, data-driven policies focusing on the decision rather than prediction quality have been developed to overcome price model misspecification. Yet, in the context of data-driven commodity purchasing, the existing literature either considers anticipatory inventory management or forward contracting where the decision frequency corresponds to the maturity of the traded contracts. We prove the optimality of a novel procurement policy combining operational and financial instruments with decision granularities independent of the derivative's maturity. A mixed-integer programming model is developed to train policy parameters efficiently. We study the implications of policy complexity for learning-stability and out-of-sample generalization. Finally, we backtest the data-driven policy on real market data of four major commodities (i. e., copper, nickel, corn, and soybean) over ten years and show that the average savings potential of a combined financial and operational procurement policy compared to single-instrument strategies is up to 6.38 % for corn where warehousing can efficiently mitigate price seasonality. The approach hedges corn and soybean commodities more efficiently through inventories while copper and nickel can be hedged efficiently by leveraging available financial instruments. Best model results are identified for a decision granularity with fewer parameters as high-frequent decisions deteriorate learning stability and model generalization.",2024-01-25,
The Euro as a Store of Value,"Money has accompanied humankind throughout the long history of development and has continued to this day. This development took place along the lines of maintaining two basic functions – money as a medium of exchange and money as a store of value. The second mentioned function is in our focus because as a financial asset, money has a significant place in the structure of personal financial assets (PFA) of households. Historical experience proves that the preservation of value of money was often a challenge. Goal of this paper is to look at whether money nowadays fulfill the function of preserving values. We state hypothesis that ECB is successful in protecting the value of Euro. We gradually compare the Euro with other assets, either from the foreign exchange or the commodity market. We also observe how the value of the purchasing power of the Euro is affected by the HICP inflation index. Our results indicate that the Euro manages to keep its value in the monitored period only against the US dollar. All other observations ended with the decrease of value of the Euro. The result of the investigation is the finding that the topic of decrease of the value of Euro is relevant in the Eurozone today as well.",2024-01-25,
Financial Market Stress and Commodity Returns: A Dynamic Approach,"This paper examines the relationship between commodity index returns and the Office of Financial Research Financial Stress Index (OFR FSI). Utilizing the S&amp;P GSCI and its five sub-indices (agriculture, livestock, energy, industrial metals, and precious metals), we find that the causal relationship between financial market stress and commodity index returns is conditional on the sample period examined and the methodology employed. We also note that stress in financial markets has a negative relationship with commodity index returns during low commodity return states; however, during high commodity return states, financial market stress exhibits a positive relationship with commodity index returns. Our findings highlight the importance of considering a time-varying framework for analyzing commodity return dynamics.",2024-01-24,
From Micro to Macro: Estimating Commodity Emissions and Water Exposures from Corporate Data,"In recent years, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) themes have become increasingly influential in investors' portfolios. Typically, corporate data are utilized to construct company-level metrics, following which portfolios are constructed by tilting and/or excluding the relevant equity and fixed income instruments. Given the growing regulatory and shareholder focus on the topic, there is mounting interest in assessing whether this approach can be extended to incorporate portfolios comprising commodity futures. The authors propose a methodology for estimating emissions and water usage during the production process of metals included in the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM)—a financial benchmark used by investors—using corporate financial, greenhouse gas emissions, and water usage data. The authors' approach uses a regression-based analysis and spans data from 2011 to 2021. The results provide per-commodity estimates, including standard errors and confidence intervals, to account for differences in emissions and water usage based on geography, technologies, and energy mix.",2024-01-24,
Financial subordination of peripheral emerging economies: a Keynesian–Structuralist approach,"This paper aims to contribute to a more in-depth discussion of the financial subordination of peripheral emerging economies (PEEs) by connecting financial asymmetry with productive asymmetry. For this purpose, it sets out a Keynesian–Structuralist approach to the financial subordination of PEEs, and to the center–periphery relationship applied to the process of international financial integration. To that end, the paper shows that productive and financial asymmetries are related to each other, that is, they are ‘two sides of the same coin’: PEEs which have low-complexity productive structures and are commodity exporters tend to be much more volatile – that is, they are more subject to the boom and bust of the commodity cycle and the liquidity cycle – and therefore are more financially subordinated than PEEs which have more complex productive structures and are exporters of manufactured goods.",2024-01-24,
Evaluating the dynamic connectedness of financial assets and bank indices during black-swan events: A Quantile-VAR approach,"This study examines whether precious metals, industrial metals, energy and agricultural commodities, or cryptocurrencies form trustworthy safe havens against extreme price volatility of major global bank stock indices during black-swan events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Using daily data and applying Quantile-VAR dynamic pairwise and extended joint connectedness methodologies, we investigate dynamic connectedness between major financial assets and major bank indices during exceptional crises. Findings provide evidence that crude oil and both Ethereum and Bitcoin present evidence of propagating significant shocks towards bank stock indices during crises, but other large-cap cryptocurrencies present no evidence of any specific influence. Further, gold, natural gas, and wheat are identified as the main absorbers of spillovers from banking indices during analysed crises, with more pronounced effects identified during exceptional phases of volatility. Such findings suggest that risk in the banking sector can be efficiently hedged by traditional safe havens such as gold and counterbalanced by highly outperforming assets such as natural gas and wheat. The study significantly contributes to understanding the interplay between banking sectors and various financial assets during crises and the subsequent strategies available for managing systemic risks, providing valuable insights for policymakers, regulators, and investors alike.",2024-01-23,
"Availing Technology Options for Small-Scale Farmers: The Case of Pre-Extension Demonstration of Improved Rice Technology at Ilu-Harar District of Western Oromia, Ethiopia","This activity, Pre-extension Demonstration and Evaluation of Improved Rice Technology was carried out in the Ilu-Harar district, Jagan PA of the then Ilu-Ababora zone of Western Oromia on four (4) farmers and on 10*10 m2 plots of land for each. In addition; this activity was to address and achieve the following objectives; to demonstrate & evaluate improved rice technologies with FRGs, to create awareness of the importance of the commodity, to make better linkage with target beneficiaries and stakeholders, and finally to collect feedback on the performance of rice production technologies. Consequently, the activity was conducted for one year using two varieties; Chawaka and NERICA-1 as a standard check. Accordingly; the Chawaka variety beat the standard check in all of the traits except the time of maturity which takes a longer period than the standard check. To this end farm mean yield performance of the Chawaka and the standard check; NERICA-1 were 45.57 qt/ha and 31.30 qt/ha; respectively, and on average Chawaka had a yield advantage of 45.59 % over NERICA-1 and this implies that Chawaka had higher yield advantage than NERICA-1. Moreover; when comparing the potential of the varieties acquired up on release in terms of the potential gap existing between the performance of the technology/ variety on the research station versus demonstration yield on farmers' fields there exists even similarity on the Chawaka variety but 7.2 qt/ha of yield reduction on NERICA-1 variety. Further; the statistical ANOVA table and mean yield comparison (t-test) results of on-farm yield performances showed that there is a highly significant difference at (p˂0.05) between the varieties demonstrated. Furthermore; in terms of profitability, the financial analysis result of the study also showed that using the Chawaka variety can make it more profitable than NERICA-1. Eventually; therefore, as the variety has met the intended criteria of the farmers and was selected as the best variety the pre-scaling up activity should follow next for a greater number of farmers and on a wider area in the coming years.",2024-01-23,
Management Information Systems for Tree Fruit—1: A Review,"A farm management information system (MIS) entails record keeping based on a database management system, typically using a client-server architecture, i.e., an information system, IS, coupled with a variety of tools/methods/models for the support of operational management. The current review adopts a multivocal approach to consider academic and commercial developments in MISs for orchard management, based primarily on the refereed literature but extending to grey literature and interviews of Australian mango orchard managers. Drivers for orchard MIS development include increasing the orchard size and management complexity, including regulatory requirements around labour, chemical spray use and fertilisation. The enablers include improvements in within-orchard communications, distributed (web) delivery systems using desktop and mobile devices, and sensor systems and predictive models, e.g., for pest management. Most orchard MIS-related publications target the commodities of apple, grape, mango and olive in the context of management of plant health (pest and disease), plant development, irrigation and labour management. Harvest forecast and MIS modules are only now beginning to emerge, in contrast to a long history of use in grain production. The commercial systems trend towards an incorporation of financial information, an integration of data from multiple sources and a provision of dashboards that are tailored to the user. Requirements for industry adoption of a MIS are discussed in terms of technical and design features, with a focus on usability and scalability.",2024-01-22,
Trend-Enhanced Improved Bollinger Bands Trend-Following High-Frequency Trading Strategy for Futures Market,"The application of digital scientific technologies in the global financial markets has become widespread, which has led to the prevalence of the concept of quantitative trading. Among various quantitative trading strategies, high-frequency trading has gained significant popularity. In this study, we propose an improved Bollinger Bands trend-following high-frequency trading strategy based on trend enhancement. Instead of using the simple moving average (SMA), we replace it with the exponential moving average (EMA). Furthermore, we introduce a 3-times average true range (ATR) limit price rebound exit system to achieve timely profit-taking and stop-loss. By incorporating trend measurement indicators such as the average directional index (ADX), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and commodity channel index (CCI), we determine the futures trend. Subsequently, this study formulates suitable parameters for the high-frequency trading strategy and conduct backtesting on the 2022 CSI 300 stock index futures, resulting in a remarkably high annualized return. These results present a novel approach to high-frequency trading strategy and provide valuable insights for the market.",2024-01-22,

Analysis of the Impact of US Quantitative Easing Policy on China's Macro Economy,"The 2008 financial crisis caused many large enterprises to go bankrupt. In order to revitalize the crumbling economy and inject liquidity into the financial markets, US has carried out four rounds of QE policy. Since the COVID-19, America has resorted to unlimited quantitative easing in hopes of saving economy. The United States' QE has an impact on China's economic development due to their frequent economic interactions, and this impact will unavoidably spread as a result of QE's spillover effects. This research examines the Fed's QE monetary policy influence on Asian's biggest country economy in two time period, after the 2008 financial crisis and during the new coronavirus pandemic, in depth using current theories. In this study, the content of the QE monetary policy in the American continent is introduced, the implementation backdrop and impact of the policy are examined. The main focus of this paper is to present the impact of US QE monetary policy on China’s economy. First of all, US policy impact will inevitably spread to China's monetary policy and exchange rate policy. Secondly, the QE’s spillover effect of Chinese inflation is analyzed from RMB appreciation and commodity price rise. Third, the capital market's strong liquidity will lead to the inflow of international capital into our country due to the United States' QE monetary policy, so the impact on our capital market is analyzed. Fourthly, it analyzes the impact of dollar depreciation brought about by QE on the China's foreign exchange assets safety.",2024-01-22,
Inflation-Driven Derivative Investment Strategies: A Comparative Analysis of Chinese and US Enterprises in 2022,"Affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, climate change and other reasons, the global economy has shown an inflationary trend. In the context of inflation, governments and companies will bear different levels of risk. As a hedging tool, derivatives have become an important tool for all asset owners to fight against inflation risk. Through the comparative analysis of the derivative investment strategies of multiple enterprises in China and the United States in 2022, this paper tries to obtain the types of investment strategies of enterprises using derivative investment to combat inflation risk under the inflation. It has been observed that in 2022, enterprises primarily face inflation risks related to exchange rates, interest rates, and depreciation of enterprise value. In order to mitigate these risks, the formulation of the enterprise's derivative investment strategy takes into account various factors such as the enterprise's production and operation strategy, regional standard systems, and currency settlement types. Finally, based on comparative analysis, it is posited that enterprises exhibit a greater inclination towards employing interest rate and exchange rate derivatives as a means to mitigate inflation risk. In contrast, general investors can derive enhanced hedging functionality by utilizing commodity options and futures. However, when employing financial derivatives for investment purposes, one must consider the integrity of the derivatives market as well as the positioning within the industrial chain.",2024-01-22,
Hedging Strategies with Derivatives after 2020,"This paper examines the changes in the futures market and how Chinese companies have hedged in recent years. As is known to all, the world has experienced lots of events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine Conflict, the economic recession, and the rising interest rate in the U.S. Under the risky circumstances, the foreign exchange market and commodity futures market have shown a larger volatility. During times of global economic turmoil, the investors in the financial markets are seeking opportunities to protect their investment portfolios and assets. Historically, the futures market can be seen as a safe haven for funds, mitigating losses caused by fluctuations in stock or commodity prices through proper hedging strategies. This paper analyses what the Chinese futures and spot markets are like and how Chinese companies use hedging tools to lock profits. Then, the paper gives suggestions and prospects for futures hedging and the development of markets.",2024-01-22,

To facilitate this, the work shall investigate reasons behind the change in the Russian ruble’s status, determine the then functions performed by the latter abroad. Materials and methods. The study focuses on regulatory and legal documents aimed at administering state policy of the Russian Empire in the fields of money circulation and development of trade relations with Inner Asian countries, investigates related archival materials housed at the State Archive of Buryatia and that of Irkutsk Oblast. The key research methods employed include that of historical reconstruction, and chronological, statistical, systemic historical ones. These put together have made it possible to reconstruct how the status of Russian ruble in Mongolia’s financial market would change in the context of large-scale political and economic processes witnessed by nations of Inner Asia during the period in question. Results. The development of trade relations between Imperial Russia and Inner Asian nations entailed multiple changes in the status of Russian currency within Mongolia’s markets. Having been an illegal commodity in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, Russian ruble grew to become a recognized tool of mutual settlements at the turn of the twentieth century. The solid status that proceeded from S. Witte’s successful financial reform made it possible for the Russian currency to hold a firm place in the financial market of Mongolia, which it turn had most favorable impacts on Russia-Mongolia trade cooperation.",2024-01-21,
Research On LSTM-Based Pricing Strategy for Vegetable Category Wholesale Price Prediction and Multi-Objective Planning,"Fresh vegetable products constitute an indispensable facet of both daily life and the developmental trajectory of the food industry. Owing to the susceptibility to damage and spoilage, vegetable commodities frequently engender substantial financial losses for food retail establishments. This paper addresses the replenishment and pricing decision problem for vegetable commodities and proposes a solution based on goal programming and LSTM time series forecasting models. Firstly, historical data analysis reveals a linear or logarithmic correlation between vegetable sales volume and cost-plus pricing. Subsequently, an LSTM neural network model is employed to forecast wholesale vegetable prices for the upcoming week. Building upon the forecasted results, a multi-objective programming model is established with the objective of maximizing revenue, utilizing daily replenishment total and pricing as decision variables. The model takes into account the constrained relationship between sales volume and pricing, as well as the lower limit constraint on wholesale prices. Additionally, the paper solves the programming model using the least squares method to determine the optimal daily replenishment quantity and pricing for each vegetable category. Finally, the computational results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in guiding replenishment and pricing decisions for supermarkets, achieving revenue maximization. This study provides a feasible quantitative decision-making solution for supermarkets facing complex replenishment and pricing issues.",2024-01-20,
"A proposed Bay-Salam with Takaful and value chain model for financing agriculture in Kano State, Nigeria","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a model that will demonstrate how the integration of Salam (exclusive agricultural commodity trade) with Takaful (micro-Takaful – a subdivision of Islamic insurance) and value chain can address major challenges facing the agricultural sector in Kano State, Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach The study conducted a thorough and critical analysis of relevant literature and existing models of financing agriculture in Nigeria to come up with the proposed model. Findings The findings indicate that measures undertaken to address the major challenges fail. In view of this, this study proposed Bay-Salam with Takaful and value chain model to solve a number of challenges such as poor access to financing, poor marketing and pricing, delay, collateral requirement and risk issues in order to avail farmers with easy access to finance and provide effective security to financial institutions. Research limitations/implications The paper is limited to using secondary data. Therefore, empirical investigation can be carried out to strengthen the validation of the model. Practical implications The study outcome seeks to improve the productivity of the farmers through enhancing their access to finance. This will increase their level of production and provide more employment opportunities. In addition, it will boost financial inclusion, income generation, poverty alleviation, standard of living, food security and overall economic growth and development. Originality/value The novelty of this study lies in the integration of classical Bay-Salam with Takaful and value chain and create a unique model structure which the researchers do not come across in any research that presented it in Nigeria.",2024-01-18,
Integrating health intervention into existing program structure of the neglected tropical diseases: lessons learned from Yobe and Ebonyi states,"Background Nigeria has a national policy on neglected tropical diseases (NTD) which is coordinated by the Federal Ministry of Health and integrated into the health system at all government levels. A network of grassroots mobilizers, named community drug distributors (CDDs), deliver NTD drugs and commodities to rural and hard-to-reach communities throughout Nigeria. Methods Interviews with state and local government coordinators of Nigerian NTD programs and focus group discussions with CDDs in Yobe and Ebonyi states were conducted to understand the working modalities of NTD programs in Nigeria to identify the potential of leveraging the NTD structure for additional health interventions such as COVID-19 vaccine rollouts. Collected data was coded and managed on NVivo version 12 using content analysis. Results and discussion The study found that the NTD committee had the following: a structured planning and coordination process, a community mobilization approach for the effective delivery of routine Mass Administration of Medication (MAM) activities. Challenges encountered included little or no incentives for the CDDs, insecurity, transportation and logistics, and lack of equipment and drug commodities. Nigerian NTD health structures have a wide reach, with a presence in all states and local government areas (LGAs), and this has previously been leveraged to deliver commodities and interventions to rural and hard-to-reach communities for non-NTD health programs and could thus be used similarly for COVID-19 vaccination programs. The enablers of integrating health interventions into the NTD structure are increased availability of finances and manpower, while lack of financial incentives and partners’ buy-in were identified as possible. challenges. Conclusion The study suggests that integrating COVID-19 interventions into the NTD program in Nigeria would be a significant accomplishment, as the existing structure can support future interventions. The study also highlights the efficiency of the NTD program’s modalities and processes, indicating that an organized structural system for public health interventions can. increase the services of existing interventions while allowing for the integration of future interventions.",2024-01-17,
Forecasting food price inflation during global crises,"Abstract In this paper, we consider the forecasting of domestic food price inflation (DFPI) using global indicators, with emphasis on episodes of macroeconomic turbulence, namely, the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the COVID‐19 pandemic and its subsequent repercussions. Our monthly dataset covers about two decades for more than a hundred economies. We employ dynamic model averaging (DMA) to tackle both model uncertainty and parameter instability and produce pseudo out‐of‐sample forecasts. Thus, we are able to focus on the forecasting ability of the global predictors of DFPI before and during the global crises. We find evidence that the DMA specification tends to outperform statistical models frequently used in the literature such as random walks, autoregressive models, and time‐varying parameter models, especially during global crises. We also identify the most successful predictors during the crises using their posterior probabilities of inclusion. By comparing the distributions of such probabilities, we find that the international food price inflation is the most useful predictor of DFPI for numerous countries during both crises. Other indicators such as domestic CPI inflation as well as the international inflation of agricultural commodities, fertilizers, and other food categories improved their forecasting ability, particularly during the COVID‐19 period.",2024-01-17,
The availability of plasma donors and plasma: A sociologist's perspective,"Plasma donations are essential for producing plasma-derived medicinal products (PDMPs) to treat chronic diseases or critical conditions of patients [1]. As such, plasma is an important resource and brings health value to patients. Currently, about 35%–40% of the European plasma need is collected abroad, mostly in the USA from paid donors [2]. Due to current and emerging social, geopolitical, or economic challenges, plasma, regarded as an important raw material and 'strategic resource' is at risk of supply interruption [1-3], leading to a lack of essential products for European patients. Importantly, plasma is not a commodity; it is given by human donors. Donating blood (products) has often been referred to as 'gift of life' [4-6]. Blood for transfusion and plasma for PDMP production are not available without donors. In Europe alone, millions of patients are annually treated with blood products from voluntary donors. In most European countries, high-quality and well-functioning health care systems guarantee access to health care, and usually sufficient and suitable blood products are available. However, donor numbers have been decreasing while the demand for specific blood products, that is, plasma is ever increasing [2, 7]. Declining donor numbers together with the danger of supply interruption through political turmoil and a complex market of pharmaceutical products increase the risk of regional PDMP shortages. Many countries aim to achieve strategic independence in terms of PDMP availability. Therefore, a balanced and sufficient supply, based on large enough donor pools, better-regulated PDMP procurement, international collaborations and donations based on health solidarity is crucial [2, 8]. Enough plasma donations by voluntary donors are one step towards achieving sufficient supply. To understand, explain and influence donation, studies have proposed different groups of determinants [9], including demographic characteristics [10], biological make-up, psychological mechanisms, such as reciprocity and reputation [11], and social network characteristics [12, 13]. Yet, previous research remained fragmented across disciplines and current theories fail to capture the complexity and dynamics of changing motivations and life course circumstances that determine donation [14, 15]. I suggest a life course approach to donor behaviour. The life course approach is a well-established framework in sociology for studying behaviour [16]. It examines individual determinants, links life stages over time and, importantly, examines behaviour within social networks and cultural contexts. Several reviews have indicated the lack of research into the topic of contextual and social network influences on donation behaviour. Especially when it comes to encouraging donations, institutional and sociocultural context are paramount [10, 17]. Cultural contexts set social norms for societies, that is, informal rules that guide and/or constrain social behaviours and determine how acceptable a given behaviour is viewed by members of a society or group [18] while institutions (i.e. plasma collection establishments) can direct specific policies to encouraging donation, such as recruitment messages and various forms of incentives, including, for example, time off work or financial incentives [19]. In 2000, Kieran Healy, in his seminal paper [20] on the role of the institutional context of blood establishments for donor motivation and donation rates, found interesting differences between Red Cross, hospital and state blood banks. He argued that collection regimes produce their own donor populations by their different structural and institutional opportunities and barriers. Although this paper mainly analysed whole blood donations, a similar reasoning can be applied to the structural and institutional opportunities and barriers for plasma donation. In Europe, such structural and institutional factors include, among others, different market situations, for example, monopolies compared to fragmented markets and not-for profit compared to for-profit collectors. Different markets are closely linked to specific incentive structures to motivate, recruit and retain plasma donations [21]. Taken together, this means that in addition to individual determinants, such as altruistic values and intentions, donation behaviour should be understood within the social and cultural contexts where it occurs, including incentive structures, social norms, market settings and (inter)national policymaking. Incentives aim to motivate individuals to behave in a certain way and are generally considered effective tools for encouraging behaviour [19]. Beneficial health behaviours, such vaccination or screening attendance, have been shown to be positively impacted by (monetary) incentives, especially for the short term [22]. However, the surprisingly inconsistent effects of (monetary) incentives on giving behaviour, for example, tax breaks for charity donations and rewards for blood donors remain puzzling [19]. This raises the question for European policymakers if and how incentives can be used to increase plasma donation. Incentives can come either as monetary or non-monetary. Monetary incentives take the form of direct cash payment, vouchers, travel compensations or tax breaks, whereas non-monetary incentives include gifts (e.g., mugs and towels), on-site refreshments, time off work or health checks [19, 21, 23]. To shed light on the diverse landscape of incentives and their potential effect on recruiting and retaining donors across different cultural, structural and institutional contexts, we recently conducted two studies [19, 21]. We first took stock of incentives across several hundred organizations in 26, mainly European, countries and found a large variety of incentive strategies for recruiting and rewarding plasma donors in Europe [21]. While snacks and health checks are commonly provided by nearly all countries, loyalty programmes, small gifts, coupons, lotteries, travel compensations and time off work expand the incentive portfolio. Only in seven countries, with commercial plasma collectors, donors are provided with financial incentives ranging from the equivalent of 10 to 35 Euros [2, 21]. Second, in an effort to explain inconsistencies in the effects of incentives, we proposed that social norms about blood donation, that is, how acceptable the general public regards incentives for blood (product) donation. We examined the donation behaviour of 26,000 individuals from 28 European countries and found that social norms can indeed predict how incentives, either in the form of financial payments or time off work, relate to individual-level blood donation behaviour [19]. Non-monetary incentives as time off work are associated with higher levels of donation if they align with existing social norms of acceptance. Hence, humans may not be universally persuaded by incentives to donate, but the effectiveness of incentives depends on social norms in the given cultural and institutional context. Taken together, different incentives have different effects in different contexts [19]. This illustrates the diversity of donors, institutions, regulators and states, indicating the importance of accounting for sociocultural and institutional embedding of donors and not thinking of balancing supply and demand from an economic perspective only. The ethical question of whether it is desirable to offer incentives for what we often consider an act of altruism and solidarity has repeatedly been raised [24-27], with arguments against donor compensation showing limited basis in scientific evidence [26, 28]. Monetary incentives for blood donors may crowd out altruistic motivations, exploit vulnerable donors [2] and jeopardize blood safety [29] because they might decrease donor compliance with eligibility criteria that determine whether the donation is safe for donor and patient. However, improved testing for infectious disease markers has developed and improved such that infections in transfusion recipients, while not absent, have been minimized. For PDMPs, many pathogen-reduction steps during manufacture have increased safety considerably [30]. At the same time, there is increasing worry that too frequent plasma donation takes a toll on donor health [31-33], especially in the context of paid donors with a call for high-quality and systematic evidence based on international criteria [33]. The recent debate, for example, around European policymaking about the new regulation on substances of human origin is clear on endorsing the importance of donor safety, the principle of voluntary non-remunerated donations, but allows donor appropriate compensation and reimbursement of donors in line with national legislations. Yet, 'appropriate' donor compensation and reimbursement remain a controversial issue. Would it be bad to incentivize donors in controlled, responsible and socially accepted ways when that means that we can beat scarcity of source plasma for life-saving therapies while still protecting donor health and integrity? What kind of empirical evidence do we need to inform our policy decisions? What should the balance be among individual autonomy, effort compensation, availability of plasma but dependence on imported resources from paid donors, risk of exploitation and commodification of substances of human origin? These considerations and previously presented empirical results are complex. Therefore, I suggest an ongoing open dialogue between different scientific disciplines, policymakers, potential donors and all other stakeholders about their responsibilities towards a safe and sufficient plasma supply. Such a dialogue also includes educational efforts and creating awareness about the importance of plasma donation and associated different and sometimes conflicting interests. Future research should attend to the socially embedded nature of altruistic and self-interested action. Importantly, we also need a better understanding of the role of professionals, institutions, companies, and countries and how they may redirect their strategies of recruitment, compliance and retention. In combination, an open debate with the general public, including (potential) donors, patients and professionals and scientific rigour in research can help to shed light on existing empirical inconsistencies and sentiments around the provision of incentives for frequent plasma donors and ultimately lead to a better understanding of donor behaviour, more plasma, a better supply and demand balance, and global health solidarity.

"Uncertainty, stock and commodity prices during the Ukraine-Russia war","This article mainly investigates whether the war in Ukraine-Russia induces uncertainties and how this affects the returns of world stock market indices and commodity prices. To do so, we use the Economic Policy Uncertainty index (EPU), 96 stock market indices and the price of 67 commodities worldwide over the period from January 2022 to April 2023. Our empirical results show that the war between Ukraine and Russia increases uncertainties, and which negatively affect the performance of global financial markets and lead to higher commodity prices. These negative shocks tend to be smaller the longer the war persists. We also observe that responses to war-induced uncertainties are stronger in Europe and America. Overall, we provide unique evidence of the impact of war on uncertainties and how this is transmitted to stock market performance and commodity prices.",2024-01-15,
"The nexus between the volatility of Bitcoin, gold, and American stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from VAR-DCC-EGARCH and ANN models","Abstract The spread of the coronavirus has reduced the value of stock indexes, depressed energy and metals commodities prices including oil, and caused instability in financial markets around the world. Due to this situation, investors should consider investing in more secure assets, such as real estate property, cash, gold, and crypto assets. In recent years, among secure assets, cryptoassets are gaining more attention than traditional investments. This study compares the Bitcoin market, the gold market, and American stock indexes (S&amp;P500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, the dynamic conditional correlation exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model was used to estimate the DCC coefficient and compare this model with the artificial neural network approach to predict volatility of these markets. Our empirical findings showed a substantial dynamic conditional correlation between Bitcoin, gold, and stock markets. In particular, we observed that Bitcoin offered better diversification opportunities to reduce risks in key stock markets during the COVID-19 period. This paper provides practical impacts on risk management and portfolio diversification.",2024-01-15,
Supply chain divergence challenges a ‘Brussels effect’ from Europe's human rights and environmental due diligence laws,"Abstract Human rights violations and pressing environmental issues have tainted agricultural trade. The role of international market demand for commodities such as soy in causing those problems is clear, yet they remain mostly unaddressed. Therefore, European countries have led a new global trend on mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence (HREDD), advancing the EU's growing global regulatory ambitions. Here, we analyse the prospects for successful externalisation of Europe's sustainability standards – a ‘Brussels Effect’ – using Brazilian soy as a case. Our analysis exposes how the practice of supply chain divergence (i.e., the segmentation of exports tailored to different consumer requirements) can easily evade policy impacts and negate their additionality where Europe commands a minor market share. To avoid becoming just a niche market in these cases, the EU would need to expand on its actions, (i) engaging with other major consumer countries to export its standards, (ii) doubling down on HREDD's coverage to include financial actors and companies trading with other markets, or (iii) moving beyond ‘do no harm’ policies to adopt more strategically targeted ‘do good’ instruments to counter drivers of deforestation on the landscape level.",2024-01-14,
Sungai Lembing’s green tourism: Pioneering the future of resource-based urban renewal,"Sungai Lembing, a resource-based town situated in Pahang, Malaysia, has historically positioned itself as a pivotal hub in the global tin mining sector. Geologically, Sungai Lembing's history dates back to the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. These eras were marked by the closure of the Tethyan Ocean and the convergence of continental landmasses from the eastern part of the Gondwana continent. This complex geological background resulted in a wide variety of mineral resources. The collision of tectonic plates is believed to have led to the creation of Sungai Lembing's tin-rich soil.1Du G. Yang X. Cao J. et al.Genesis and timing of the sungai lembing tin deposit in Pahang, East Malaysia: constraints from LA–ICP–MS zircon and cassiterite U–Pb dating, geochemical compositions and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopes.Ore Geol. Rev. 2020; 119103364https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2020.103364Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar The discovery of the world's most extensive underground tin mines in the late 19th century not only propelled the town into the global spotlight but also catalyzed a dramatic economic transformation.2Zulfahmi A.R. Zuhairi W. Raihan M.T. et al.Influence of amang (tin tailing) on geotechnical properties of clay soil.Sains Malays. 2012; 41: 303-312https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22428867Google Scholar The influx of investors and miners led to a proliferation of new economic activities in the region, ranging from trading to the development of infrastructure. The rapid emergence of infrastructure, including transport and processing facilities, not only improved tin extraction and export but also reshaped the town's landscape and daily life. However, mirroring the volatile nature of commodities, Sungai Lembing's prosperity was not destined to last. Due to global market shifts and a decrease in demand, the mid-1980s witnessed a sharp plummet in tin prices. By 1986, this downturn forced the once-thriving mines of Sungai Lembing to halt operations, casting a shadow of financial uncertainty over the town.3Alshaebi F.Y. Yaacob W.Z.W. Samsudin A.R. et al.Risk assessment at abandoned tin mine in sungai lembing, Pahang, Malaysia.Electron. J. Geotech. Eng. 2009; 14: 1-9https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279593033Google Scholar In addition to facing financial instability, the Sungai Lembing tin mine had long employed mining techniques akin to the stope caving method, relying on traditional track mining equipment such as manually operated drills for their operations (https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/05/485428/good-old-days-sg-lembing). These practices led to significant environmental degradation and geological hazards, severely damaging the local vegetation and disrupting the ecosystem. The loss of vegetation, a cornerstone of the local ecosystem, led to increased soil erosion and a heightened risk of landslides. Furthermore, the environmental degradation diminished the natural beauty of the area and adversely affected the well-being and quality of life for the community. Addressing these environmental and safety challenges is essential for restoring the region's ecological balance and ensuring a sustainable future for Sungai Lembing's community. Sungai Lembing has demonstrated remarkable resilience, confronting the twin challenges of economic recessions and environmental degradation with unyielding fortitude. As the 20th century drew to a close, the town's leadership and community agencies initiated efforts to mitigate the environmental damage resulting from decades of mining activities.4Ang L.H. Problems and prospects of afforestation on sandy tin tailings in Peninsular Malaysia.J. Trop. For. Sci. 1994; 87: 105https://www.jstor.org/stable/43581794Google Scholar This strategic pivot not only focused on mitigating the environmental impact but also steered the economy toward a burgeoning green tourism sector, leveraging the town's natural landscapes and cultural heritage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sungai_lembing). Sungai Lembing's dedication to ecological restoration took shape through a comprehensive reforestation initiative, targeting more than just cosmetic changes. This effort aimed to restore indigenous vegetation, stabilize erosion-prone soil, and encourage the return of wildlife, reflecting a deep commitment to healing the landscape. Alongside ecological restoration, Sungai Lembing also sought economic revival by embracing its mining heritage. The town transformed historical mining sites into cultural exhibits, thereby integrating its rich history into a new economic framework. This reimagined identity invites travelers to form a deep bond with the land, allowing them to immerse themselves in its rich history and cultural legacy (please see Figure 1). Sungai Lembing has remarkably transitioned from a mining-centric locale to an exemplary model of rejuvenation, emphasizing environmental rehabilitation and a shift toward green tourism. Unlike many resource-based locales with their own success narratives, Sungai Lembing's approach is distinguished by its strategic focus on preserving and leveraging its natural resources for sustainable development. Sungai Lembing stands as a testament to the possibility of harmonizing economic development with ecological stewardship, offering valuable lessons for similar communities globally. Sungai Lembing demonstrated clarity in charting its transformative journey, with strong government support and community resolve. In 1988, just a year after the Pahang state government ceased operations at the Sungai Lembing tin mine, an ambitious pivot toward ecotourism was proposed. Capitalizing on its rich heritage, Sungai Lembing has skillfully preserved numerous cultural landmarks from the early 20th century, turning its mining sites into a narrative of the town's tin mining saga (https://www.penang-insider.com/sungai-lembing-things-to-do/#google_vignette). These heritage sites, along with the town's picturesque landscapes and pristine natural attractions such as the Rainbow Waterfall, captivate a diverse audience, ranging from enthusiasts of Malaysia's mining history to international nature lovers. Drawing from Sungai Lembing's journey, other resource-based locales can harness their unique attributes to develop a well-defined vision and strategic plan for their future. Sungai Lembing illustrates the balance between human endeavors and environmental conservation in green tourism. In charting its new economic trajectory, the town meticulously incorporated ecological restoration initiatives, such as implementing measures to mitigate the effects of residual mining waste.5Eker H. Investigation of the usability of industrial mining wastes in agriculture.Front. Environ. Sci. 2023; 111248188https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1248188Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar This balanced approach not only rejuvenated the town's natural landscapes but also provided a simultaneous boost to the local economy. The town prioritized environmental considerations rather than sidelining them in pursuit of economic growth. They recognized that a thriving environment can, in turn, foster economic vitality. This cyclical strategy, where environmental conservation fuels economic gains, and vice versa, demonstrates a sustainable growth model worthy of emulation. It calls upon these regions to proactively recalibrate their development strategies, focusing on the lasting benefits of sustainable growth over transient economic advantages. At its core, communities that equally value economic and environmental targets set themselves on a path toward a future that is both prosperous and sustainable. The evolution of Sungai Lembing is a narrative of steadfast commitment. For over three decades since the mine's closure in 1986, the town has unwaveringly pursued a vision to transition from its mining legacy to a hub of green tourism. This journey of transformation has been marked by a clear strategy and an unflinching resolve to eschew quick fixes in favor of long-term sustainability. In the process, Sungai Lembing has become a paragon for environmental conservation and economic revitalization. Its perseverance in nurturing a tourism industry that celebrates its unique mining heritage has not only reinvigorated the local economy but has also redefined its identity. Sungai Lembing's story is one of resilience, highlighting the benefits of steadfast commitment, a clear vision, and the patience to realize it. As such, Sungai Lembing serves as an inspiring example for communities globally, demonstrating the fruitful outcomes achievable through unwavering commitment to a greener and more sustainable future. Sungai Lembing's transformation from a mining-centric economy to a model of green tourism offers a valuable roadmap for resource-based localities aiming for a sustainable future. The foundation of this study lies in three key pillars: strategic planning, active community involvement, and committed environmental stewardship, each playing a pivotal role in driving successful economic transitions. This journey, spanning three decades, showcases the power of unwavering commitment to ecological conservation and the innovative repurposing of cultural heritage. For communities facing similar challenges, the lesson is unequivocal: a long-term vision focused on environmental and economic sustainability trumps the allure of short-term economic boons. In conclusion, the Sungai Lembing case study serves as a harbinger of hope and a strategic guide for like-minded communities worldwide with similar challenges. It affirms that by combining visionary leadership, active community engagement, and persistent dedication, it is feasible to strike a harmonious balance between robust economic development and environmental integrity. This case underscores the practicality of achieving a harmonious balance between robust economic development and the preservation of environmental integrity, offering a model for sustainable progress.

Risks to the outlook in LMICs include elevated geopolitical tensions, a heightened risk of financial stress, persistent inflation, and weaker external demand. These downside risks, if they materialize, could result in even more subdued economic activity, including (1) an escalation of geopolitical tensions, which could adversely affect LMICs through disruptions in commodity markets and fragmentation of trade and financial links; (2) increased borrowing costs in LMICs; (3) persistent inflation in both high-income economies and LMICs, which could lead to even tighter monetary policy and further depress economic activity; and (4) weakening long-term growth expectations.

States of Australia’s agri-environment: visual extractions from degraded landscapes,"Under perpetual growth-geared economic, governance and sociocultural systems, continued increases in agricultural output are necessary to feed an ever-expanding human population, as well as neoliberal appetites for financial profitability. These translate to intensifying and expanding agri landscapes. Yet agribusiness industries routinely seek to obfuscate visual tangibility of their production practices and impacts from public view. A gap exists in public availability of high-resolution imagery depicting Australian agriculture's industrial scales, degraded lands and landscape impacts. This visualisation endeavour is situated between the blurry and pixelated resolution of freely available agricultural satellite imagery, and agri- marketings' frequently glossy, colour-saturated and romanticised depictions from on-ground photography and video. Positioned between these two purviews, the drone-eye-view provides sharp and incisive imagery contributing new insights into agri- landscapes and practices. This visual essay draws from drone imagery captured during continental-scale field research spanning all Australian states and territories, all commodities and major industries, and all scales of commercial farming. As Australian agribusiness is landscape and resource extractive in its geometric pattern arrays, transmuted images are extricated from aerial stills and videos into compositional strips. Together with the poetic and interpretative text, the work reveals industrial and degraded landscapes at nested scales, links foods with their production contexts, and is suggestive of the state of Australia's agricultural environment.",2024-01-11,
Spillover Effects between Crude Oil Returns and Uncertainty: New Evidence from Time-Frequency Domain Approaches,"This paper examines the extent to which uncertainty in the energy market, the financial market, the commodity market, the economic policy, and the geopolitical events affect crude oil returns. To consider the complex properties of time series, such as nonlinearity, temporal variability, and unit roots, we adopt a two-instrument technique in the time–frequency domain that employs the DCC-GARCH (1.1) model and the Granger causality test in the frequency domain. This allows us to estimate the dynamic transmission of uncertainty from various sources to the oil market in the time and frequency domains. Significant dynamic conditional correlations over time are found between oil returns—commodity uncertainty, oil returns—equity market uncertainty, and oil returns—energy uncertainty. Furthermore, at each frequency, the empirical results demonstrate a significant spillover effect from the commodity, energy, and financial markets to the oil market. Additionally, we discover that sources with high persistence volatility (such as commodities, energy, and financial markets) have more interactions with the oil market than sources with low persistence volatility (economic policy and geopolitical risk events). Our findings have significant ramifications for boosting investor trust in risky energy assets.",2024-01-09,
The Effect of Availability of Foreign Exchange and Devaluation of Birr on the Performance of Companies in Ethiopia (Instance of Sample Company),"When a country devalues its currency, some firms and countries generally benefit from any resulting changes in relative prices, while other firms and countries are relatively unaffected or suffer a loss in competitiveness. By taking a sample of import and export firms, this study assessed the effect availability of foreign currency and devaluation of birr on performance of firms in Ethiopia in general. More specifically it intended to assess the main challenges to access foreign currencies, assess the effects of foreign currency shortage on import/export firms, assess the effects of devaluation of Birr on import/export firms and assess company-specific factors. The study used both primary (collected through questionnaire) and secondary data collected from financial statements of the companies. This study applies both the descriptive and inferential analysis. After detail analysis, the increase in private driven business, Informal channels of inflow of foreign currency, increased population and Corruption will worsen appropriate use of forex and aggravate challenges of shortage of forex. And also it is found that the foreign currency shortage has affected the firms in many ways such as profit loss, lay off employees and discourages new investment. On the other hand devaluation of birr against the foreign currencies makes Ethiopian commodities to be competitive in international markets. And it can also attract new investments and export.",2024-01-09,
Realized volatility spillovers between energy and metal markets: a time-varying connectedness approach,"Abstract This paper analyzes the degree of dynamic connectedness between energy and metal commodity prices in the pre and post-COVID-19 era, using the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive connectedness approach of Antonakakis et al. (J Risk Financ Manag 13(4):84, 2020). The results suggest that market interconnectedness increased slightly following the outbreak of COVID-19, although this increase was lower and less persistent than that observed after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Furthermore, we find that crude oil was the main net transmitter of shocks before COVID-19 while heating oil, gold, and silver were the main net transmitters of shocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, natural gas and palladium were the main net receivers of shocks during the entire sample period, making these two commodities attractive hedging and safe haven options for investors during the pandemic. Overall, our results suggest that hedging and diversification opportunities decrease during crises. Furthermore, they indicate that accurate forecasts of the volatility of several commodities, such as natural gas and different metals, can be obtained by exploiting the information content of crude oil. However, they also reveal that crude oil lost its leading position as a net shock transmitter during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2024-01-08,
"Somalia Economic Update, Eighth Edition: Integrating Climate Change with Somalia’s Development: The Case for Water","Somalia has remained on a strong economic reform path despite the various global and exogenous shocks that have continued to buffet the economy. Recurrent climate-related shocks, such as cycles of droughts, floods, locusts’ infestation, higher international commodity prices, as well as increased insecurity and conflict, have interrupted the country’s growth trajectory. However, this has not deterred the country’s commitment to continue advancing reforms to strengthen key economic institutions and promote macroeconomic stability and recovery. As a result, Somalia has continued to make progress toward meeting the conditions for achieving the heavily indebted poor country (HIPC) completion point in December 2023. Within the framework of resilience, the eighth edition of the World Bank’s Somalia economic update series provides an in-depth analysis of recent economic developments and growth outlook and makes a case for integrating climate change with Somalia’s growth agenda. This report highlights macroeconomic policies and reforms that promote inclusive growth and institutional building including enhancing fiscal space for development priorities while strengthening expenditure controls; strengthening financial integrity; integrating Somalia into the global financial system; and improving debt management.",2024-01-08,
Causal relation and volatility spillover between commodity market and equity market of India using VAR Granger Causality and BEKK-GARCH Model,"The financial markets play a discerning role in accentuating the growth of industry and commerce whereas, a volatile market has whopping reverberations on economic and financial stability of a country. The interconnectedness and reciprocity among the financial markets in economies are veraciously liable for the pricing of securities and provide investors, hedgers and speculators with copious opportunities for portfolio diversification. In this context, the study has been taken up to explore the relationship between the commodity and stock markets of India. The study has used the daily closing prices of MCX iComdex composite index, BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 index from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2022. The Johansen’s cointegration test estimates the absence of cointegration between the indices under study. The results of VAR Granger Causality Tests substantiate a bi-directional causality between the equity and commodity market of India. Whereas, it refutes any causal relationship between the Sensex and Nifty index. The estimates of BEKK-GARCH model confirm a significant volatility spillover between the two markets. The empirical outcomes of the study have poignant implications for all the stakeholders such as individual and institutional investors, policymakers, government agencies, traders, hedgers and other participants in the financial markets.",2024-01-06,
Corporate information system for exchange rate analysis and commodity money forecasting,"An intelligent web portal for analysing and forecasting the exchange rate of commodity money has been developed. The result of this research is a comprehensive system that allows for the analysis of the commodity money market, including price forecasting and risk assessment. The study identified the prophet method for predicting the exchange rate of a commodity unit and the monte carlo method for predicting the value of an investment portfolio with various assets. These methods allow us to reliably determine future trends based on the analysis of available data. To implement the web portal, we used the streamlit framework, which allows us to quickly develop interactive web applications using machine learning and data analysis tools.

The yfinance library was also used to retrieve financial data from the Yahoo Finance web service.",2024-01-05,
Does the financialization of agricultural commodities impact food security? An empirical investigation,"The financialization of agricultural commodities and its impact on food security has become an increasing concern. This study empirically investigates the role of financialization in global food markets and its policy implications for a stable and secure food system. Using panel data regression models, moderating effects models, and panel regression with a threshold variable, we analyze wheat, maize, and soybean futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. We incorporate data on annual trading volume, open interest contracts, and their ratio. The sample consists of five developed countries (United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany) and seven developing countries (China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand), covering the period 2000 to 2021. The Human Development Index (HDI) serves as a threshold variable to differentiate the impact across countries. Our findings indicate that the financialization of agricultural commodities has negatively affected global food security, with wheat and soybean showing a greater adverse impact than maize. The effects are more pronounced in developing countries. Additionally, we find that monetary policy has the potential to mitigate these negative effects. These results provide insights for policymakers to design strategies that ensure a secure and accessible global food supply.",2024-01-04,
Impact of terror on international trade in financial services: Does the development of financial institutions matter?,"Abstract We examine the impact of terror on international trade in financial services and the role of financial institutions in alleviating this impact. Using a sample of 67 countries from 2000 to 2020, we find that a 10% increase in the number of terrorist incidents in the importer and/or the exporter results, on average, in a 1.77–2.05% annual reduction in their bilateral financial service trade which is more economically significant than what has been documented for trade in commodities. Top exporters and importers of financial services, however, are less affected by the incidence of terrorism. Confirming the critically important role of systemic stability, we further find that financial institutions' stability (measured by the Z score) is the most powerful factor in mitigating the detrimental impact of terrorism on trade. There is also some limited evidence that exporting countries where financial institutions exhibit more efficiency (measured as the ratio of overhead costs to total assets) cope better with terrorism.",2024-01-04,
Detection of Fake Products Using Blockchain,"Manufacturing and selling of counterfeit items and goods endangers end consumers' financial, health, and safety. Additionally, it affects the economic expansion of original manufacturers and businesses through revenue loss, product slander, downtime, replacement costs, the need for brands to spend money fending off counterfeits, sales theft, etc. To combat these critical counterfeiting consequences, a blockchain-based system is utilized to identify original items and detect forged products to secure the identification of genuine commodities. Any application that uses Blockchain technology as its foundation architecture assures that its data is tamper-proof. The product's QR code is linked to a block chain in order to preserve product information and guaranteed unique codes as blocks in the database, and fake items are detected using a camera scanner. If the codes match, the consumer will receive a notice attesting to the authenticity of the items; otherwise, they will receive a notice informing them that the product is fake. This technique assures that consumers will not rely solely on retailers to identify whether items are genuine or counterfeit.",2024-01-04,
Analisis Rasio Keuangan dalam Pengukuran Kinerja Keuangan pada Perusahaan Sub-Sektor Rokok,"Research Aims: The cigarette industry is one of the leading segments of various sectors in Indonesia and is one of the largest commodities contributing to Indonesian state revenues obtained from Value Added Tax (PPN), Excise, and local taxes. The purpose of this study was to determine the performance of financial performance as measured by the value of financial ratios, namely profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, activity ratios, and solvency ratios of several companies engaged in the tobacco industry as a sample study. The results of this study revealed that there are some companies that have an increase in the value of financial ratios from year to year, but there are also companies whose value decreases in the following year, this indicates that financial ratios can describe financial performance over time and become a management benchmark in performance evaluation to improve company performance in the future.",2024-01-04,
Carbon price prediction based on a scaled PCA approach,"Carbon price prediction is of great importance to regulators and participants in the carbon trading market. It is the basis for developing policies related to the carbon trading market and stabilizing that market. Considering the numerous factors that influence carbon prices in China, dimensionality reduction is needed to improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency. However, the traditional dimensionality reduction methods fail to fully consider the role of influencing factors, which has certain limitations. In this paper, a new dimensionality reduction method, namely scaled principal component analysis (s-PCA), is employed to improve the prediction accuracy of carbon prices. Firstly, a factor library that influence carbon prices is constructed from three perspectives: technical indicators, financial indicators and commodities indicators. Then, the s-PCA method is used to reduce the dimensionality of factors influencing carbon price. Next, two different methods are used to predict carbon prices, including traditional regression method and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. Finally, the economic value of the s-PCA method is examined by constructing investment portfolios. The empirical results of the Hubei Emissions Exchange show that the s-PCA model outperforms other competing models both in- and out-of-sample. In addition, the LSTM model could improve the performance of the s-PCA model in carbon price prediction. From a market timing perspective, investors can achieve a greater return and a larger Sharpe ratio using the s-PCA method than using other comparative methods and buy-and-hold strategy. Therefore, the s-PCA method is effective and robust in predicting carbon price.",2024-01-02,
Dynamic asymmetric spillovers and connectedness between Chinese sectoral commodities and industry stock markets,"This study investigates the dynamic and asymmetric propagation of return spillovers between sectoral commodities and industry stock markets in China. Using a daily dataset from February 2007 to July 2022, we employ a time-varying vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model to examine the asymmetric return spillovers and dynamic connectedness across sectors. The results reveal significant time-varying spillovers among these sectors, with the industry stocks acting as the primary transmitter of information to the commodity market. Materials, energy, and industrials stock sectors contribute significantly to these spillovers due to their close ties to commodity production and processing. The study also identifies significant asymmetric spillovers with bad returns dominating, influenced by major economic and political events such as the 2008 global financial crisis, the 2015 Chinese stock market crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Furthermore, our study highlights the unique dynamics within the Chinese market, where net information spillovers from the stock market to commodities drive the financialization process, which differs from the bidirectional commodity financialization observed in other markets. Finally, portfolio analysis reveals that the minimum connectedness portfolio outperforms other approaches and effectively reflects asymmetries. Understanding these dynamics and sectoral heterogeneities has important implications for risk management, policy development, and trading practices.",2024-01-02,
The Global Transmission of U.S. Monetary Policy,"This paper studies the transmission of US monetary shocks across the globe by employing a high-frequency identification of policy shocks and large VAR techniques, in conjunction with a large macro-financial dataset of global and national indicators covering both advanced and emerging economies. Our identification controls for the information effects of monetary policy and allows for the separate analysis of tightenings and loosenings of the policy stance. First, we document that US policy shocks have large real and nominal spillover effects that affect both advanced economies and emerging markets. Policy actions cannot fully isolate national economies, even in the case of advanced economies with flexible exchange rates. Second, we investigate the channels of transmission and find that both trade and financial channels are activated and that there is an independent role for oil and commodity prices. Third, we show that effects are asymmetric and larger in the case of contractionary US monetary policy shocks. Finally, we contrast the transmission mechanisms of countries with different exchange rates, exposure to the dollar, and capital control regimes.",2024-01-01,
Do Geopolitical Risks Raise or Lower Inflation?,"Do geopolitical risks raise or lower inflation? Using a unique dataset containing historical macroeconomic data since 1900 for 44 economies, we find that geopoliticalrisks foreshadow high inflation, with the intensity of this effect differing across countries and historical periods. The rise in inflation is accompanied by lower economic activity;an increase in military spending, public debt, and money growth; supply disruptions; and a decline in international trade. Geopolitical risks are also associated with higherinflation uncertainty and the risk of significant inflation increases. Using a monthly VAR model estimated on global data since the 1970s, we confirm that global geopolitical risksincrease inflation, with the inflationary effect of higher commodity prices and currency depreciation more than offsetting the deflationary effects of lower consumer sentimentand tighter financial conditions.",2024-01-01,
"Aflatoxins in food: Prevalence, health effects, and emerging trends in its mitigation—An updated review","Abstract Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by a variety of fungal and mold species. One of the mycotoxin families that is often regarded as the most concerned one in human and animal feeds, is aflatoxin. Aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus species are very toxic and cause significant contamination of food supplies, resulting in serious health repercussions including carcinogenicity. To date, several regulations on aflatoxin permissible level limits have been established in a number of nations. Based on government guidelines and restrictions, consumers and food producers anticipate that aflatoxin contamination in food should not negatively impact human and animal health. Aflatoxin contamination of food commodities poses a consequential risk to humans and is also associated with substantial financial losses. Conventional mycotoxin reduction strategies involve both preventative and decontamination approaches. The present review gives an update on recent research on conventional approaches, including pre‐ and post‐harvest procedures that could potentially be used to decontaminate aflatoxin. Additionally, the current study delves into the source of contamination, global occurrence, impact on human health, and management strategies to assure food security and safety.",2024-01-01,
M $^{3}$ FAS: An Accurate and Robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing System,"Face presentation attacks (FPA), also known as face spoofing, have brought increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data ( <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">e.g.</i> , depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality.

Dynamic Connectedness between Crypto and Conventional Financial Assets: Novel Findings from Russian Financial Market,"In the dynamic landscape of the Russian digital economy and increasing financial openness, crypto assets have emerged as influential players in the financial market. The geopolitical and economic developments after a conflict with Ukraine have presented formidable challenges in the shape of financial and trade sanctions, coupled with the suspension from the SWIFT banking system, has plunged the Russian economy into a precarious situation. The current study delves into the network spillover effects between a prominent crypto asset and various financial assets including equity, exchange rates, crude oil, gold, and commodity futures using daily data from January 01, 2018, to August 31, 2023. The purpose of the study is to provide empirical and theoretical insights into countering the impact of sanctions on Russia, proposing a pragmatic solution for the Russian financial market. The research methodology involves the application of network spillover estimation and value-at-risk analysis. Notably, the findings expose a robust association between crypto and financial assets, where crypto assets play a pivotal role in transmitting risk within the financial landscape. While their impact on other financial assets remains relatively subdued, short-term correlations exhibit volatile fluctuations, often marked by sharp increases in downside risk. Theoretical implications follow the portfolio theory of asset pricing, with extreme risk spillover originating from long-run fluctuations in the crypto market, impacting market sentiment and elevating risk propagation in the Russian financial market. These results carry practical significance for payment and receipt processes, as well as trading activities with foreign countries, presenting essential insights for policymakers and investment decision-makers.",2024-01-01,
The impact of shifts in PEPFAR funding policy on HIV services in Eastern Uganda (2015–21),"Abstract Although donor transitions from HIV programmes are increasingly common in low-and middle-income countries, there are limited analyses of long-term impacts on HIV services. We examined the impact of changes in President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) funding policy on HIV services in Eastern Uganda between 2015 and 2021.We conducted a qualitative case study of two districts in Eastern Uganda (Luuka and Bulambuli), which were affected by shifts in PEPFAR funding policy. In-depth interviews were conducted with PEPFAR officials at national and sub-national levels (n = 46) as well as with district health officers (n = 8). Data were collected between May and November 2017 (Round 1) and February and June 2022 (Round 2). We identified four significant donor policy transition milestones: (1) between 2015 and 2017, site-level support was withdrawn from 241 facilities following the categorization of case study districts as having a ‘low HIV burden’. Following the implementation of this policy, participants perceived a decline in the quality of HIV services and more frequent commodity stock-outs. (2) From 2018 to 2020, HIV clinic managers in transitioned districts reported drastic drops in investments in HIV programming, resulting in increased patient attrition, declining viral load suppression rates and increased reports of patient deaths. (3) District officials reported a resumption of site-level PEPFAR support in October 2020 with stringent targets to reverse declines in HIV indicators. However, PEPFAR declared less HIV-specific funding. (4) In December 2021, district health officers reported shifts by PEPFAR of routing aid away from international to local implementing partner organizations. We found that, unlike districts that retained PEPFAR support, the transitioned districts (Luuka and Bulambuli) fell behind the rest of the country in implementing changes to the national HIV treatment guidelines adopted between 2017 and 2020. Our study highlights the heavy dependence on PEPFAR and the need for increasing domestic financial responsibility for the national HIV response.",2024-01-01,
Global Trade: Long-Term Trends and Structural Changes,"The paper considers long-term trends of global trade and there structural changes. We determine the elasticity of trade to GDP and the dynamics of the ratio of goods and services exports, as well as structural shifts in the major countries and regions of the world. The case study was focused on the USA–China trade relations and contradictions. Since 2007, PRC is the undisputed world’s largest exporter of goods. According to author’s estimates, in 2022 China was ahead of the United States in the total merchandise export by 1.5 trillion dollars. This corresponds to 6.3% of total world exports or 5.8% of US GDP. The trade war unleashed by former president D. Trump administration in 2018–2019 inevitably resulted in a decline in bilateral trade. However, this was just a temporary trend. The recent WTO statistics shows that US imports from China recovered by 2021 both in general volume and in the main categories of goods, both for intermediate and final consumption. Moreover, in 2022 its value, in particular for the analyzed commodity groups (aluminum, iron and steel) exceeded the indicators of 2017–2018. The author argues that, most importantly, there are long-term and fundamental implications of the trade conflict between the US and China rather than a transient decrease in mutual trade between the two flagships of globalization. In particular, it substantially exacerbated the protectionist biases in the international trade policies that became evident after the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. It triggered appearance of new rapidly rising actors at the international trade field such as India and Brazil. This points at major underlying shifts in the global production and supplies schemes. Basically, tensions between the two flagships of globalization produced much higher uncertainty in the global trade which, in the next decade, is unlikely to show the dynamics comparable to that of the period 2002–2008.",2024-01-01,
"Smallholder participation in zero-deforestation supply chain initiatives in the Indonesian palm oil sector: Challenges, opportunities, and limitations","As actors in tropical agricultural commodity supply chains implement commitments to end deforestation, they risk exacerbating social inequities by excluding smallholder farmers, who are important producers of many tropical commodity crops. Here, we explore the potential for independent oil palm smallholders in Indonesia to participate in zero-deforestation supply chains. We find that these smallholders are underrepresented in the share of zero-deforestation compliant oil palm production. We then synthesize perspectives from key actors in the oil palm industry including smallholders and their representatives, palm oil producing and consulting companies, nongovernmental organizations, and academic researchers. Based on these perspectives, we find that challenges to smallholder supply chain participation include limitations in knowledge (e.g., smallholders may not know the location of protected forests), institutional issues (e.g., absence of trust between oil palm growing companies and smallholder farmers), and financial constraints (e.g., the opportunity cost of not clearing forest). To address these shortcomings, we encourage oil palm growing and milling companies to take the lead on incentivizing, supporting, and facilitating smallholder participation in zero-deforestation initiatives. Specifically, these companies could build and use their technical and political resources to identify and map all forests in their entire supply shed and ensure small producers have land rights that enable participation in zero-deforestation supply chains. These policy levers would need to be combined with economic incentives such as access to improved inputs or price premia for their products. However, we caution that smallholder integration into existing zero-deforestation supply chains alone is unlikely to result in significant additional forest conservation at scale in Indonesia due to selection bias, leakage, and existing land tenure norms. Community-led and jurisdictional or landscape-scale supply chain initiatives that acknowledge multi-commodity production are more likely to provide equitable and just avenues for Indonesian smallholder farmers to steward forest resources.",2024-01-01,
Public investment as a growth driver for a commodity-exporting economy: Sizing up the fiscal-monetary involvement,"&lt;abstract&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study presents a solution to maximize public investment as a growth driver for commodity-exporting economies. The solution is to compensate for the low efficiency of public investment by drawing on internal and external factors within an active fiscal and monetary policy framework. For this, the paper introduces a quantitative model that implements a golden rule of public finance in a resource boom backed by a sovereign wealth fund under an active monetary policy stance. The modeling results show that mobilizing windfall resource revenues to finance increased public investment can limit a crowding-out effect through proper resource allocation and change the sectoral structure in favor of the final goods sector. As confirmed by the sensitivity analysis, the low efficiency of public investment can be partially offset by a less restrictive monetary policy response to fiscal dominance, but this leads to excessive volatility in financial indicators. However, if the public debt burden is an issue due to a more robust fiscal dominance regime, a higher tax rate on exported raw materials can be used to maintain sustainability. By developing a policy goals domain, the paper initiates a discussion that can direct policy recommendations toward a promising growth path by maximizing the public investment driver in the complex policy environment of fiscal-monetary interaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;",2024-01-01,
Critique of Reification of Art and Creativity in the Digital Age: A Lukácsian Approach to AI and NFT Art,"Abstract This article critically examines the emergent phenomena of AI-generated and NFT art through the lens of Georg Lukács’ theory of reification and its existential implications. Lukács argued that under capitalism, social relations and human experiences are transformed into objective, quantifiable commodities, leading to a fragmented and alienated consciousness. Applying this framework to AI and NFT art, these technologies can be said to represent extreme examples of the reification of art and creativity in the digital age. AI art generators reduce artistic production to abstract, computable properties divorced from lived experience, while NFTs transform digital art into speculative commodities, imposing the logic of private property and exchange value onto the previously open domain of online culture. The existential dimension of this reification is explored, raising questions about the nature of creativity, originality, and the value of art in an increasingly financialized and automated world. The article suggests that a Lukácsian critique must not only diagnose the reified character of these cultural forms but also identify their potential for resistance and transformation, pointing toward a re-humanized and emancipatory vision of art in the digital age. Contemporary theorists such as Tiziana Terranova, Nick Dyer-Witheford, and Benjamin Noys are invoked to further elucidate these issues.",2024-01-01,
Machine learning Brent crude oil price forecasts,"Forecasts regarding the prices of energy commodities have long been significant to many market players. Our research examines the price of Brent crude oil on a daily basis in order to address the issue. The price series under investigation has significant financial ramifications, and the sample under investigation spans 10 years, from April 7, 2014 to March 28, 2024. In this case, cross-validation procedures and Bayesian optimization approaches are used to construct Gaussian process regression methods, and the resulting strategies are used to generate price estimates. For the out-of-sample evaluation period of March 24, 2022 to March 28, 2024, our empirical prediction technique yields relatively accurate projections of prices, as indicated by the relative root mean square error of 0.2814%. Price prediction models provide governments and investors with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions regarding the crude oil market.",2024-01-01,
Literature review on the consequences of food price spikes and price volatility,"Food price volatility has drawn much attention from the international community in the beginning of the 21st century, in the aftermath of the 2008 and 2010 food riots. One strand of the literature aimed at identifying the economic origins of the increased variability of prices (supply shocks, underinvestment in the agricultural sector, financial speculation and increased demand from the emerging markets), while several articles were trying to assess whether there had actually been a change in the volatility regime in the first place. 
Yet another strand of the literature focused on the consequences of food price shocks and volatility. This paper provides a comprehensive review of this extensive literature on the impacts of food price shocks and food commodity volatility. The consequences are assessed both in micro- and macroeconomic terms, from the consumer’s and producer’s sides, as well as from the theoretical and empirical points of view. If the vast majority of studies points to a detrimental impact of food price shocks on the livelihood of many in the developing world, and on potentially dire consequences on production, growth and political stability, this literature review reveals, above all, the lack of proper investigation about the consequences of food price volatility in itself. The hype around the excessive volatility of the food markets did not translate into an academic focus on the consequences of this price instability.",2024-01-01,
Decentralized Markets and Decentralized Regulation,"Distributed ledger technology such as blockchains is changing the structure of financial markets by creating foundations for transacting with digital assets. Digital assets (and cryptoassets) have evolved to secure blockchains and projects built on them and to help trade digital and real-world assets. Bonds, shares, commodities, and other real-world assets may be tokenized, transferred, and traded on-chain. New blockchain-enabled intermediaries – crypto-exchanges – have emerged to trade, broker, and process transactions with digital assets. These are not merely product and process innovations: through enabling new intermediaries to operate atop base layer protocols, blockchains have become an institutional innovation. U.S. regulators have attempted to pigeonhole the new intermediaries within the remit of existing regulation and registration requirements for legacy exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearinghouses. These legacy intermediaries are either self-regulatory organizations (SROs) or members of SROs, such as FINRA and NFA. Thus, a byproduct of the Commissions' efforts to register the new digital-asset intermediaries is bringing formal self-regulation into blockchain-enabled markets. Unfortunately, in their efforts to impose the SRO model without reform, the SEC and CFTC have ignored the considerable economic potential of blockchains as institutional innovations. This ossified approach seems manifestly contrary to the Commissions' normative objective of promoting efficient innovation that ensures economic growth. It does not mean, however, that the Commissions' intuition of introducing self-regulation is misguided, only that its execution is incomplete. In this Article, I join the scholars who call for self-regulation in blockchain-enabled markets and discuss several arguments for SROs. One is the similarities between the trading microstructure and processes in legacy and digital-asset markets. Blockchain-enabled markets offer institutional and transaction-cost-reducing benefits but are not immune from various new and legacy market risks. Another explanation is that financial regulation requires detailed knowledge of both markets and developing technologies. Designing this regulatory apparatus for fast-paced innovative markets is a massive undertaking. An expert SRO overseen by the Commissions could supply the regulators with necessary information reflecting the dynamic nature of financial technology. Knowledge about developing blockchain-based markets is inherently decentralized. A new expert SRO could approximate decentralized markets, receive inputs from participants, and pass them onto the SEC and CFTC through the rule approval process. In conclusion, I address the design of the new SROs.",2024-01-01,
GLOBAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ROLE OF ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY,"Introduction. An actual stage of the development of the global socio-economic system is the formation of the digital economy. The information basis of the digital economy is accounting and control, which undergo positive changes under the conditions of the use of innovative computer and communication technologies. The transformation of accounting and control takes place through the clarification of their global roles, manifested in the digital economy. The purpose of the article is to highlight and clarify the global role of accounting and control under the influence of the use of computer and communication technologies in the conditions of the formation of the digital economy. Results. In order to assess the readiness of the socio-economic system to implement the principles of the digital economy, an assessment of the country’s innovativeness, the level of implementation of information processing technologies and the digital capacity of the economy was carried out. The results of the ranking of countries by the level of development of the digital economy proved the presence of active obstacles to the digitalization of socio-economic processes, overcoming which involves the optimization of accounting and control systems. Regardless of the national or international features of business, seven global roles of accounting and control in the digital economy are identified: informativeness, integration, communication, institutionality, control, optimization, and protection. accounting and control in the conditions of the formation of the digital economy. It has been proven that a common feature for all global roles of accounting and control in the digital economy is the priority of electronic transactions in the financial and economic activities of enterprises compared to classic monetary and commodity transactions. Conclusions. Only in a socio-economic system with a predominant part of electronic transactions among monetary and commercial operations is it possible to comprehensively activate the above global roles of accounting and control. Highlighting the global roles of accounting and control forms the starting point in the study of the vectors of further digitization of accounting information processing in relation to the digital economy. For the development of a comprehensive understanding of the prospects for the transformation of accounting and control, further scientific research into the substantiation of the impact of computer and communication technologies, which are the basis of the digital economy, on the order of processing accounting information is important.",2024-01-01,
How are Derivative Accounting Applied for Hedging Activities?,"The derivative instruments accounting plays an important role in the development of the financial instruments markets, commodity market and in the risk management process. Because, the close relationship between the methods of derivative instruments accounting and the derivative instruments in the financial markets, commodity market for hedging activities. Moreover, they bring the relevance and reliability of Financial statements. Application of derivative instruments accounting is an essential factor for the development of financial market and economy. Currently, Vietnamese accounting is using historical cost methods for the financial assets; the fair value is not applied by the enterprises. How is difference between the historical method and fair value accounting? If the enterprises apply derivative instruments accounting, how will they have benefits? The article analyses and emphasizes usage of the derivative instruments accounting method and fair value of evaluating models to find out benefits to help managers and investors manage the risk.",2024-01-01,
Fuelling the future : A comparative exploration of energy prices in India and the US,"India’s crude oil consumption is expected to continue to increase, driven by economic growth and rising demand for transportation fuels. This will further boost India’s dependence on imported oil. The U.S. petroleum industry has several strengths, including its large resource base, technological expertise, and its access to capital. This paper analyses the association between economic conditions and the price of Crude Oil in a cross-country setting. The study uses a secondary data series of two prominent nations throughout 2013-2023. The analysis revealed a significant long-term price correlation between natural gas and crude oil, indicating a relationship between the prices of these energy commodities. The ramifications of the study’s conclusions hold significant relevance for investors and politicians. Investors should be aware that the cost of crude oil will likely be higher during economic uncertainty and inflation. Policymakers should also be mindful of Crude Oil’s role in the financial system and take steps to mitigate any potential risks.",2024-01-01,
Countering Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing: A Case for Bitcoin Regulation,"Bitcoin was created in 2008 to serve as an alternative payment mechanism for both the under-banked and un-banked or those in regions where the formal financial system suffers from broad corruption and efficient regulation. However, criminals and terrorists quickly exploited Bitcoin's unique properties, namely its peer-to-peer nature and pseudo-anonymity, to facilitate extensive terrorist financing and money laundering schemes. Government reactions to safeguard national security interests have been extremely varied, ranging from outright bans to passive tolerance. This inconsistency stems from how to classify Bitcoin effectively. On one side are those who argue Bitcoin is a currency, and on the other are those who claim it is a type of asset. In the US alone, these discrepancies have led to a bureaucratic turf war between different regulatory bodies, namely the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Commodity Futures Trading Association, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Internal Revenue Service. This study seeks to move beyond the existing legal frameworks, arguing that Bitcoin should be classified as a technology and regulation should rest with private sector technology companies.",2024-01-01,
Impact of Chinese financial shocks: A GVAR approach,"&lt;abstract&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article analyzes the influence of Chinese financial shocks on emerging and advanced economies using a GVAR (Global Vector Autoregressive) from 1985Q4 to 2016Q4. We summarize our findings in five points: i) adverse shocks in Chinese financial markets can cause a global recession; ii) these shocks trigger the ""flight to quality"", leading to the depreciation of domestic currencies to the U.S. dollar; iii) stock and exchange markets contribute to transmitting the shock to domestic economies; iv) commodity prices are sensitive to these shocks; v) the impact of the Chinese financial shock increased in the new millennium. Finally, the financial system of China has the potential to provoke worldwide macroeconomic fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;",2024-01-01,
Factors influencing effective incorporation of green management techniques in business organization: An comprehensive insight,"Owing to the industrialization, the use of energy and natural resource are increasing exponentially. All products and commodities used day-to-day human life are by-products of natural resources, which are depleted without awareness. Green human resource management (GHRM) is viewed in the context of green management as another aspect of human resource management (HRM), which aims to successfully implement green initiatives in any businesses organization. To upsurge understanding of how GHRM initiatives within businesses can foster environmentally conscious behaviour among workers, with a focus on the mediating function of green innovation (GI) is of utmost concern. On a profound observation, there are numerous implications and unawareness that causes lack or practices of green management in majority of the organizations. This article presents comprehensive review on the predominant external and internal factors to be considered for any small scale, medium scale and large-scale organization for effective adoption of green management technique. Additionally, an exhaustive analysis on value added to firms in terms of social sustainability, economic sustainability and environmental sustainability is elaborated. Nevertheless, there is little research on the relationship between GHRM initiatives and the following business outcomes: financial success, flexibility, and productivity. Indeed, a review article with focus on influencing parameter to be consider for ease of implementation of green management policies will be a critical insight to business firms, government policy makes, social culture in any organization. This review also allies with the sustainable development goals (SDG 08: Decent Work and Economic Growth) and (SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production) as framed by the united nation.",2024-01-01,
Using animal productivity in programming regional agricultural development,"The article discusses the issue of optimizing the process of programming the development of agriculture in terms of livestock breeding based on the potential productivity in dairy cattle breeding. As is known, a significant part of the milk obtained from cows is formed due to the genetic characteristics of the animals. Therefore, the fastest result in increasing productivity can be achieved through the intensification of targeted breeding work. This is precisely what the state needs to focus on when leaving programs for the development of the agro-industrial complex. Increasing the genetic potential of a region (territory) and its use should be the basis for drawing up targeted programs. The purpose of the study is to formulate the concept of the genetic potential of the region and determine the possibility of increasing it through commodity lending. Among the instruments of state support for agriculture, the use of commodity lending in livestock farming will make it possible to quickly disseminate favorable breeding achievements throughout the region. For example, in the Samara region, out of 98.8 thousand heads 29.6 thousand cows belong to the population with low genetic potential (29.9%). According to calculations, with minimal financial investments it is possible to completely replace an unproductive herd in the region.",2024-01-01,
Novel and Old News Sentiment in Commodity Futures Markets,"This study examines the relationship between novel and old news sentiment and commodity futures returns. We find that both novel and old news sentiment are significantly correlated with returns, with old sentiment having a stronger effect. Commodity futures returns are positively associated with positive news sentiment and negatively associated with negative news sentiment for both novel and old news. Moreover, only old news sentiment triggers overreaction on the news day, the effect of which is largely reversed over the next 30 trading days. Furthermore, during periods of high financial stress and uncertainty, old news sentiment has a greater influence on commodity futures returns.",2024-01-01,
Exploring Key Properties and Predicting Price Movements of Cryptocurrency Market Using Social Network Analysis,"The emerging cryptocurrency market is one of the largest financial markets in the world, with a market capitalization that is already surpassing the gross domestic product of many developed economies. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being adopted as a means of transaction and ownership in the digital domain, particularly in areas like decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens. Known for its high volatility, this market offers investors the potential for higher returns than traditional financial markets like stocks, foreign exchange, and commodities. However, it remains underexplored in academic research. In this paper, we propose the use of social network analysis to effectively model and analyze the cryptocurrency market and conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore its key properties, including correlation structure, topological characteristics, stability, and influence. Furthermore, we propose the use of centrality measures as novel indicators to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price movement predictions. Our research introduces a novel method for understanding and navigating the cryptocurrency market, enabling investors to integrate advanced analytical tools into their decision-making processes.",2024-01-01,
Bitcoin Sentiment Index and Asset Classes Connectedness: An International Evidence,"Investor psychology is one of the determinants of asset pricing, according to behavioral finance. The tool of diversification is used for increase returns and avoid risk. In this study, Bitcoin as a new avenue of investment is explored. The main objective of this study is to measure the effect of Bitcoin investors' sentiments on the stock market volatility of different countries worldwide, Such an impact is measured through a newly constructed sentiment index for each sample country. Moreover, the interconnectedness of Bitcoin with other financial assets like equity, bonds, foreign exchange, crude oil, and gold commodities is explored through the proxy of BSI(i). For the sample period of 2014 to 2023 on a daily basis, such interconnectedness/spillover effect is measured through Diebold, Francis X.; Yilmaz, (2010a) and heterogeneous frequency responses to shocks is measured through the model given by Baruník & Křehlík, (2018). The results infer that Bitcoin has qualities like other financial assets and commodities. However, like other assets, bitcoin shows low as well as high correlation and spillover with other assets.",2024-01-01,
China's Footprint in Global Financial Markets,"Using daily data since 2017, we disentangle China-specific structural shocks drivingChinese financial markets and examine spillovers across global markets. The noveltyof this paper consists of simultaneously identifying China shocks with shocksemanating from the United States and shocks to global risk sentiment – two majorforces driving global financial markets – to ensure that China spillover estimates donot reflect common factors. Our results show that shocks originating in China havematerial impacts on global equity markets, although spillovers are much smallerthan those following shocks in the United States, or those triggered by shifts inglobal risk sentiment. By contrast, shocks from China account for a significantproportion of variation in global commodity prices, more on a par with those of theUnited States. Nevertheless, spillovers from China can be significantly amplified inan environment of heightened global volatility, or when the shocks are large.",2024-01-01,
"Illicit Financial Flows, Extractive Sectors, and the Energy Transition: Building State Capacity to Finance the SDGs","States play a crucial role in the capture and allocation of commodity revenues shaping development outcomes. This chapter examines their capacity to address illicit financial flows and better finance development programmes, focusing on energy transition revenues. It first reviews the main findings about state capacity to harness commodity revenues to reach key Sustainable Development Goals. It then explores the complex interplay between state capacity, commodity-based financial flows, and development processes in the context of the energy transition. Highlighting the diversity of state capacities among commodity-dependent countries and possible energy transition trajectories, the chapter discusses opportunities and challenges resulting from changes in the volume, type and price volatility of commodities, and associated illicit financial flows associated with the energy transition. State capacity must anticipate and respond to shifts in dependence on fossil fuels to energy transition minerals and renewable energy production in order to avoid repeating illicit financial flow patterns associated with the ‘resource curse’ and poor development outcomes.",2024-01-01,
"Commodity Price Cycles: Commonalities, Heterogeneities, and Drivers","Abstract. This paper examines commodity price cycles, focusing on key boom-bust episodes in commodity markets. Using a two-step approach that includes a dynamic factor model and a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) model, we analyze common cycles across 39 commodity prices from 1970 to 2022 to identify their underlying drivers. Our findings reveal a global cycle in commodity prices that accounts for 18.3% of the variation, on average, across the 39 series since 2000 (up from 7.7% over the period 1970-1999). The post-2000 synchronized increase in commodity prices, also known as the '2000s commodity super-cycle,' was mainly driven by global supply shocks such as rapid productivity growth in emerging markets like China, indicating that persistent increases in commodity prices are typically driven by underlying structural forces. In contrast, the sharp and widespread price increases in the 2020s were primarily driven by global demand shocks reflecting short-term cyclical drivers such as post-COVID-19 recovery. Commodity-specific shocks—for example, speculative demand shifts in financialized commodity markets in the early 2000s and increased commodity storage demand due to geopolitical tensions post-COVID-19—have further contributed to broad-based price surges during boom periods.",2024-01-01,
Development of Electric Vehicle Charging Tariff Strategy for Indonesian Grid Authority with Real-Time Elasticity Pricing,"In light of the excessive supply of fossil power generation and penetration of intermittent solar Photovoltaic (PV) power, along with the anticipation of power drawn from Electric Vehicle (EV) charging, understanding the electricity markets is essential for suppliers and consumers. Anticipating the fluctuation from the generation and EV charging profiles and forecasting the electricity tariff would benefit the grid authority while providing a fair tariff for the EV owner. However, in addition to the tariff problems, the tariff strategy should encourage efficient grid use, including its various energy sources, without putting undue financial burden on EV owners. Current research has many pricing methods, but they do not consider several variables simultaneously, so the results are still not comprehensive. In this journal, we discuss the development of the Real-Time Elasticity Pricing method, which considers several variables simultaneously and is expected to provide more comprehensive results. This paper aimed to develop an EV electric tariff strategy for Indonesia Grid Authority, embracing the Solar PV integration and Hydrogen Energy Storage System into Java-Bali Power Grid. The real-time electricity tariff is computed and forecasted a day ahead using the Indonesia generation profile, load profile, Solar PV irradiance profile with residential EV owner charging profile, and EV charging scheme. The time-based tariff is analyzed using standard residual deviation within linear regression combined with the market elasticity method. The results reveal that the strategy cannot load-follow hourly, which is exciting and aligns with the nature of EV charging concerning its stochastic behavior and technical specification. Viewing electricity consumption for EV charging in specific schemes of certain groups of hours as distinct commodities could be helpful, as it allows for more precise management and pricing.",2024-01-01,
"Exploring fluctuations and interconnected movements in stock, commodity, and cryptocurrency markets","Abstract This research employs a vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to explore the volatility and dynamic interactions between stock, commodity, and cryptocurrency markets. It focuses on the returns of the S&amp;P 500, gold, crude oil, and Bitcoin to analyse their interconnections. Our results indicate that Bitcoin returns positively affect S&amp;P 500 and crude oil, but negatively impact gold. Conversely, crude oil returns have a positive influence on gold but lead to decreased returns for Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500. Similarly, higher gold returns correspond to increased returns in crude oil and S&amp;P 500 but decreased returns in Bitcoin. The rise of the S&amp;P 500 negatively influences Bitcoin and crude oil returns, while gold returns remain unaffected. However, these relationships exhibit weak and limited strength. Including these assets in a portfolio can help risk mitigation, as Bitcoin diversifies crude oil, gold, and S&amp;P 500, and crude oil diversifies S&amp;P 500. These findings contribute to our understanding of global financial dynamics and inform decision-making in risk assessment, portfolio management, risk mitigation, and diversification strategies.",2024-01-01,
Russia Under the Conditions of Global Economy Regionalization,"Since 2022, Russia has been developing under a major change in the foreign relations with other countries. Building an updated foreign economic strategy requires defining constructive ways to develop trade, scientific and technological relations with the outside world. The exhaustion of globalization potential and the growth of economic power of developing countries provide for a new model of the world economy. This involves its regionalization with the several centers of power emerging and acting as attractors and focal points for the existing and future commodity and financial flows. One center of power will be based on maintaining the high importance of the US economy, in favor of which a part of the income of developed countries will be redistributed. Another center of power will reflect the growing importance of large developing countries. The increasing conflict and protectionism within global economic relations are an inevitable component of the new model above. As of now, Russia’s economic power is insufficient to become a full-fledged center of power. A positive development scenario is associated with intensive scientific and technological development and ensuring national technological achievements reaching the global level. This will provide odds for organic integration into a world-regional system with a friendly center of power and based on production and technological cooperation through effective technology exchange in the fields of energy, security, digital and additive technologies, construction and industrial engineering. Strengthening of the economic potential for external economic cooperation along with maintaining the country’s defense capability are necessary for effective counteraction against the sanctions pressure. The solution is possible only if the high rates of economic growth are maintained accompanied with growing contribution of its drivers associated with the increasing efficiency of using primary resources. For the Russian economy, it is necessary to ensure at least a neutral impact of net exports on economic growth at the stage of structural and technological modernization. In the future, it is necessary to increase the positive contribution of exports to economic growth based on diversification of the range and geography of product deliveries.",2024-01-01,
"Safe Haven Ability of Energy and Agricultural Commodities Against G7 Stock Markets and Banking Indices During COVID‐19, Russia–Ukraine War, and SVB Collapse: Evidence From the Wavelet Coherence Approach","This article assesses the hedging and safe haven properties of energy and agricultural commodities (crude oil, natural gas, and wheat) against the G7 stock market indices and banking sector stock indices during the COVID‐19 pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine military conflict, and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse. Using wavelet coherence analysis, our results showed dynamic correlations in which commodities shifted from diversifiers to strong safe havens during periods of turmoil. Particularly, WTI became a safe haven during the SVB collapse, natural gas acted primarily as a safe haven during the pandemic, and wheat evolved into a robust safe haven during crises. Moreover, our results with the G7 banking sector stock indices underscore the safe haven ability of commodities against these financial assets, furnishing valuable insights for investors during unstable financial situations.",2024-01-01,
Screening Queerness at Beyond the Blue Sky Mongolian Queer Film Festival,"As the only queer film festival in Mongolia, the Beyond the Blue Sky Queer Film Festival is tasked with creating space for queerness in a shifting society. In this essay we situate this distinct film festival within and against the social, political, and economic currents of queerphobic media and representations in rapidly changing Mongolia. We also show how queer Mongolian filmmakers and their audiences respond, contest, and rework these currents, highlighting some of the local films that screened at the festival.Despite its storied history, Mongolia, or Mongol Uls, is a relatively young country still in the process of constructing its national identity. After transitioning to democracy in the 1990s, Mongolia is now seeing a transformation of its entire society: “With the disappearance of the overarching communist ideology that had dictated the political landscape of the country for nearly seven decades . . . symbols and markers of national community are constantly renegotiated and appropriated reflecting fluid relations of power and social order” (Myadar and Rae 2014: 562). “Tradition” has become particularly charged and a contradictory site of investments as the polity integrates with the global economic order. In the process, “different agents have promoted either nationalism or neoliberalism [as best suited for mediating tradition and globalization], but they could never completely eclipse the other” (Bumochir 2020: 3). Unsurprisingly, then, contemporary discourses pose “sexuality” as an element of traditional society, though not fundamentally incompatible with queerness (Ganbaatar et al. 2022; Nyamdorj 2006; Terbish 2013). It is here in the center of change and transition, figured often as a contestation between “traditional” Mongolian society and the “modern” global movement for queer rights, that the Beyond the Blue Sky film festival finds its starting point. Ultimately, queerness as depicted by the festival and its films becomes just one of the many sources of contestation regarding the country's transformation, which allows it a unique entryway into the creation of Mongolia's national identity within a dynamic and fluid social order.At Beyond the Blue Sky, queerness is claimed and circulated by two distinct formations: the LGBT Centre, which curates and creates the festival, and the often amateur and young filmmakers who enter it. In their book Queer Cinema in the World, Karl Schoonover and Rosalind Galt (2016: 81) look at queer film festivals across the globe. According to the pair, “the queer film festival not only reflects the world but actively makes and remakes worlds . . . it responds to the institutions of world-building in which the festival's survival is implicated.” For them, worlding includes not just filmic content but “also the worlds imagined by the spaces and shapes of the event and the activities of its audiences. It . . . extends to paratexts such as promotion, sponsorship, and the structure of the program (including categorizations, sidebars, juxtapositions, and even omissions)” (86).In this sense the world created by Beyond the Blue Sky is nestled within the pride movement in Mongolia. That is, the film festival itself is one component of the country's pride festivities each year, themselves the result of both local politics and global discourses. For example, the LGBT Centre's Equality and Pride Days festival happens in late August every year instead of June when many Western countries hold their celebrations. This is because the summer is a time when many people leave the city for the countryside to enjoy the warmer weather, especially during Naadam, the country's national festival in July. August, on the other hand, was chosen as a time when people would be returning to school and work from vacation. However, the pressures of globalization are increasing. At the beginning of June, queer online space and social media in Mongolia are flooded with messages of “Happy Pride,” and the Centre is considering moving its pride celebrations to June in the coming years.Schoonover and Galt (2016) propose three main models for how global queer film festivals create worlds of their own. The MIX NYC model is one of exclusion through its experimental use of aesthetics, political messaging, and advertising targeting a wholly queer audience. Conversely, the KASHISH Film Festival in Mumbai is a mainstreaming experience, bringing together industry professionals and queer creators. Finally, the Batho Ba Lorato Festival in Gaborone, Botswana, doubles as an activist event, demanding respect for Botswana's queer community and even presenting legal challenges to advance queer rights. But what world is created in Ulaanbaatar by this festival?Given the festival's aim and the backdrop of homophobic media in Mongolia, the festival certainly has an activist component to it. In 2022 an interview with the winning film director and one of the judges was published on two of the biggest news websites in Mongolia. Unsurprisingly, the comments were mainly homophobic: “Please stop categorizing such absurd matters under the umbrella of ‘human rights.’. . . labeling what is clearly abnormal as normal is incorrect.” With such public pushback against the festival's mere existence, activism becomes a key part of it, along with other parts of the LGBT Centre's work.Likewise, staying with the festival typologies described above, Beyond the Blue Sky might have “exclusionary” impulses. In past years, the festival's prize money has attracted many straight cis filmmakers and even mainstream productions. Fearing that the festival might lose its core vision to empower queer artists and encourage them to create queer films, in 2022 the festival added a new rule stating that at least 30 percent of the film crew must identify as queer in some way. This was met with a harsh backlash from straight cis filmmakers who were angry and confused about the new rule, even calling it a form of discrimination. The festival, however, still targets a large general audience. Posters for it are put up at public bus stations, and the screenings in 2022 were held at Tengis Cinema, a popular theater in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city.While the festival has become more “exclusionary” in terms of what media it shows, its broader goal to increase visibility and empower local filmmakers remains. Likewise, to say that there is no queer visibility in existing Mongolian cinema would be inaccurate. In fact, homophobic stereotypes are particularly severe in comedy films and short skits, making queer people the target of ridicule. These forms of queer caricatures are on the rise because of social media, where queer people are mocked in entertainment feeds that target a straight audience. The pervasiveness of these queerphobic mediascapes within mainstream media makes Mongolia distinct from other East Asian media (Olonbayar 2021).One such example is the comedy skit “UK Visa’’ by the group Shine Uy, in which two straight Mongolian men pretend to be gay in order to get a UK visa. This skit exemplifies a harmful trope that has become widely accepted in Mongolian culture in the post-socialist era, that there are two types of gays: acquired (oldmol) and “congenital” or born (torolhiin). This concept of acquired homosexuality has become embedded in dominant mediascapes through these comedy skits and films and feeds homophobic arguments in Mongolian society (Olonbayar 2021). Not surprisingly, the concept of oldmol gei (acquired gayness) is prominent in homophobic discourse that positions queerness in Mongolia as a foreign import and not compatible with certain visions of national identity. Baasanjav Terbish (2013: 264) situates this phenomenon in the local context where “the topic of homosexuality, which has never been associated with ‘spiritual creativity’ or other positive values, is discussed more in the context of human rights and compassion by using clinical language.” Even the word for homosexual itself in Mongolian is foreign, borrowed from the Russian gomoseksual. The word is commonly shortened as gomo, often combined with oldmol, and is considered a derogatory term by some.While engaging these media feeds, it is important to note that the world of the festival extends beyond the spatial-temporal boundaries of screenings. The films are judged by a panel of judges, historically composed of the director of the LGBT Centre, a local film critic, and an international guest judge. In 2022 the guest judge was queer theorist and filmmaker Nguyen Tan Hoang (2014), who has written on queerness and film in Southeast Asia (LGBT Centre 2022b). While Southeast Asia is a defined geographic area, Mongolia does not really fit into any distinct world region. It is not one of the economically powerful “East Asian Tigers,” it is distinct in many ways from most Central Asian countries, and there is no real North Asia outside Russia. However, Nguyen's inclusion provides opportunities for pan-Asian solidarity and class solidarity between lower-middle-income Asian countries and their queer communities.Furthermore, the top three winners of the film festival are awarded sizable prize money, first place being 5,000,000 MNT, or roughly 1,500 USD. This money is awarded with the purpose of increasing the capacities of queer Mongolian filmmakers, which is also accomplished by trainings and equipment the Centre offers throughout the year for filmmaking by the public. The festival is not just an annual happening but also an ongoing project to empower the queer community.Since the films themselves come from the community, the lines between audience and actor become blurred. The festival is more than just entertainment; it's a rare time for the community to come together openly to watch themselves on the big screen and admire their hard work. Oftentimes the films can be replays of lived experiences or utopian projections of what life could be like, starring the people themselves who live through or strive for such lives. This is a good example of how “cinema as an institution and a medium appears to open the queer local to the world . . . the screen presents a world in which queers can live publicly which may be less possible to imagine beyond the theatre's walls” (Schoonover and Galt 2016: 81). In that way, an “Ulaanbaatar” model is unique and valuable to understand how festival space operates in context.Finally, we can also turn to Mongolian Pride's official 2022 video to see how and what worlds are created by the festival (LGBT Centre 2022a). The video is a series of vignettes of community members sharing what pride means to them and what makes them proud. Featured are Enkhjin, a trans youth activist; Alungoo, a bisexual mother; Lanamunkh, a trans model and artist; Bignuut, creative designer and small business owner; Dorjjantsan (Jack), an employee at the LGBT Center (and coauthor of this article); and Nyampurev, or Lady Vanity, a local drag performer. Several of the speakers make appeals to the audience encouraging them to join in on the feeling of pride. Lady Vanity shares that “everyone has something to be proud of,” and Lanamunkh says that “everyone, not just LGBT people, should be proud of the life they've lived and the challenges they overcome” (LGBT Centre 2022a). While these statements may come off as mainstreaming, another nuance is understanding the word for pride in Mongolian, bakharkhal. While the term gay pride goes without question in English, bakharkhal has a much more limited connotation and is best translated as pride in the sense of glory, the nation, or the military. It is often used to describe a soldier who went to war and protected the country, or an Olympian who made the country a winner. The idea of self-pride is a rather novel and poorly understood concept in Mongolian society. While the pride festival in Mongolia is officially known as Equality and Pride Days, Tegsh Erkh bakharkhliin odruud, the Centre will often just use Cyrillic characters to rewrite the English spelling of pride as прайд (praid) to connote the globalized meaning of the word when advertising or writing online. In this video, members of the community whom you might see out at the bar on the weekend, walking down the street, or at the LGBT Centre all push a new understanding of pride as self-love and acceptance, applicable to any member of society. These more mainstreaming statements, we argue, act in context as an invitation—an invitation of solidarity, intersectionality, and multidimensionality for all those who might not fit neatly into Mongolian society to see what alternatives might exist.Just a few minutes into the trailer for Mongolian Pride, Jack kisses his partner Erkhem in the main square of Ulaanbaatar (see fig. 1), Mongolia's capital and really only city (LGBT Centre 2022a). Physically, Jack is positioned between two statues of Mongolia's most infamous figures: Chinggis Khaan and Damdin Sukhbaatar, a former general who is credited with bringing communism to Mongolia in 1921 (whose legacy is complicated by the fact that he also restored Mongolian independence from Manchurian rule). Juxtaposed between these two figures, Jack and his partner interrupt and even unsettle historical views of sexuality in Mongolia. In this section, we will explore how socialism and post-socialism have been depicted at the festival through case studies of two key films. We will compare key pieces of post-socialist theory from queer and Mongolian authors to see how the films navigate, in the words of Schoonover and Galt (2016: 81), “a pressure to reconcile a globalizing mission with a local politics of being queer in the world.”Queer theorists have often taken issue with normative discourses that follow neoliberal transitions from socialism to democratic capitalism as necessary for development and queer rights. In her article “Mediating Syndromes of Postcommunism: Disability, Sex, Race, and Labor,” Czech gender, queer, and disability theorist Kateřina Kolářová (2019: 158) looks at how the work of filmmaker Wiktor Grodecki “destabilizes the dominant narratives of transition that picture Eastern Europe as (forever) overcoming the pathology of its socialist past.” Similarly, in his book Queer Marxism in Two Chinas, Petrus Liu (2015) argues against the incompatibility of Marxism and queerness as understood by the West.However, more often than not discussions of Mongolia are absent in post-socialist studies, despite the impact of socialism on Mongolia being arguably more dramatic than on many other countries. In recent years, Mongolian scholars have used postcolonial frameworks to understand the impact of socialism in Mongolia (Myadar 2020; Buyandelger 2008). Preceding the infusion of Marxist ideology, Mongolia “could not have been more antithetical to classical capitalist and industrial societies. Mongolia did not have a clear bourgeois class to be eliminated or a proletariat class who would be the vehicle of revolution and of building socialism” (Myadar 2017: 16). Indeed, the entire society had to be reworked to fit into the Soviet project. Buddhist institutions were completely destroyed, the alphabet was replaced, the countryside was divided into governable units and subunits, and nomadic pastoralism was reorganized into collectivities. While colonialism is often understood in part as the control of distant lands, Mongolia as a nomadic society was conceptually much more distant to its neighbor Russia than countries like the Czech Republic who shared similar agricultural and sedentary ways of being. Ultimately, “while symbolically sovereign, Mongolia lacked the power to take control over its own fate and became isolated under the new socialist regime as a geopolitically subservient subject of the Soviet Union” (9).Only one film from the festival available on the LGBT Centre's YouTube channel takes direct aim at the country's socialist past: Beyond the Blue Sky (Devaney and Miller 2010). The film follows two male lovers who live a significantly typical Mongolian life, in constant transit between the city and the countryside. Throughout the film, they make out, make love, ride horses, and herd livestock. The setting switches back and forth between an urbanized apartment and a ger, a traditional Mongolian yurt. Toward the end of the film, the couple are caught together in bed, and one of them is forcibly taken away by the intruder. While this is happening, stills of Zaisan Memorial in Ulaanbaatar, which commemorates the history of cooperation between Mongolia and the Soviet Union, are shown. The scene is evocative of the surveillance and judgment of homosexuality during the Soviet era and even today through lingering sentiments and loyalties. The scene is especially potent when considering that the Zaisan Memorial is situated on the top of a hill and is visible across almost all of Ulaanbaatar. It stands triumphantly over the city and marks the city's southern border against the steppe. In both physical and digital artifacts, the colonial shadow of socialism, as Orhon Myadar (2017) puts it, lives on for Mongolians.However, the film addresses socialism in a more nuanced way as well. The very last scene, after the loud sound of the morin khuur, a traditional Mongolian bow instrument, dies out, features one of the characters walking off into the distance. As figure 2 shows, the character is notably walking in a ger district, an area in the north of Ulaanbaatar that is composed of informal settlements of migrants from the countryside who come with their yurts in search of a better life. Ger districts known to be among the poorest areas in all of Mongolia. The area suffers from lack of infrastructure and transportation, deadly air pollution, soil contamination, and other social, economic, and environmental problems (Terbish, Lietaert, and Roets 2020). Ger districts are also a distinct post-socialist creation. Mongolia saw increased urbanization following the “shock therapy” of the 1990s, and the ger district provided an immediate refuge for those seeking to avoid extreme poverty (Byambadorj, Amati, and Ruming 2014). In the Mongolian case, shock therapy refers to the rapid switch from an economy reliant on the Soviet Council for Mutual Economic Assistance to a market economy. This transition was led not by Mongolian leaders but by international financial institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank. As a result, “Mongolia's social safety net began to crumble and commodity prices skyrocketed with the uncontrollable currency deflation. Unemployment soared, as did the overall poverty level and income gap, while a narrow segment of the population enriched itself by concentrating power over the few national industries” (Myadar and Rae 2014: 564).Another film that features distinctly post-socialist geography is Suis ton coeur (2021). The film follows the self-absorbed Soko and her best friend Oyu. While Oyu crushes on Soko, Soko has her sights on another man. One night in the rain, Oyu asks Soko if she wants to go to Mongolian Pride. Soko is disgusted by the prospect, saying, “It just seems so selfish and gross to me . . . their parents will be embarrassed” (Temuujin 2021). Later in the film, while heading to see her male lover, Soko comes to the realization that Oyu likes her as more than just a friend. She stops in her tracks for a dramatic panorama shot against the backdrop of the Zaisan neighborhood (see fig. 3). While also home to the Soviet monument of the same name, the Zaisan neighborhood is considered to be one of the richest parts of all Mongolia. It is home to luxury shops and homes and is located on the other side of the city from the ger district. Also a post-socialist creation, it has some of the newest developments in the city and exemplifies the inequality the country faces in the wake of neoliberalization.Soko runs back to find Oyu, and they face off across a street downtown. But it is too late, as Oyu has decided to permanently move to the countryside with her mother. Soko, who has come to represent consumerism, vanity, and homophobia, is strongly associated with the Zaisan neighborhood, a stark departure from the queer alignment with the ger district in Beyond the Blue Sky. The transition from socialism to democracy was also one that was controlled by outsiders, this time mainly the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and other neoliberal institutions (Myadar 2020). The argument can be made that if the socialist era were colonial, Mongolia continues to face outside controls and pressures to liberalize its new economy, resulting in the stark inequality shown in these films.Kolářová (2019: 161) notes that “Grodecki's films foster moral outrage at foreigners corrupting, using, and infecting Czech able-bodied men, which reflects a Czech self-understanding as always colonized. This outrage feeds existing moral panics over sexual, cultural, and religious difference.” As we have seen, the feeling of being constantly colonized can also be used to describe Mongolia. However, we would argue that in these queer films, this understanding does not lead to panic. Instead, these films use sexual difference to embrace the constant change often lamented in the case of Mongolia. They present complex interactions and disjunctions between sexual and economic difference, interactions that are “based on the exploration of the experiences of the peoples who accommodate, resist, interpret, and shape their lives in relation to, and despite, the failed transitions brought upon them” (Buyandelger 2008: 237). Queerness is on the move in these films, literally, as characters cross various boundaries, borders, and spaces. By locating these films in geographies that are symptoms of socialism, shock therapy, and neoliberalism, “the enduring nature of the experiences shows that there is no tangible line between the so-called transition and the so-called expected destination” (237). Instead, characters find themselves constantly under pressure. The films embrace the uncertainty, pain, and joy of such pressures and depict lives that are resilient in the face of them.As demonstrated throughout this essay, it is impossible to discuss any aspect of life in Mongolia without discussing the countryside, or khödöö broadly in Mongolian. Even the opening shot of the trailer for Mongolian Pride in 2022 features Lady Vanity dressed in drag as a traditional Mongolian woman on a hill surrounded by the steppe (LGBT Centre 2022a). Pictured in figure 4, rocky cliffs rise and fall behind her and give way to green pastureland. Rangeland makes up nearly the entire country outside Ulaanbaatar and is a defining characteristic of the country internationally. Yet the outside world often views the steppe in contradicting ways. Often it is seen as pure, pristine, and untouched by humans; other times, it is cold, barren, and an unforgiving wasteland. Despite widespread evidence of their existence, both visions of the steppe neglect the socio-ecological interactions and effectively posit the land as an empty place. Empty, on one hand, of human influence on the environment, and empty, on the other hand, of productive natural resources and biodiversity at large. Caroline Humphrey and David Sneath (1999: 1) suggest that these misguided visions of the countryside neglect the socio-ecological relationship central to Mongolian history: “Far from being a practice associated with the most backward herders, highly mobile livestock herding is often the basis for the most efficient, wide-ranging, well-coordinated, and specialized production.” Sneath writes extensively on the social institutions that historically governed Mongolian pastoralism and how today their role is in transition as formal socialist politics and market capitalism have dramatically altered the way people organize and govern the steppe. In this section, we will explore how queer Mongolian films recenter traditional Mongolian socio-ecological views of the countryside that respect diversity and equality in the natural world.The countryside and natural environment of Mongolia is nearly omnipresent, running in the background of many films shown at the festival. One such film is Inside World (2021). In Inside World, a trans figure sits in a field of grass and recites a creation story, as footage of another character dancing on the steppe is interplayed (see fig. 5). “There was a time when people lived on earth without any bodies. Only spirits,” the narrator begins, “the only thing that connected them was the feeling of love” (Batbold 2021). Eventually, love “was not enough for them,” so humans gained bodies, “but no one was the same” (Batbold 2021). The narrator then describes the birth of jealousy, hatred, ridicule, judgment, and other feelings that overtook love. While the narrator mentions the positives of physical connection, the creation of bodies made some “not feel human among others” (Batbold 2021). As the mood changes, the dancer stands triumphantly and surrealistically falls into the grassland. After describing how humans evolved to change themselves to please those different from themselves, the speaker changes to be male presenting, and a female voice is overlaid. The film ends with the speaker triumphantly declaring, “There are two people that exist inside of us. One of them always has to fit other people. Another wants to fit yourself. But I am the third, and I love it” (Batbold 2021), before walking off into the steppe and disappearing in the grass.While often viewed as an ancient practice holding out in a globalized world, the Mongolian pastoral system is also a site of change. The distinct steppe that has become synonymous with the country is being degraded at an alarming rate, owing to the rise in livestock populations following privatization and climate change (Sneath 2018). Furthermore, conservation in Mongolia has often relied on Western perspectives and priorities when it comes to natural resource management: “Environmentalist agendas reflect a familiar western interest in promoting western conservationist ideology. . . . Mongolian practices tend to be cast as traditions . . . rather than seen as part of wider social and political institutions of land use” (Sneath 2003: 441).Despite these external configurations, Inside World takes a noticeably Mongolian approach to environmental imaginations. The aesthetics and story at the center of the film deploy what Dulam Bumochir (2020: 124) coins the “Indigenous Environmental Cosmology” of the Mongolian malchin, or herder: “Traditional Mongolian cosmology and herding practice do not prioritize human rights and the individual's well-being, and do not pronounce human domination and triumphalism on earth . . . human beings must follow the law of nature, rather than ignore it.” The film mimics this idea of the Indigenous environmental cosmology by presenting the limits of humans as a sovereign entity outside the rest of nature. Humans lived in harmony when they were free spirits without a body, fully integrated with the natural nonhuman world, yet problems arise when humans become greedy for physical appearance in the film and, according to the Indigenous environmental cosmology, for money and control over the nonhuman environment. The queer view and critique of humanity in Inside World profoundly aligns with traditional Mongolian views of sustainability, which is especially potent when dealing with the almost-queered wasteland of the Mongolian steppe, whose socio-ecological complexity is often othered and misunderstood by outsiders. This traditional ideology serves as the main activist argument for the basic human rights of queer people in Mongolian society. It is a leveling force that respects the complexity of nature and culture in Mongolia, human and not, and even where they overlap.Bumochir's (2020) writing on the Indigenous environmental cosmology was mainly centered on Munkhbayar, an environmental activist in Mongolia who, despite gaining international attention for his work, maintained his identity as a malchin or herder. According to Munkhbayar, “Mongolians need to reclaim their ‘traditional’ cosmology of Mönkh Tenger. . . . Contrary to ‘Western’ opinion, the cosmology of the Mongols does not make human beings central, does not urge one to dominate and conquer earth, and does not consider the earth to be granted solely for the human being” (131). Mönkh Tenger, or the eternal sky, is an important concept in Mongolian society, encapsulating both literally and conceptually the malchin and the queer community. When it comes to the environment, queer depictions of liberation from physical boundaries and a desire to disintegrate back to some “original” state prove to be compatible with the original cosmology of Mönkh Tenger, pulling up a seat to the table for queerness in Mongolia's rich socio-ecological heritage.In the Mongolian language, Beyond the Blue Sky is known as Tsenkher Tengeriin Tsaana, with tenger deriving from the same cosmological concept of Mönkh Tenger mentioned above. However, this shamanistic tenger is not just an ancient custom but also a prominent idea in society that is even commonly referenced in modern pop songs (Uka 2013; Vandebo 2019). The name accurately exemplifies how the film festival and queer community as a whole in Mongolia leverage both globalizing and nationalizing ideologies to advocate for a place in their country's ever-changing national identity. Navigating the line between domestic and global, traditional and modern, queer Mongolians make use of their country's familiarity with change to enter the discourse at a time when national identity is being interrogated. Despite widespread misconceptions, the queer community in Mongolia rejects simplified understandings and visions of their situated and complex existence, corroborating Myadar's (2011: 356) view that “Mongolia may not be able, and indeed may not wish, to turn back the tide of globalization. . . . But it can seek to maintain a piece of itself by defining itself culturally in opposition to the global order, while at the same time being increasingly absorbed by it.”While the film festival envisions many worlds of its own, the reality of ongoing queerphobic social forces in Mongolian society is important in shaping nearly all of them. Even more than just one group in the myriad of actors in Mongolia itself, queerness itself might be viewed as one of the globalizing or indigenizing forces being employed by such actors, each with their own agenda in defining a changing nation. The Mongolian brand of queerness born out of the Beyond the Blue Sky festival is one that is global, demanding rights and respect not only within Mongolia but also on a global stage, and also extremely local, born out of a changing society still in the process of shaping its national identity. These multidimensional sources of both oppression and opportunity have allowed Mongolian queerness to be particularly resilient to issues facing Mongolians at large. The Mongolian mode of queerness emerges as one that is particularly adept at responding to threats from outside forces, whether it be homophobia, globalization, neoliberalization, nationalism, climate change, or other topics discussed in this review. It is this compatibility with change that links queerness to the complex and ever-shifting Mongolia as we know it.",2024-01-01,
A Wavelet Analysis of Bitcoin Price Volatility Dynamic,"The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant growth in international finance in recent years, attracting a large number of investors. This has led to a substantial increase in the overall trading volume[1], surpassing 1.2 trillion USD in July2023. Bitcoin in particular, has garnered significant interest from both advanced and emerging economies. Notably, Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador and the Central African Republic. The cryptocurrency market possesses distinct characteristics that set it apart from traditional markets such as exchanges, commodities, and equities. Its decentralization, facilitated by Blockchain technology, stands as a key differentiating factor. This technology enables anonymous trading of cryptocurrencies, with the identities of market participants, account holders, and electronic wallet managers remaining unknown. Consequently, there is an inherent ambiguity when it comes to characterizing the behavior of these investors or determining their preferred trading horizons. In this context, an important question arises: how do investors in the cryptocurrency market navigate price volatility? Furthermore, how do their trading strategies, which are inherently tied to their investment horizons, impact each other and consequently influence market prices? The heterogeneity hypothesis, which is a prevalent assumption in financial markets, is particularly relevant when exploring how investors in the cryptocurrency market navigate price volatility. The diverse trading strategies and approaches to handling price fluctuations among heterogeneous investors impact and influence the overall volatility and price dynamics of cryptocurrencies. The heterogeneity market hypothesis[2] refers to the existence of differences among investors or traders regarding their beliefs, information, risk preferences, investment strategies, and time horizons. In a heterogeneous market, investors, traders and financial institutions have varying views and expectations about the future performance of assets. These differences can manifest in various ways, such as market information access, market liquidity provision, trading strategies and market structure. While numerous empirical studies have explored the concept of market heterogeneity in relation to traditional assets such as those conducted by Müller et al. (1993;1997), Lux and Marchesi (2000), LeBaron (2000), Dacorogna et al. (2001) and Benhmad (2011), there is a paucity of research on this topic specifically focusing on cryptocurrencies. This paper aims to contribute to the existing literature that investigates the hypothesis of investor heterogeneity in traditional markets, including forex, stocks, and commodities. Specifically, we focus on the cryptocurrency market, which is predominantly dominated by Bitcoin. As of November 2021[3], Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the most actively traded cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization exceeding 1.2 trillion USD. Given its significance, Bitcoin garners substantial interest from investors across various categories. Therefore, this research seeks to uncover potential synergies among participants[4] in the cryptocurrency market and identify investor types and investment horizons prevalent in this market. By understanding these factors, we can gain insights into the dynamic volatility displayed by Bitcoin’s price. To tackle this issue, we investigate Bitcoin’s price volatility, analyzing causal relationships among short-term, medium and long-term traders by using wavelet transform to decompose volatility at different trading frequency scales[5] considered, then Granger causality test will be employed to determine if changes in one scale impact others. Furthermore, we extend this analysis by employing the nonlinear causality test proposed by Hmamouche. Y (2020). This nonlinear causality test goes beyond the limitations of the linear causality test and helps identifying potential nonlinear causal effects that may exist between the volatilities at different frequency scales, which could be overlooked by the linear causality test. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical framework relatively to the heterogeneity market hypothesis. Section 3 focuses on the empirical review. Section 4 and 5 turns to the data and methodology. Section 6 provides the empirical findings. Section 7 concludes.",2024-01-01,
Forecasting crude palm oil (CPO) prices with Arfima-Figarch method,"Palm oil plants process crude Palm Oil (CPO). CPO is an important commodity in Indonesia because Indonesia has the highest production rate in the world. The problem is that the price of CPO in Indonesia tends to fluctuate, leading to price instability. It is necessary to see the pattern of data from CPO prices with forecasting. In the analysis of time series data, there is a long memory phenomenon, so one of the methods used is the ARFIMA method. The ARFIMA method develops the ARIMA method with fractional value differencing. The ARFIMA method has residuals that meet white noise, normal distribution, and homogenity. However, some financial data have inhomogeneous residuals, so there is a need to test heteroskedasticity's effects. One of the proper methods of dealing with the effects of heteroskedasticity is the GARCH method. Another phenomenon that often occurs in the GARCH method is an asymmetric effect. FIGARCH is a development of the GARCH method for addressing data with asymmetric effects. The FIGARCH method is also very good in forecasting long memory effects. The aim of this research is to model and forecast the price of CPO using the ARFIMA-FIGARCH method in order to determine the future prices of CPO and facilitate decision-making for exporters and importers. The ARFIMA-FIGARCH method with the best model is ARFIMA(1, d, 3)-FIGARCH (1,d,1) with a differencing value (d) of 1.1355451 which is capable of forecasting with an AIC value of 16,290.",2024-01-01,
News Event-driven Forecasting of Commodity Prices,"Problem definition. Commodity prices have exhibited significant volatility in recent times, which poses an exogenous risk factor for commodity-processing and commodity-trading firms. Accurate commodity price forecasts can help firms leverage data-driven procurement policies that incorporate the underlying price volatility for financial and operational hedging decisions. However, historical prices alone are insufficient to obtain reasonable forecasts because of the extreme volatility.Methodology/results. Building on the hypothesis that commodity prices are driven by real-world events, we propose a method that automatically extracts events from news articles and combines them with price data using a neural network-based predictive model to forecast prices. In addition to achieving a high prediction accuracy that outperforms several benchmarks (by up to 13%), our proposed model is also interpretable, which allows us to identify meaningful events driving the price fluctuations. We found that the events frequently associated with major fluctuations in the price include ""natural"" (floods, cold waves, poor rainfall, etc.), hike (hikes in fuel prices, fares, highway tolls, etc.), policy (govt. actions curbing/promoting imports and/or exports, etc.), and elections, all of which are known drivers of price change.We used a corpus containing about 1.6 million news articles of a major Indian newspaper spanning 15 years and daily prices of four crops (onion, potato, rice and wheat) in India to perform this study. Our proposed approach is flexible and can be used to predict other time series data such as disease incidence levels or macroeconomic indicators that are also influenced by real-world events.Managerial implications. Firms can leverage price forecasts from our system to design inventory and procurement policies in the face of uncertain commodity prices. Commodity merchants can also use the forecasts to design optimal storage policies for physical trading of commodities when prices are volatile. Our findings can also significantly impact policymakers, who can leverage the information of impending price changes and associated events to mitigate the negative effects of price shocks.",2024-01-01,
A NodeMCU Based Low-Cost Portable Device for Change Indication in Multiple Financial Commodities of Various Market Paradigms,"Online trading has become an important component of the portfolio of investors as it provides an attractive and profitable investment option in spite of the risk involved. Many individuals embraced diversified financial portfolios and started investing in Stocks, Cryptocurrencies, Bonds, Metals and Commodities through online portals. It needs constant attention to the price of the financial commodities for obtaining profits. However, majority of the investors are landing in losses because of lack of such continual monitoring of the prices to ascertain the changes in the prices of financial commodities all the time. In this work, to assist user in order to avoid this tiresome task of continual monitoring, a prototype of a low cost portable device for change indication in price of multiple financial commodities of various trading paradigms based on NodeMCU is proposed. The device includes Data retrieval and processing (DRP) unit in the form of nodeMCU, control unit, and notification unit. The DRP unit initially obtains the list of the financial commodities and control parameters including sampling rate, threshold, and time delay from the Google firebase real time database which are collected from user through a mobile application. Further it fetches the real time price data of the financial commodities to compute the percentage change in the given time duration and obtain the prioritized list i.e., the list of financial commodities as per the descending order of absolute percentage change and instruct the notification unit to generate alarm through an audio buzzer incase at least if one of the financial commodity exhibits an absolute percentage change greater than a predefined threshold. The notification unit also contains Red and Green LED corresponding to each of the financial commodity to indicate negative and positive changes that are exceeding the threshold. Further, a LCD displays the details of the first financial quantity in the prioritized list. The control unit comprises of two designated switches to change the financial quantity whose details are to be displayed on LCD and a silent mode switch to disable the audio notifications for the sake of convenience of the user. A prototype of the proposed device is realized with 16 cryptocurrencies, a sampling rate of one sample per minute and a time delay of one hour for the purpose of the testing the device. A maximum of 0.20 % of mean error rate is observed in price of the Doge coin, and 0 % of mean error rate is observed in percentage change of price corresponding to all cryptocurrencies. Further the number of notifications using RED and GREEN LEDs are computed for all cryptocurrencies which are found to be exactly in match with the original data with various threshold values of 1%,2%,5%, and 10%. The total number of notifications including both Red and Green LEDs are found to be higher in HBAR. The proposed device assists investors to take timely decisions for profitable trading and provides valuable insights about the momentum of various markets to readjust the investments and balance the portfolios accordingly.",2024-01-01,
The Flipside of Financial Innovation: Why Contracts Fail,"We examine factors that predict the success and failure of financial innovations using a novel comprehensive database, which contains surviving and defunct commodity futures contracts traded on 28 exchanges between 1871 and 2022. New innovations are more likely to fail if they do not sufficiently compensate investors for risk, or if they experience extreme returns. Contracts are also less likely to succeed if they face significant competitive pressure from other products or exchanges. Sometimes, innovations fail because they experience systemic shocks such as wars, economic recessions and financial crises.",2024-01-01,
Sustainability Practices and Financial Performance of Coffee Producers in Nueva Vizcaya,"Coffee is one of the largest traded agricultural commodities in the world. Its production is an important component of the overall economy and is essential to the livelihoods of rural households in the developing countries. This study aimed to determine the extent of sustainability practices and financial performance of seven coffee producers from Nueva Vizcaya in different municipalities. The proponents used a structured questionnaire in gathering the data using descriptive correlational and financial performance analysis. The data was analyzed using the following statistical tools: Mean, Standard Deviation, Financial Profitability Ratio, Spearman Rho, and Thematic Analysis using IBM SPSS version 25. Findings reveal that, coffee producers are generally implementing sustainable practices in their operations, and they are achieving good financial performance, as evidenced by their average ROA, ROE, and ROS ratios. These shows a commendable balance between profitability and sustainability efforts. However, it is also revealed that there is no significant relationship between the variables, and a weak negative correlation between them is discovered. Moreover, most of the respondents are confident in their ability to ensure long-term sustainability as they continuously seek for growth and improvement in their efficiency and profitability. For further findings, the researchers recommend that coffee producers continue to implement sustainability practices, and for future researchers to include liquidity and solvency ratios to provide a more comprehensive assessment of financial health.",2024-01-01,
Finanzmärkte aktuell,"The prospect of higher growth rates in sales and profits in 2024 compared to the previous year is an important reason for the forecast of rising leading indices this year. The growth rates of the leading indices will be lower this year than in the previous year. The expected upward movement of the global stock market index is currently also being supported by the prospect of interest rate cuts by the Fed and the ECB this year. The US sectors with the highest expected total returns (including dividends) in the 1st half of 2024 are commodities, financials, industrials and technology. The quantitative earnings forecast for the energy sector index shows a decline.

The price of gold should also rise.",2024-01-01,
Beyond Volatility: Systemic Resilience and Risk Mitigation in Interconnected Commodity Markets,"In an era marked by escalating interdependence in commodity markets, understanding the system-wide volatility spillover dynamics is paramount. This research extends the seminal work of Diebold et al. (2017) to unravel the complexities within three crucial commodity segments—Agriculture, Energy, and Metal. Two novel system-wide indices, the resilience index and spillover index, are introduced, grounded in the delicate risk-resilience trade-off inherent in interconnected financial systems. The resilience and spillover indices become pivotal tools for gauging the system's ability to withstand shocks and generate spillovers. In the dynamic analysis, focusing on time-varying characteristics, the study uncovers systematic patterns in system resilience evolution. The sensitivity of resilience to spillover events is highlighted, particularly post the 2008 global financial crisis. Daily data analysis reveals critical periods of heightened spillover risks, facilitated by warning signals anchored in upper and lower bounds. Over a static analysis period spanning January 2000 to July 2023, the energy sector emerges as a notable shock generator, while the metal sector demonstrates exceptional shock absorption. Agricultural commodities exhibit varied resilience. The findings hold profound implications for energy policymakers, traders, and financial investors. Early identification of commodities susceptible to high-risk spillovers enables strategic risk management decisions. This research not only contributes to academic discourse but also provides actionable insights, emphasizing the utility of early warning indicators for fortifying financial resilience in an ever-evolving market landscape. The study stands as a testament to the power of insight and the foresight to navigate the intricate rhythms of global financial stability.",2024-01-01,
"The Influence of Peer Effects, Commodity Prices and its Hedging on Corporate Capital Structure: Evidence from the Oil and Gas Industry","This paper investigates the influence of peer financial choices on the capital structure decisions of European and North American listed companies in the oil and gas sector. It also examines how commodity prices, particularly oil and gas prices, and their corporate hedging affect capital structure policies. The findings underscore the existence of peer effects in the oil and gas industry, indicating that companies consider their peers' financial decisions when determining their capital structure. Further analysis reveals that oil and gas firms follow their peers' financial policies irrespective of the size of the capital markets. Additionally, the research highlights that oil and gas prices, along with the hedging against these prices exposure, impact the capital structure of oil and gas companies, providing invaluable insights for industry practitioners and policymakers.",2024-01-01,
Cross-Border Banking and the Transmission of Global Shocks to Credit Cycles in Developing Economies: A Commodity Price Cycles Channel,"The literature on the transmission of global credit market shocks to credit cycles in developing countries emphasizes the role of cross-border banking, but seems to side-step the important role of commodity trade. To address the gap, we hypothesize that global credit market shocks are transmitted to credit market cycles in developing economies directly through cross-border banking capital flows and indirectly through the interaction between bank capital flows and commodity price cycles. We specify plausible econometric models to represent the hypotheses and we estimate the models using a panel sample of 74 developing countries. We uncover new robust evidence that cross-border banking capital flows directly accentuate credit cycles in developing countries. The evidence also identifies commodity price cycles as an important indirect transmission channel. These findings prompt policy makers in developing countries to pay attention to the commodity price cycles channel in designing policies to minimize vulnerability to global financial shocks.",2024-01-01,
The Determinants of the Time-Varying Equity Premium,"The ex-ante excess return required by investors for taking positions in the stock market is found to be negatively related to changes in real personal consumption expenditures, commodity price inflation, short-term interest rates, and the term spread. However, the ex-ante Sharpe ratio is discovered to have a significantly negative association with only the latter two variables. The overall findings supply evidence of a market risk premium that is economically countercyclical due primarily to procyclical investor risk tolerance. Measures of financial market volatility and sentiment are found to have no separate impact on the equity premium.",2024-01-01,
Financial Market Risk Spillover after Covid-19: A Multidimensional Higher-Order Moment Analysis Based on Garchsk-Vine Copula-Covar Model,"The transmission of significant information through commodity futures, stock and ESG bond markets in terms of returns and actual volatility is critical for investors to reduce portfolio risk by understanding the dependencies and risk spillovers among them. We employ the GARCHSK-Vine Copula-CoVaR methodology to explore the dependencies and risk spillovers between markets from the perspective of multidimensional higher moments. Compared with other models, we describe the higher moment characteristics of data and extend CoVaR from bivariate to a multivariate framework, thus mitigating the underestimation of risk spillover effects that may occur due to the overlooked indirect impacts on financial assets.",2024-01-01,

Energy Markets,"The energy landscape is ever-evolving, with electricity emerging as a special commodity that drives economies and sustains modern life. This chapter delves into the complex realm of energy markets, with a particular focus on the electricity sector. We explore how electricity has transformed from a simple utility to a multifaceted and indispensable resource. The evolution of the electricity sector is a central theme, tracing its roots from centralised generation and distribution to the diversification of energy sources, the rise of renewable, and the integration of smart grids. This historical context sets the stage for understanding the intricate dynamics of today's energy markets. The chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the general structure of wholesale electricity markets, dissecting the key components that govern its functioning. This includes forward markets, where long-term contracts are traded to ensure future supply and demand; day-ahead markets, which facilitate the scheduling of electricity for the next day; intraday markets, allowing for real-time adjustments; balancing markets, which maintain system stability; imbalance settlement, which reconciles deviations from scheduled energy; and ancillary services, critical for grid reliability. Moreover, financial markets play a pivotal role, allowing participants to hedge against price fluctuations and manage risk. By examining these facets of energy markets, readers will gain a profound understanding of the complex interplay between supply and demand, pricing mechanisms, and the critical role of electricity in our modern world. This chapter serves as a valuable resource for anyone seeking insights into the intricate web of energy markets and the vital role of electricity within them.",2024-01-01,
Do Crude Oil Price Fluctuations Affect the Sectoral Stock Returns: Evidence from India,"Crude oil is a vital energy source for industrialised and developing countries. Both investors who trade crude oil derivatives and firms that use oil as raw material for production monitor oil supply and demand. Disruption in the flow of oil in the commodity markets, therefore, leads to oil price volatility that affects major economies worldwide. Often, geopolitical and natural conditions could adversely impact the oil price and the financial markets react to such fluctuations in oil prices. This paper analyses the effects of oil price changes on sectorial stock returns in India. Using daily returns of S&amp;P BSE Sensex, S&amp;P BSE Oil &amp; Gas and S&amp;P BSE-Auto sectoral indices from January 2000 to March 2020, we examined the impact of Brent crude oil price fluctuations on the two major sectorial stock indices and overall market index. The results of the Granger causality test show significant results on S&amp;P BSE-Sensex and S&amp;P BSE-Oil and Gas Index Returns except S&amp;P BSE-Auto Index Returns.

ORGANIZED COMMODITY MARKETS IN THE SYSTEM OF MARKET RELATIONS,"The article highlights the concept of an organized form of trade. The economic essence of organized commodity markets is expressed through the prism of the market relations formation. It is noted that organized commodity markets occupy a prominent place in the market economy system due to their functions and economic purpose. The classification of organized commodity markets depending on the types of commodity assets is given, including agricultural markets, markets of metals, energy resources, timber and other assets. It was noted that organized commodity markets evolved over many centuries, therefore they adapted in their development certain joint achievements, as well as individual characteristics that arose on the basis of historically formed traditions, social and legislative norms, the formation of economic relations. The economic essence of organized commodity markets in the modern system of the market economy, which provides for the provision of an organized form of trade in commodity and financial markets, is defined. It is noted that the concept of ""organized trade"" can be replaced by the concept of ""exchange trading"", and ""organized market"" by the concept of ""exchange market"". It was determined that the characteristic features of an organized form of trade are the presence of an exchange infrastructure, specific rules of exchange trading. as well as the possibility of standardizing the parameters of exchange assets. An important place in the organized commodity market is given to organized platforms or commodity exchanges. The commodity exchange is a market institution that provides an efficient market environment for transparent pricing and forecasting of price risks. It was established that the importance of organized trade in commodity assets stems from the functional purpose of the organized commodity market due to the provision of: formation of a competitive environment in the market of real assets; transparent pricing of raw materials; price risk management mechanism; effective redistribution of financial resources; access to an open information environment. It has been established that the characteristic features of modern organized commodity markets are: electronicization; globalization; financialization; universalization.",2024-01-01,

Regulating and Directing the Healthy Development of Various Types of Capital in China under the Guidance of the Capital View of Historical Materialism,"Only by adhering to the scientific concept of capital as explained by Marx in Capital , and by drawing a clear line between the two different views of capital based on materialist and idealist conceptions of history, can we understand the phenomenon of capital in the real economy of contemporary China. In the real economy of developing commodity production, public and private capital share some common features, but there are differences in their nature. The misunderstanding, created by Western bourgeois economics, of the relationship between public and private capital harms efforts to achieve a scientific regulation of the healthy development of various types of capital, and needs to be clarified. Where the practical work of regulating and guiding the healthy development of capital is concerned, great importance should be attached to restoring and guaranteeing the dominant position of public capital within social capital as a whole; to ensuring that state-owned capital effectively fulfills the dominant role; to strictly governing the otherwise disorderly development of private capital; to strengthening control over the quantity and quality of foreign capital introduced to the economy; and to keeping state-owned capital firmly in control of the national financial system.",2024-01-01,

China’s Economic Strategy in Latin American and Caribbean Countries,"The article analyzes the patterns of formation and development of China’s economic strategy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) from 2008 to 2023. The object of study is the economic strategy of the PRC, and the subject is the Latin American direction of the strategy. The hypothesis is that China’s economic ties with countries are a specific variation of “center-periphery” relations. These ties arose as a result of the development of a new economic model of China from the late 1990s to the mid&amp;#8209;2000s. This model is characterized by a focus on domestic demand and capital export while maintaining a high level of state participation. The global financial and economic crisis of 2008 created more favorable conditions for the penetration of Chinese companies into Latin America. LAC countries had to compensate for losses from the decline in demand from traditional partners. China, in turn, needed labor and resource sources. These relationships intensified after a sharp drop in commodity prices in 2014. Moreover, in this case, the advantages of the Chinese economic model over the traditional partners of the region allowed to strengthen the presence even more, offering better conditions in the field of trade, investment, and finance. The analysis of trade, investment, infrastructure projects, and finance showed that China is forming its version of “center-periphery” relations with LAC countries based on the dominance of state-owned companies. Unlike the traditional model, which is based on the need for investment return and a high level of profitability, China is building its production infrastructure, increasing the level of economic development of LAC countries. At the same time, in recent years, negative trends can be traced in a number of directions of China’s foreign economic activity in the region, which can become a challenge for the set goal – to achieve the status of one of the leaders.",2024-01-01,
Actors’ Perceptions of Profitability Along a Bushmeat Commodity Chain in West Africa (Southern Benin),"Background and Research Aims: The bushmeat trade is one of the main drivers of faunal extinction in tropical Africa. We assess the profitability of the bushmeat trade along the commodity chain in southern Benin and study the perceptions of the actors on the profitability of the trade. Methods: Data were collected through direct interviews. A total of 120 bushmeat trade actors were interviewed in southern Benin. Economic and financial indicators were estimated and compared using descriptive statistics. Factors affecting the actors’ perception of wild animal hunting, trading or supply sustainability were assessed using binary logit. Results and discussion: A total of 15 species were traded along the bushmeat commodity chain in southern Benin. During the dry season, hunters’ gross product is higher because of greater hunting effort, and traders earn more commercial margin. Throughout the chain of actors, bushmeat trade profitability is seen as positively affected by the number of hunters per household and the availability of large preys (hunters), household size (sellers) and monthly income (consumers); whereas negative factors affecting profitability are distance from hunting sites (hunters), supply issues (sellers) and the cost of the meat (consumers). Both hunters and consumers see hunting and trade regulation measures as negatively impacting bushmeat profitability. Conclusion and implications for conservation: The perception of profitability by bushmeat commodity chain actors in southern Benin is conditioned by a set of socio-economic factors that should be considered in national conservation policies and development programs to keep bushmeat hunting profitable and sustainable.",2024-01-01,

Approaches to improving the efficiency of horticultural enterprises in the Republic of Dagestan,"The article is devoted to the urgent regional problem of improving the efficiency of horticultural enterprises in the Republic of Dagestan. It is noted that the significant decrease in the contribution of this category of commodity producers to the production of fruit products, the lack of innovation and investment activity limit the development not only of the horticultural sub-branch, but also of the entire agro-food sector of the Republic. The aim of the research is to develop proposals to strengthen the position of horticultural enterprises in the national production of fruit products and to improve the efficiency of their activities. The methodology of the work is based on the use of regional statistical information, as well as on studies of domestic scientists and economists in the field of horticultural enterprises and development of various forms of management. Production and economic activity of horticultural enterprises located in three natural-climatic zones of the Republic is analyzed. The analysis period is 2017–2022. Conclusions are drawn on the necessity of differentiated placement of perennial orchard plantings on the territory of the Republic, deepening of specialization of each natural-climatic zone, application of increasing coefficients of state support, provided that perennial orchard plantings are planted at an altitude higher than 500 m above sea level. It has been shown that the small size of perennial plantings does not allow horticultural enterprises to achieve high production volumes, even if intensive cultivation techniques are used. It is recommended to the regional authorities to implement legal and organizational measures for the expansion of areas through cooperation between horticultural enterprises and small private subsidiary farms of the population. It is proposed to create a passport and an electronic database of horticultural land in the Republic. An investment plan for the development of horticulture in the Republic until 2035 has been developed. The projected increase in the volume of fruit production will contribute to the increase in the financial indicators from the sale of products, increase in the economic efficiency of horticultural enterprises. The forecast calculation of the required volume of financial investments for capital and current expenditures in case of increasing the area of perennial plantings is presented. The main source of financing is the regional budget. Calculations have shown that the payback period of the project will be eight years with a rate of return of 30%. The materials obtained in the process of this study will allow to make certain adjustments in the prospects of industrial location, to become the basis for the development of strategy and comprehensive programs of regional development of horticulture and rural areas.",2024-01-01,
Impact And Acceptability of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) And Pharmacovigilance Campaign Among Under-Five Children In Nigeria: An Explanatory Study,"Globally, an estimated 249 million malaria cases occurred in 2022, leading to 608,000 malaria deaths in a single year. Malaria is one of the most severe public health problems, with nearly half of the world’s population at risk for infection [1]. Infants and young children continue to suffer the greatest mortality; in 2022, an estimated 4 out of 5 malaria-related deaths in the African Region were from children under 5 years of age. Inequities in access to education and financial resources further exacerbates risk: children under 5 years of age from the poorest households in sub-Saharan Africa are 5 times more likely to be infected with malaria than those from the wealthiest house holds [2]. Malaria is transmitted throughout Nigeria, with 97% of the population at risk of malaria. The duration of the transmission season ranges from year-round transmission in the south to three months or less in the north. Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant malaria species. According to the 2021 World Malaria Report, Nigeria had the highest number of global malaria cases (26.6% of global malaria cases) and the highest number of deaths (31% of global malaria deaths) in 2021. The country accounted for an estimated 54% of malaria cases in West Africa in 2021 [3]. The under- five malaria in Nigeria is a leading cause of global child mortality, accounting for 95,000 annual child deaths [4]. Malaria is one of the leading causes of death in Nigeria. According to the 2020 World Malaria Report, Nigeria accounts for 27 percent of malaria cases globally and 23 percent of deaths from the disease, 30 percent of admissions to Nigeria’s hospitals are as a result of malaria. In rural populations, prevalence is 2.4 times that in urban populations (31% vs. 13%). Compared to the highest socioeconomic group, prevalence among children in the lowest socioeconomic group is seven times higher (38% vs. 6%). In Nigeria, there is still insufficient data around health more widely, which impacts the amount of evidence available for decision-making. In response to the malaria situation and to guide implementation, the National Malaria Elimination Program (NMEP) initiated the High Burden High Impact (HBHI) approach with technical support from the WHO and technical partners to address the malaria situation in Nigeria [5]. In Nigeria, malaria is a major public health concern especially among under-five of age. SMC was adopted in Nigeria in 2014 and by 2021 was being implemented in 18 states, over four months between June and October by 143,000 community drugs distributors (CDD) to target population of 23 million children [6]. In 2012, the NMEP changed the first-line treatment for severe malaria from quinine to injectable artesunate, consistent with WHO treatment guideline. The recommended pre-referral intervention for severe malaria is intramuscular or rectal artesunate, intravenous quinine, or intravenous artemether. Microscopy data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) show that the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia in children under five years of age is 2% (a decrease from 2% in 2015 and 42% in 2010), although there are significant regional, rural-urban, and socioeconomic differences: prevalence ranges from 16% in the South and South East Zones to 34% in the North West Zone. The current 2021–2025 National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP) is based on the vision of achieving a malaria-free Nigeria with a goal of reducing malaria morbidity to less than 10 percent parasite prevalence and mortality attributable to malaria to less than 50 deaths per 1,000 by 2025 [5]. Malaria Consortium supported the National Malaria Elimination Programme to build capacity within the health system more broadly and support in the delivery of interventions in the country. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is the administration of a full course of antimalarial treatment combination during the malaria season to prevent illness and death from the disease. It is an important public health intervention that is being used to reduce the burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in at risk populations such as children under 5 years of age. SMC campaign is a widely accepted intervention to reduce the burden of malaria in this population [2, 7, 8]. SMC involves the administration of a full course of antimalarial drugs, typically at monthly intervals, during the malaria transmission season. [9] This intervention has effectively reduced the burden of malaria in children under 5 years of age in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa and has malaria been recommended by the WHO as a strategy for malaria prevention in this age group. [10] The drugs used for SMC include Sulfadoxine, Pyrimethamine (SP) and Amodiaquine (AQ). The combination of these is called SPAQ. These drugs are administered in combination as a single dose, which is repeated monthly for 3–4 months during the high transmission season. SMC is recommended for children aged 3–59 months, and it has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of malaria in areas with seasonal transmission. SPAQ 1 and SPAQ 2 refer to the different regimens of SP and AQ used in SMC in Nigeria. SPAQ 1 is a single dose of SP and AQ given together, which is administered monthly for 4 to 5 months during the high transmission season. The dose of SP is 25 mg/kg, while the dose of AQ is 10 mg/kg given once daily for 3 consecutive days. This regimen is used for children weighing between 5 and 14 kg. SPAQ 2, on the other hand, is a similar regimen of SP and AQ given together, but it is used for children weighing more than 14 kg. The dose of SP is 1.25 g, while the dose of AQ is 50 mg/kg given once daily for 3 consecutive days. The difference between SPAQ 1 and SPAQ 2 is primarily in the dosages of SP and AQ used and the weight of the children for whom they are recommended. SPAQ 1 is for children weighing between 5 and 14 kg, while SPAQ 2 is used in children weighing more than 14 kg. It is important to note that only qualified health care professionals should administer these drugs as part of the SMC program [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Case numbers decreased 2% between 2020 and 2021, from 312.7 to 306 per 1000 of the population at risk. Deaths decreased 3.5%, from 0.94 to 0.91 per 1000 of the population at risk during that same period [7]. SMC is an important public health intervention that can reduce the malaria burden in at risk populations, such as children under 5 years of age. [6, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] SMC campaign utilizes door to door channels, with the health facilities serving as a hub unit of operation and quality assurance points for health product management, training, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation. The distribution strategy for these commodities was designed to fit into the National Malaria Commodity Logistics Management System. According to SMC Alliance annual meeting report, it was announced that 53 million children were covered by SMC in 2023. The largest number of children were reached in Nigeria, with about 28.7 million children treated per cycle of SMC. Cumulatively 1,078 million treatments delivered since 2012 [25].",2024-01-01,
INSIDER INFORMATION AND ITS ROLE IN ENSURING THE EFFICIENT FUNCTIONING OF THE INVESTMENT FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKET,"The evolution of the main regulatory acts of the EU, which regulate insider transactions and countering market abuse, is considered in the article. The reasons for the modernization of normative acts and their main features are highlighted. Based on the analysis of current regulations (MAR Regulation, MAD II Directive), the essence of insider information and its features are revealed. Such features are accuracy, non-publicity, relationships with issuers or financial instruments, the likelihood of a significant impact on prices after publication. The priority of economic goals over legal ones in the process of legislative regulation of combating abuse of insider information is substantiated. The economic goals of regulating abuses in the investment financial services market include creating equal conditions for all market participants, protecting investors, and ensuring effective pricing. The need to ensure equal access to information, eliminate information asymmetry between market participants, as conditions for reducing the riskiness of investors' investments and countering abuses in the market of investment financial services was emphasized. The importance of legislative protection against the abuse of insider information, which consists in establishing administrative and criminal liability, is substantiated. Significant differences in administrative and criminal liability for insider abuse in the legislation of Ukraine and the EU were revealed. The current and prospective legislative regulation of the disclosure of insider information and countering abuse in the market of investment financial services in Ukraine is considered. The limitations of the law ""On Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets"" in force since July 1, 2021 were revealed, in which Chapter XII ""Combating Abuses in Capital Markets and Organized Commodity Markets"" regarding the content and prohibition of the use of insider information takes into account the requirements of the MAD Directive of 2003, and not MAR Regulation. The need for a different approach to the norms and criteria for the qualification of abuses during the implementation of the MAR Regulation and the MAD II Directive into Ukrainian legislation is substantiated.",2024-01-01,
MANAGEMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM OF STOCK TRADING AS A MODEL OF THE ORGANIZED MARKET OF GOODS,"It has been outlined that stock exchanges are the main organizers of securities trade in Ukraine, which provide a platform for buying and selling various financial instruments. The categorical set of the conceptual apparatus of diffusion of knowledge on the management of the development of derivative contracts in the institutional mechanism of exchange trading is defined. It has been proposed to define the characteristics of the institutional mechanism of exchange trading as a model of an organized market of goods in which the processes of managing the development of derivative contracts take place. It is highlighted that some securities have limited circulation, which means that they can be sold only to certain persons or organizations that issued them, and after that such securities are considered non-negotiable, since their sale is limited to a set period and conditions. It is noted that the model of the organized market of goods is mainly formed under the influence of productive leading sectors of the economy, regulation and supervision, infrastructure and market participants, financial instruments and the trade process. The rating of securities traders-members of JSC “PFTS Stock Exchange” for the period January-February 2023 and January 2024 is given. The system of concepts of the essence of the relevant category apparatus has been updated, which includes: management, development, trade, derivative, contract, financial instrument, institutional mechanism, exchange trade, exchange commodity, organized market, which are used to form knowledge about the content of the raised question. It has been proven that the organized market of goods is an orderly system that facilitates the efficient exchange of goods between sellers and buyers, and to create such a model, it is necessary to take into account the generalized key aspects. It has been justified that the effective conduct of economic activity is ensured by active stock exchange trading of goods, which allows setting parity prices for products and the material and technical resources necessary for their production.",2024-01-01,
Methodological Principles of Simulating Asymmetrical Volatility of Corporate Credit Market Dynamics,"Forecasting and modelling of price dynamics of financial instruments and their volatility is an essential element of technical analysis of financial markets. The real sector is also interested in changes in volatility as it seeks to maintain stability in financial and commodity markets. The article aims to develop methodological approaches to modelling the dynamics and volatility of the Ukrainian corporate credit market using asymmetric GARCH approaches. It has been established that the risky nature of financial markets is a prerequisite for analyzing and modeling the volatility of their dynamics in order to correctly respond to possible spikes in volatility, as well as to predict their duration. The analysis was based on daily data on interest rates on the corporate credit market. A graph of the initial time series, autocorrelation functions was plotted, the series was checked for stationarity by the Dickey–Fuller test, which led to its differentiation and subsequent formation of the optimal ARIMA specification. When checking the residuals for autocorrelation and the ARCH effect, positive results were obtained, which led to the use of the GARCH model. Going through various GARCH specifications made it possible to choose GJR-GARCH for modeling, which takes into account the asymmetry of the impact of information shocks on the profitability management of active bank operations. The resulting model was tested by the Leung–Box test, the ARCH LM test, and the Pearson test for the optimality of the specification. The model was compared with actual time series data. All the results confirmed the correctness of the built models, which allows them to be used for analysis and forecasting for further periods.",2024-01-01,
AGRO-FOOD EXPORT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION: IDENTIFICATION OF DEVELOPMENT TRENDS AND REALIZATION OF POTENTIAL,"Agriculture is one of the priority areas for the development of the Russian economy, which accounts for about 4% of Russian GDP.

ENSURING NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY IN THE CONDITIONS OF GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES,"The article examines the concept of food security as a key component of national stability in the context of globalization processes. The role of the agricultural sector and state regulation in ensuring food self-sufficiency is highlighted, indicators of self-sufficiency, availability and consumption of food in Ukraine are analyzed. Along with this, the global food security index (GFSI) of Ukraine and the value of its components in 2021-2022 were studied. An analysis of the dynamics of the value of the food basket in Ukraine for the years 2019-2024 was carried out and the processes affecting the formation of this value were identified. Ukraine, with its favorable climate and abundant natural resources, is a significant player in global agriculture. It produces enough food not only for its domestic market but also for export, particularly in staple commodities like wheat, corn, and sunflower oil. These agricultural products support both self-sufficiency and Ukraine's role as an important exporter. The positive and negative aspects of globalization, its impact on the structure of exports and imports are analyzed in detail, and the key threats to the country's food security, particularly in war conditions, are identified. The state initiatives and legal acts introduced to improve Ukraine's food safety are examined in detail. The article also suggests directions for increasing the stability of the food system in Ukraine. In conclusion, while Ukraine's agricultural potential is significant, addressing global and domestic challenges is critical for securing long-term food security. By supporting domestic production, diversifying trade, and improving food quality control, Ukraine can not only maintain its food independence but also strengthen its global position. In particular, this can be achieved by providing financial and technological support to farmers, encouraging sustainable farming practices, and investing in agricultural innovation. A focus on innovation, infrastructure development, and sustainability will allow the country to better navigate the complexities of the modern food market and safeguard its food systems for future generations.",2024-01-01,
Stimulation of High-Tech Exports as the Basis of the Strategy of Post-War Recovery of the Ukrainian Economy,"The aim of the article is to assess the export activity of Ukraine and determine its role in the conditions of the ongoing war and post-war recovery of the national economy. Economic growth rates are higher in countries that are deeply integrated into global value chains, have a more diversified export structure, and focus on the quality of their own exports. In the pre-war period, Ukrainian exporters had a number of internal (difficulties in accessing financing for the production and sale of export products, low level of production technologies, non-compliance of national products with the technical requirements and standards of the world market, burdensome border crossing procedures, corruption, etc.) and external problems (unstable conditions in foreign markets of raw materials), which negatively affected the results of export activity. A sharp decline in Ukrainian exports during the wartime is caused by restrictions on production, financial, technological, and human resources resulting from the physical destruction of enterprises and logistics infrastructure, the loss of part of the workforce due to an increase in mortality and its outflow abroad, a decrease in income due to an unprecedented decline in business activity and production efficiency, the inability to insure war risks, etc. According to the experience of South Asian countries, which are now leaders in terms of high-tech exports (Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea), changes in the commodity structure of exports by reducing the volume of raw materials and increasing the share of high-tech goods, as well as IT services, can become the basis for preserving the Ukrainian economy during the war and the post-war recovery, which requires stimulating scientific and technical research and development by increasing investment in innovation areas, the State support for exporters of high value-added products.",2024-01-01,
Can the major cryptocurrencies be used as a portfolio diversifier?,"Purpose : It can be stated that in today’s competitive conditions, where portfolio management is very important, it has become necessary to examine the relationship between global financial assets and major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This paper aims to investigate the cointegration and causalityrelationships between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and global financial assets such as gold, oil, the S&amp;amp;P Global 100, the Dow Jones Commodity, and the US Dollar Indices, and to determine the diversification role of Bitcoin and Ethereum comparatively for the period between April 2016 and January 2024. Methodology: The ADF Unit Root, Johansen Cointegration, Granger Causality, Rolling Window Causality tests, and Variance Decomposition Analysis methods were used in the analysis process. Results: Based on the findings obtained from the paper, it was determined that Bitcoin and Ethereum have no cointegration with selected financial asset classes. Granger causality analysis results indicated that there were unidirectional causalities from Bitcoin and Ethereum prices to Dow Jones Commodity Index prices. In addition to the results of the Rolling Window causality tests, it was also determined that there are some causalities between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other variables, especially after the 2021-2022 period. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Bitcoin and Ethereum are effective portfolio diversifiers throughout the entire period; however, the diversification effects of Bitcoin and Ethereum weakened towards the end of the review period. Therefore, it can be said that Bitcoin and Ethereum act similarly in the global investment portfolio.",2024-01-01,
"COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MARKET INDICATORS OF INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS (based on the materials of NESTLE GROUP, HERSHEY CO, KRAFT HEINZ CO)","Abstract. The article presents a comparative analysis of indicators reflecting the market positions of three international corporations: NESTLE GROUP, HERSHEY CO, KRAFT HEINZ CO. Object of study: internal corporate factors that affect the market value of shares of international corporations. The objectives of the article were to study the internal corporate factors that affect the market valuation of shares and to identify current trends in the formation of the competitive policy of international food corporations. Research methods: monographic, analytical, coefficient, statistical, graphical. It is found that the market valuation of shares is influenced by the operating, investment and financial policies of the corporation. Thus, operating activities generate revenues and profits, which are the source of dividends. Through investment activities, the corporation focuses its financial resources on the production of certain products, provides access to cheaper raw material markets or expands its sales markets. Financial activities involve providing the corporation with the necessary long-term resources. The ability of the corporation to service the attracted capital indicates its financial strength and implementation of development plans. Based on a generalisation of the main actions of the researched international corporations aimed at increasing the market attractiveness of shares, it has been found that they resorted to the following actions: 1) sale of businesses that do not provide corporations with sufficient efficiency; 2) active implementation of the world's best operating practices in their own corporations; 3) active entry into commodity markets, which allows reducing their own costs and obtaining higher profits. At the same time, there is experience of unfair treatment of investors through attempts to artificially reduce costs and ‘embellish’ earnings per share. Such actions have had a negative impact on the market valuation of shares, despite the corporation's stable financial performance.

"Organic Agriculture in Uttarakhand: Progress, Potential, and Policy Perspectives","Organic agriculture has emerged as a solution to global concerns over food security, environmental degradation, and climate change, with Uttarakhand playing a key role in India’s organic farming landscape. The state currently boasts 2.26 lakh hectares of certified organic land, comprising 40% of its total agricultural area, and engages 4.80 lakh farmers in organic practices. Various government initiatives, including Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), and the Namami Gange Project, have significantly boosted organic farming. Training programs and support from the Uttarakhand Organic Commodity Board and the Department of Agriculture further promote the sector. In a pioneering move, the government enacted the Uttarakhand Organic Agriculture Act 2019, making it the first Indian state to introduce such legislation. Currently, 10 development blocks are fully organic, with plans to expand statewide. However, achieving this ambitious goal requires enhanced financial support, better marketing, and more robust research efforts.",2024-01-01,
MICROBUSINESS AND MICROCOMPETENCES,"According to the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, by the end of 2023, the number of people employed in small and medium-sized businesses in Russia amounted to about 27 million people. Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the most important factor in the socio-economic development of any state. The unemployment rate and improvement of the quality of life of citizens depend on the development of SMEs. SMEs create prerequisites for the development of competition and contribute to reducing dependence on commodity exports. There is a lot of talk about the importance of SMEs in Russia. In recent years, the control and administrative burden on business has been reduced, tax regimes have been optimized, access of SMEs to financial resources has been simplified, and the image of entrepreneurial activity has been improved. In our opinion, another vector of ensuring the qualitative development of SMEs in Russia is training. Namely, the acquisition of professional competencies by both business owners and their subordinates. The article is devoted to the study of microbusiness and the microcompetencies necessary for it.",2024-01-01,
Risk Management and Hedging Techniques in Islamic Finance: Addressing Market Volatility without Conventional Derivatives,"Risk management is a critical component of financial stability, yet Islamic finance faces unique challenges in this area due to its strict adherence to Sharia principles, which prohibit the use of conventional derivatives such as futures, options, and swaps. These instruments are often deemed speculative and involve gharar (excessive uncertainty), which conflicts with Islamic ethical guidelines. As a result, Islamic financial institutions must develop alternative, Sharia-compliant techniques to hedge against market volatility and manage risks effectively. This review explores innovative approaches to risk management in Islamic finance, emphasizing strategies that align with its foundational principles of risk-sharing, ethical investment, and asset-backed transactions. Key techniques include the use of Wa’ad (unilateral promises) to create risk mitigation structures, Tawarruq (commodity Murabaha) for managing liquidity, and Ijarah-based contracts as alternatives to conventional interest rate swaps. Additionally, leveraging fintech innovations such as blockchain and AI-driven platforms offers new avenues for enhancing transparency, real-time risk assessment, and compliance with Sharia principles. Case studies from regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East demonstrate the successful application of these methods, particularly in currency hedging and managing interest rate risks. The review concludes that while Islamic finance faces limitations in utilizing conventional financial derivatives, it possesses a unique potential to develop robust, ethical risk management frameworks that not only align with global financial stability goals but also promote sustainable and socially responsible investments. Embracing innovative techniques and digital solutions will be crucial in expanding the capabilities of Islamic financial institutions to compete in a volatile global market.",2024-01-01,
CRYPTOCURRENCY AS A PHENOMENON OF A NEW FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE: ECONOMIC ESSENCE AND MAIN FEATURES,"The article systematizes the existing definitions of the concept of “cryptocurrency”, concludes about the complexity and multidimensional nature of this concept, as well as the lack of a unified approach to its interpretation. The understanding of the definition of cryptocurrency as a new digital type of money protected by a cryptographic code with the impossibility of its forgery or copying, which can be used to measure the value of goods, services and other monetary units, used for commodity circulation, savings and investment, is summarized. It is determined that the main characteristic features of all cryptocurrencies are: decentralization, anonymity, limited supply and scarcity, speed, globality, irreversibility and security of transactions. The set of elements that ensure the release and turnover of cryptocurrencies, as well as their use, forms the object of management-the cryptocurrency market itself. It is a system that combines into a single whole all the elements that ensure the release (issue) of cryptocurrencies and their circulation according to the laws of supply and demand between participants in this market. Based on the results of a retrospective analysis of the emergence and development of cryptographic money, it is concluded that their historical beginning can be considered 1983, when American researcher David Chaum developed a system that made it possible to combine anonymity of payments with transparency for all market participants called “eCash”. The first full-fledged cryptocurrency was bitcoin, created in 2008. The article reflects the current challenges and prospects of the cryptocurrency market. The possibility of high returns attracts investors, but the lack of transparent regulation creates risks. Adapting legislation to international standards is one of the key ways to minimize these risks. This will not only help expand the crypto asset market, but also strengthen user protection and promote trust in this instrument as a financial asset. It can also be noted that, in addition to regulatory measures, an important aspect is the educational component on accounting and taxation of transactions with cryptocurrency. Informing users about the possible risks and principles of the cryptocurrency market will help investors make more informed decisions and avoid financial losses due to a lack of understanding of the specifics of this asset.",2024-01-01,
Court of Arbitration of the Warsaw Money Exchange (1921–1939),"In recent years, suggestions have been made to create a specialized court for the capital market, which would have jurisdiction over disputes that have arisen between participants in the market, as well as to introduce new special judicial procedures to, among other things, protect investors and streamline the settlement of stock market disputes. These suggestions are primarily due to the recognition of the peculiarities that characterize trade in the capital market (with particular emphasis on the stock market). Economic transactions in the broadest sense of this term are a dynamic phenomenon and, because contractual relationships constantly change and repeatedly form the basis for further transactions, disputes arising under commercial law require the quickest possible resolution.Therefore, it can be said that trade at stock exchanges is the quintessence of these dynamics and complexities of the legal relationships such trade involves, and this requires even greater efficiency and diligence in protecting the interests of its participants, including the ensuring of the right of recourse to a court. In addition, the settlement of disputes arising in the capital market requires not only knowledge of procedural law, but, most importantly, expertise in the trade in financial instruments. These issues and the resulting needs were recognized long ago, soon after Poland regained its independence in 1918, when the first exchanges were established on Polish soil to operate under national legislation. The commodity and stock exchange law enacted at the time provided for the need to ensure adequate protection of the interests of exchange members by, among other things, allowing them to assert their rights in courts.Although the status of the arbitration courts established pursuant to the provisions of the law was unclear, as they were a sort of intermediate solution between a court exercising coercive powers and an arbitral court, they certainly contributed to the implementation of exchange trade participants’ right to recourse to a court and to ensure high ethical standards in the conclusion of transactions. One such court operated between 1921 and 1939 at the most important Polish exchange of the interwar period in terms of trading volume – the Warsaw Money Exchange. The purpose of this article is to introduce this institution, also by discussing how the court was appointed against the background of the organization of the exchange and by presenting the scope of competence and the proceedings before the court. The authors also focused on presenting and analyzing data on the activities of the said institution.",2024-01-01,
IMPLEMENTASI TERHADAP TIPOLOGI PENCUCIAN UANG TERKAIT TINDAK PIDANA BIDANG PERBANKAN (STUDI KASUS PUTUSAN PENGADILAN TINGGI DKI JAKARTA NOMOR 222/Pid.Sus/2020/PT DKI),"Abstrak: Kemajuan teknologi informasi dan globalisasi keuangan mengakibatkan makin mendunianya perdagangan barang dan jasa arus finansial yang mengikutinya. Perkembangannya Tindak Pidana Pencucian Uang semakin hari menjadi semakin kompleks, dimana perkembangannya telah dilakukan dengan melintasi batas-batas yurisdiksi dan menggunakan modus yang semakin bervariatif, memanfaatkan lembaga di luar sistem keuangan. Peningkatan jumlah transaksi dari waktu ke waktu pada bidang ekonomi merupakan faktor pendorong yang sangat besar terhadap timbulnya beberapa bentuk kejahatan baru seperti pada kejahatan di bidang perbankan. Pendekatan masalah dalam penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan yuridis normatif dan yuridis empiris. Sumber data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini antara lain data Primer, yaitu data yang diperoleh langsung dari hasil penelitian di lapangan melalui Putusan Perkara Tindak Pidana Pencucian Uang yang sudah inkracht van gewisjde terkait Putusan Pengadilan Tinggi Nomor : 222/Pid.Sus/2020/PT DKI dan data pendukung sekunder serta tersier.Terdakwa GW latar belakang pekerjaan sebagai karyawan swasta yang melakukan penghimpunan dana dari masyarakat melalui investasi pada perusahaan tanpa izin usaha dari Bank Indonesia/Badan Pengawas Perdagangan Berjangka Komoditi. Tahapan tindak pidana pencucian uang yang dilakukan terdakwa melalui placement&amp;layering. Implementasi terhadap tipologi pencucian uang terkait tindak pidana perbankan yang dilakukan PPATK dalam analisa yang dilakukan melalui riset tipologi sudah baik. Berkembangnya teknologi dan informasi, terdapat tren baru dari variabel pembentuk tipologi seperti penggunaan jasa keuangan Fintech dan Market Place. Dilihat dari Putusan Pengadilan Tinggi DKI Jakarta terkait dengan tren baru penggunaan jasa keuangan Fintech dan Market Place belum terlihat dari modus yang digunakan oleh terdakwa, penggunaan teknologi baru terlihat sebatas pada underline Tindak Pidana Perbankan menggunakan investasi berupa trading forex.Kata kunci: Tindak Pidana Pencucian Uang, Tindak Pidana Perbankan, Tipologi Abstract: The advancement of information technology and financial globalization has led to the increasing globalization of the trade of goods and financial flows of services. The development of money laundering crimes is becoming more complex over time, where it has evolved by crossing jurisdictional boundaries and employing increasingly diverse methods, utilizing institutions outside the financial system. The increase in the number of transactions over time in the economic field is a significant driving factor for the emergence of various new forms of crimes, such as in the banking sector. The approach to this research problem uses a normative and empirical juridical approach. The data sources used in this research include primary data, which is obtained directly from research conducted in the field through the Decision of Money Laundering Case with the inkracht van gewisjde related to the Decision of the High Court Number: 222/Pid.Sus/2020/PT DKI and secondary and tertiary supporting data.The defendant, GW, with a background as a private sector employee, engaged in fundraising from the public through investments in companies without the necessary business permits from Bank Indonesia/Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency. The stages of money laundering committed by the defendant involved placement and layering. The implementation of anti-money laundering typologies related to banking crimes conducted by PPATK (Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center) in the analysis conducted through typology research is good. With the advancement of technology and information, there are new trends in the variables that form these typologies, such as the use of Fintech and Market Place financial services. Based on the decision of the High Court of Jakarta related to the new trend of using Fintech and Market Place financial services, it does not seem to be reflected in the methods used by the defendant; the use of new technology appears to be limited to underlying banking crimes involving forex trading.Keywords: Money Laundering Offense, Banking Offense, Typology",2024-01-01,
Mutual Fund Investment Strategies for Retail Investors: An Empirical Study in the Light of Market Movements,"Mutual fund investment strategies provide retail investors with diversified and professionally managed portfolios, making them an attractive option for wealth accumulation. One popular approach is index investing, where funds track a market index, aiming to replicate its returns. This strategy offers low costs and broad exposure. On the other hand, active management involves fund managers making investment decisions to outperform the market. While potentially yielding higher returns, it comes with higher fees. Asset allocation is another key strategy, where investors diversify their holdings across various asset classes like stocks, bonds, and commodities. This helps manage risk and optimize returns based on individual risk tolerance and financial goals. For those seeking stability, income funds focus on generating regular dividends, suited for conservative investors. In contrast, growth funds target capital appreciation by investing in companies with high growth potential. Careful consideration of these strategies, aligned with one's financial objectives and risk appetite, is essential for retail investors to make informed mutual fund choices.",2024-01-01,
Optimization of portfolios with cryptocurrencies: Markowitz and GARCH-Copula model approach,"The growing interest in cryptocurrencies has drawn the attention of the financial world to this innovative medium of exchange. This study aims to explore the impact of cryptocurrencies on portfolio performance. We conduct our analysis retrospectively, assessing the performance achieved within a specific time frame by three distinct portfolios: one consisting solely of equities, bonds, and commodities; another composed exclusively of cryptocurrencies; and a third, which combines both 'traditional' assets and the best-performing cryptocurrency from the second portfolio.To achieve this, we employ the classic variance-covariance approach, utilizing the GARCH-Copula and GARCH-Vine Copula methods to calculate the risk structure. The optimal asset weights within the optimized portfolios are determined through the Markowitz optimization problem. Our analysis predominantly reveals that the portfolio comprising both cryptocurrency and traditional assets exhibits a higher Sharpe ratio from a retrospective viewpoint and demonstrates more stable performances from a prospective perspective. We also provide an explanation for our choice of portfolio optimization based on the Markowitz approach rather than CVaR and ES.",2024-01-01,
Frequency Volatility Connectedness and Portfolio Hedging of U.S. Energy Commodities,"We analyze (frequency) connectedness and portfolio hedging among U.S. energy commodities from 1997 to 2023. We show that the total connectedness increased over time, likely due to the increasing financialization of energy commodities. It fluctuates with respect to (i) different investment horizons and (ii) different periods of distress. The early stage of the Russia-Ukraine war is associated with the highest systemic risk, followed by the Covid-19 pandemic and global financial crisis (GFC). In the frequency domain, the results imply that investors perceive the greatest risk at longer investment horizons, particularly during the three major distress periods. We also show that despite it is difficult and more costly to diversify an energy portfolio during distress periods, adding natural gas seems to bring non-marginal diversification benefits.",2024-01-01,
Rallying Ruble and the Weaponization of Finance,"Against initial expectations, comprehensive sanctions did not plunge Russia into a currency crisis. Unlike other emerging market currencies during times of stress, the Russian ruble experienced a short-lived depreciation. After plummeting in the early days of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the ruble has staged a remarkable comeback and has more than doubled against the US dollar from its March slump, becoming the best-performing emerging market currency so far this year.Several factors explain why Russia averted a currency crisis despite the freeze of most of its central bank reserves. The current account surplus soared to a record USD58bn in the first quarter of 2022 and could climb as high as USD250bn (in the absence of a comprehensive embargo on energy exports and a sanctions-induced compression of imports). The Russian authorities also took timely countermeasures to orchestrate an “FX intervention by delegation,” including stringent capital controls, a temporary gold-fixing of the ruble and asking energy importers to switch payments to rubles-together with a steep policy rate rise to stabilize the ruble after it plummeted.However, the ruble’s rapid ascent might have reached a turning point and could eventually backfire. Since the ruble trades in a very thin market (and mostly domestically, given the dramatic drop in demand outside Russia due to sanctions), its recent appreciation belies a struggling domestic economy, which is expected to slump into a severe recession this year-but it has real consequences. Since most energy exports remain FX-denominated, a stronger ruble hurts the government’s budget balance by lowering the local currency value, which could be further impacted by the potential for EU tariffs on Russian energy exports during the phase-out of oil imports. Last week, the central bank responded with the third rate cut since April to tame the currency’s appreciation. Going forward, the current upward pressure on the ruble is likely to subside over time as some of the Russian countermeasures expire, Russian energy exports become less competitive and the deteriorating economic outlook begins to weigh on the FX rate.Beyond the effects on Russia’s currency, the “weaponization of finance” aimed a paralyzing Russia’s economy could also have long-lasting consequences on the global financial system. While some of the sanctions, such as the freezing of almost two-thirds of Russia’s FX reserves, were politically expeditious, they also raise questions about financial sovereignty in a strongly USD-dominated monetary system. We could reasonably see some countries start diversifying away from the US dollar and/or the Western-dominated global financial architecture over time, especially those that feel they could be targeted by sanctions at some point. Furthermore, Russia’s short-lived gold-fixing might serve as blueprint for a more serious attempt by countries that have sufficient gold reserves (or commodities exports) to depart from the current system of fiat currencies.",2024-01-01,
Emerging Market Sovereigns: Turbulent Times Ahead?,"Financial tightening in advanced economies and slowing trade growth have created less favorable conditions for emerging market sovereigns, which have been amplified by the effects of the war in Ukraine on commodity prices. While the capital accounts of emerging market sovereigns are often crucially influenced by the US monetary stance, their current accounts are very much dependent on demand from China due to their upstream integration in global supply chains.A repeat of sovereign debt crises similar to the ones in the 1980s and 1990s appears unlikely. However, several (large) emerging market (EM) economies have become highly vulnerable to tighter financing conditions, including those in Emerging Europe (Hungary, Romania and Turkey) and Africa (Egypt, Kenya and Tunisia), as well as in Latin America (Argentina and Chile), albeit to a lesser extent.Under baseline conditions, we expect a broad-based but contained EM sovereign spread widening. In local currency terms, divergences between countries are as heterogeneous as inflationary pressures. Local currency yields will remain elevated in 2022, with a gradual reversal in 2023 as headwinds start to abate. Should our adverse scenario materialize, we expect the escalation of the war in Ukraine to cause a global recession with significantly higher inflation. Deteriorating EM fundamentals and generalized capital outflows would lead to a significant widening of hard currency spreads and higher local currency yields.",2024-01-01,
"Examining the Co-Movements, Hedging Transmission and Time-Varying Causality between Commodities and Stock Markets During the Covid-19 Period: Evidence from the G7 and China","This study delves into the risk interactions between financial markets, Gold, and Oil during the COVID-19 crisis (December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2021). Analyzing daily closing indices and Gold, Brent, and WTI futures, it employed the Markov Switching model to scrutinize price co-movements and dynamic correlations between domestic equity and commodity markets. The time-varying LA-VAR Granger causality test explored hedging transmission. S&P500 had negligible impact on WTI, yet WTI significantly influenced S&P500 in specific periods. Asymmetric effects were observed between FTSE index and Brent, with pronounced unidirectional causality from WTI to TSX, notably during the crisis. DAX index showed bidirectional causality with Gold, influenced asymmetrically by Brent. MIB index depicted asymmetrical bidirectional links with Gold, while NIKKEI and CSI300 showed inconsistent or sporadic relationships with Gold and Brent.",2024-01-01,
A CRISE HIPOTECÁRIA AMERICANA DO SUBPRIME E SEUS IMPACTOS NO COMÉRCIO EXTERIOR BRASILEIRO (2008-2009),"Our objective with this essay is to understand how one of the biggest financial crisis in the latest years, the 2008 crisis, established negative consequences to the Brazilian foreign trade, mainly to our exportations.We used the Globalization concept to base our analysis, once the financial crisis spreads itself through the world due to the interdependence of world economies.We mostly called up on Ernani Teixeira, Central Bank economist, to understand the beginning of this crisis on the US housing market.With the raised assumption in this issue, we can realize that due to the lower external demand for commodities, our foreign trade numbers, specially our exportations, has been strongly pulled down at the time the crisis bubble blowed up and the following months ( 2009), according to the statistics of institutions as IEDI, IPARDES, IPEA and MDIC.",2024-01-01,
"Dynamic Connectedness among Commodity Markets, Sentiments and Global Shocks","This paper examines the effectiveness of the dynamic connectedness between the commodity market groups (real assets price indices), sentiments and global shock indicators. Applying the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) based dynamic connectedness approach, we find three intriguing results: firstly, the media sentiments about commodities and the global shock indicators such as economic policy uncertainty, inflation, supply chain pressure, financial conditions and geopolitical risk tend to spill over shocks to the all metal and energy market groups. Secondly, from the network approach, we found two main mechanisms through which the global shock indicators spill over shocks to the commodity markets – either directly or indirectly through the commodity sentiments. Considering the time-varying impact, our third finding shows that the effectiveness of the connectedness becomes marginal especially after 2015 thus during the phases of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war coupled with the energy crisis, etc. During these global crises the commodity markets particularly the energy market group spill over shocks to global inflation via the influence of the commodity sentiments. Our results play a significant role in portfolio risk management and investment decisions and policy formulation.",2024-01-01,
DEVELOPMENT OF MARKETING STRATEGIES FOR INTRODUCING A NEW PRODUCT TO THE MARKET,"The article reveals the features of introducing a new product to the market and examines the set of marketing strategies as they are applied on the market. The stages of product novelty are considered: the appearance of such a product that has no analogues; change of external design with direct observance of existing consumer properties; a change in consumer characteristics, which makes changes in the specific way of satisfying needs; improvement of basic technical characteristics without specific changes in production technologies. Methods of studying a new product include conducting special experiments and surveying consumers and specialists involved in the development and production of the product. The development of a new product is a complex process that includes the following stages: ideation, concept development, prototype development and testing, marketing research, production and implementation, monitoring and improvement. The reasons for the failure of new products on the market have been studied. Ways to reduce the risk of factors affecting the success of the release of new products are proposed. Marketing strategy is a mandatory component of the overall business strategy. It is proven that the choice of a specific strategy depends on the type of business the firm is engaged in. The formation of a strategy for the development of new products is carried out after analyzing the consumer market, the company's capabilities, analyzing competitors and the external environment, understanding the possibilities of the company's budget and other important issues. For such purposes, the strategy of diversification is most often used. If a company has a strong image in its industry, diversification can help attract new partners and expand its sphere of influence. For the successful implementation of the diversification strategy, the availability of sufficient financial resources is key. The strategy for the development of a new product on the market is the strategy of variation, with the help of which the firm can offer a new version of the product on the market, while the old one is subject to elimination (withdrawal from circulation). The use of a commodity strategy of diversification and variation depends on the specific conditions of the company's activity and is determined by the volume and level of economic efficiency of sales.",2024-01-01,
Us Monetary Policy Spillovers to Developing Countries: The Commodity-Financial Channel,"We reconsider the transmission of world interest rate shocks towards low and middle income countries that are dependent on commodities' export. Through the decisions of international storers, the world price of storable commodities is inversely related to world interest rates. This relationship represents a new channel through which commodity-exporting countries are affected by the global financial cycle, which we label as the commodity-financial channel. We first document that countries with a higher commodity-dependence suffer larger spillovers from US monetary policy shocks. We then build a model able to rationalize the mechanism behind this empirical evidence. We show that the new transmission mechanism amplifies the reaction of the economy while changing qualitatively the sectoral responses. This suggests that commodity-dependent countries are more vulnerable to international monetary disturbances and that, through the new channel, even those economies that are disconnected from international financial markets can be affected by the global financial cycle.",2024-01-01,
Financial investment risk analysis and countermeasures research based on CVaR-GARCH model,"Abstract In this paper, based on the vector autoregressive algorithm, the conditional value-at-risk algorithm is used to compute the optimal portfolio, and the mean-CVaR model oriented to portfolio optimization is established based on the mean-variance model. To explain the volatility accumulation characteristics of financial asset return series, the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model with CvaR is designed. After the design and optimization of the algorithm are completed, the daily closing price of a commodity futures contract, CSI 300 and the stock situation of different companies, and the daily closing index data of the financial index of a city are collected, and the three major groups of data are tested for the model of this paper. The results show that the maximum value of the CVaR-GARCH model at 95% and 90% confidence levels is generally 4000~6000, which is higher than that of the VaR model alone at 1000~2000. The difference between the actual loss and the loss predicted by the model in this paper is 88.618~279.181. The number of failures at 90% confidence level is 44. The number of failures at 95% confidence level is 31, while the number of failures at 99% confidence level is 1,000~1,000. The number of failures at 99% confidence level is 1,000~1,000. Number of times is 31. At a 99% confidence level, the number of failures is 11. This results in a generalized failure rate of 6.03%. Investors can make program adjustments with more accuracy due to the model in this paper’s ability to predict stock market risk.",2024-01-01,
Financial Market Stability between China and the Us: A Commodity Financialization Based Analysis,"In recent years, the phenomenon of ""commodity financialization"" has garnered significant attention in academia. This paper utilizes financial market samples from the period 2010-2022 for both the United States and China to instigate the influence of commodity financialization on the stability of financial markets. We find that the short-term impact of U.S. commodity financialization on commodity prices is more pronounced; long-term fluctuations in commodity prices, rather than commodity financialization, dominate the stability of financial markets; in the short term, commodity financialization plays a dominant role in the destabilization of financial markets, surpassing the effects of commodity supply, demand, and prices.",2024-01-01,
Forecasting Commodity Prices using Machine Learning,"This research endeavor focuses on forecasting price movements across 14 diverse commodities by leveraging technical analysis and comprehensive dataset correlations. The dataset integrates pivotal economic indicators and historical commodity prices, covering a wide spectrum from natural gas to agricultural products. Key technical indicators, such as lagged values, moving averages, MACD, historical volatility, and standard deviation, are used to predict percentage changes in commodity prices over time. The methodology underscores meticulous preprocessing steps, crafting technical features to capture intricate patterns and interrelationships within the dataset. These features are derived from a blend of time series analysis, statistical exploration, and machine learning techniques. An extensive suite of machine learning models is employed, including SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, XGBoost, Random Forests, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, VAR, VARIMA, VARMA, GRU, LSTM, and Extra Trees. Thorough evaluation with diverse metrics provides a comprehensive understanding of their efficacy in price prediction. Further enhancements include Isolation Forest for outlier detection, feature standardization with Standards Caler, and hierarchical clustering techniques, optimizing dataset analysis and model performance. Ultimately, this research aims to develop a precise predictive model merging technical analysis with economic indicators for commodity price forecasting. The potential insights could significantly impact decision-making in commodity trading and financial markets, presenting valuable contributions to this evolving landscape.",2024-01-01,
Carsten Nielsen and his “controversial” agreements in Romania (1915). Files re-opened in Nazi Germany,"Neutrality-era Romania sometimes behaves like a transit country with the appearance of an oriental bazaar. The ideal place where all sorts of foreigners (some of dubious reputation) come to do noisy business. Eager traders who are eager to make a profit and are eager to get their hands on the most precious commodities in wartime: food and fuel. They were selling, sadly, almost everything. Corruption had touched the moral fibre of a nation in search of its identity. The insiders were well aware of the situation when they wrote: “With the refined senses that usually distinguish thieves, these individuals have noticed that we now have to work with money here and therefore they think that their time has come to fish in troubled waters”. These words belong to Austro-Hungarian plenipotentiary Ottokar Czernin. He recorded them in a report of February 1915 to the Foreign Minister. They show the involvement of Central Power diplomats in secret negotiations on trade arrangements that also concealed political desires in Romania at the time. In the economic sphere, these arrangements were aimed at obtaining the coveted export permits for grain and accepting the transit of munitions for the Ottoman Empire. There were, of course, possible political scenarios arising from the conclusion of the contracts. All were aimed at Romania’s entry into the war against Russia. The War Ministry held such discussions and even concluded a controversial trade treaty. Citing the need to ensure supplies of armaments and the import of ammunition on the old German (or Austro-Hungarian, as the case may be route, which had become inaccessible to Romania when neutrality in the war was proclaimed, the Romanian army chiefs sat down at the negotiating table. This is practically how the “grain for arms” exchange system was set up, a model of lucrative business justified by the superior interests of the state. The corrupt middlemen and officials in particular stood to gain. Many foreign traders were registered with the General Security, and at the time they were also known as grain traders. One of them, Carsten Nielsen, managed to rise to the top. He brokered the signing of a trade contract with the War Ministry which, once in force, would probably have secured Germany a benevolent neutrality from Romania. But this contract was never implemented. Carsten Nielsen suffered considerable damage. Always seeking justice in the interwar years, he created a legal dispute over financial compensation for losses resulting from the blocking of Romanian business. This legal dispute did not die out until the years of Nazi Germany. Nielsen drafted numerous petitions, some of which were even addressed to the German Foreign Ministry. The Communication analyses the contents of these documents and identifies information that sheds new light on the ‘alternatives’ to Romanian neutrality.",2024-01-01,
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT: GLOBAL AND LOCAL FLOWS (THE CASE OF THE REPUBLIC OF NORTH MACEDONIA),"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is the notion that can be summarized in the form in which it represents the process in which an enterprise from one country invests capital in an existing enterprise or in a new enterprise established in another country. The standard definition of foreign direct investment is given by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to which FDI is defined as the establishment of a lasting interest in and significant degree of influence over the operations of an enterprise in one economy by an investor in another economy. FDI has proven to have an expressed importance mainly in allowing the transfer of technology – especially in the form of new types of capital inputs – that cannot be achieved or at least in the form and volume required through financial investment or trade in goods and services. FDI has already proven that it can boost competition in the domestic input market, but also motivates the employment of domestic labor. In recent decades, the global map of inflow and outflow FDI has changed considerably. Traditionally, FDI originated from developed economies, which have recently gained significant ground in the share of FDI flows between geopolitically aligned economies. In particular during financial crises there is substantial evidence that FDI can lead many developing countries to consider it as an inflow of selected private capital and in certain cases even as a single capital inflow. Such a thing finds support in the tendency of economists who insist on the free flow of capital across national borders because it enables capital to have more favorable preconditions for return at the highest rate. However, the tradition has recently been changing, making the largest sector for FDI projects to be closely related to software and IT services. Investors see rising commodity prices, increased geopolitical unrest and political instability, as well as high inflation in an emerging market as the most likely risks at this time. The official data provided by World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), OECD, as well as the local National Bank and State Statistical Office are unanimous that in the last 20 years, North Macedonia has maintained a continuous increase in FDI, but unfortunately, at a comparative level with the countries of the region, it continues to lags behind. The North Macedonian authorities are progressing towards the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) objectives, including preserving public finances, reducing energy subsidies, tackling high inflation and ensuring financial stability, which will also increase the possibility real for FDI inflows.",2024-01-01,
Hedging with Financial Derivatives and Firm Performance of Consumer Goods Companies Listed on Nigeria Exchange Group,"Hedging with derivatives is a common strategy to manage foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk and mitigating potential losses or gains that might arise from fluctuations in the market. This study was conducted to reveal findings on the impact of hedging activities using derivatives on the financial performance of consumer goods companies listed on Nigerian Exchange (NGX). The independent variables for the study are foreign currency hedge, interest rate hedge and commodity price hedge. Data were collected from Ten (20) consumer goods companies quoted on Nigerian Exchange covering 2018 to 2022 financial years. The results of hypothesis testing reveal that hedging with derivatives has a significant effect on firm performance. This findings supports the findings of Alan and Gupta (2018) and Lenee and Oki (2017), who conclude that the use of hedging can minimize the volatility and has a positive effect on firm value. As a general recommendations, it is important to note that regulating the derivatives market is essential to ensure stability, transparency, prevent excessive speculation, manipulation, and enhance fair practices in the financial system.",2024-01-01,
Freedom to Flourish,"One cause of gentrification and displacement of multigenerational communities of color has been the increase of private equity firms buying affordable homes, upgrading them, raising rents, and evicting tenants. This essay focuses on housing financialization and the increasing shift from the use value of housing as a place to live to the exchange value of housing as a commodity and investment for corporate profit. After identifying the problem of gentrification and housing speculation in Oakland, California, the essay draws on ecowomanist/mujerista/feminist sources to offer a theological foundation in support of housing as a social good for the freedom of households and communities to flourish. It also argues that religious organizations have a moral commitment and role to play in offering an alternative vision of community and in organizing for housing and racial justice.",2024-01-01,
Analisis Legalitas Transaksional Binary Option di Indonesia,"Abstract The development of financial technology has given birth to a new financial transaction, namely Binary Options.

"Prevalence of Induced Abortion among Female Students in Selected Tertiary Learning Institutions in Gaborone City, Botswana","Induced abortion signifies that pregnancy has been tempered with. Abortion is the removal of an embryo or fetus weighing less than 500 grams from its mother. It can either be spontaneous (unprompted) or induced. Abortion remains one of the leading causes of maternal deaths in developing countries with induced abortion being the key cause. In 2014 from January to August, 9 abortion related deaths occurred in Botswana. There are several reasons female students in tertiary institutions resort to seeking induced abortion which include the socio-demographics like age and socio-economic factors like financial instability. Parental fears, unintended pregnancy and pressure from the partner also force females to terminate pregnancy. Induced abortion has claimed many women's lives especially in developing countries with very restrictive abortion laws like Botswana as women do not access safe abortion care services. The study intends to establish the determinants of induced abortion among female students in selected tertiary learning institutions in Gaborone City, Botswana. It concentrated primarily on determining the prevalence of induced abortion. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using both quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques. Systematic random sampling technique was used to come up with 278 participants. Prior to commencement of data collection, all ethical and logistical prerequisites were satisfied. Informed consent was solicited from all the study participants and the purpose of the study was fully explained. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Microsoft Excel spread sheet was used to code, clean, and enter the data, which was then exported for analysis to the statistical package for social sciences version 24. Frequency distribution tables, percentages graphs, and pie charts were used to illustrate the descriptive information. The study revealed that prevalence of induced abortion among female students in Gaborone City is 7.9%. They even suggested that induced abortion be liberalized. Age was the only socio-demographic factor associated with induced abortion with p = 0.047 using Chi Square test χ2 = 7.609, df = 3. The study findings concluded that female students resort to induced abortion as a result of pressure from both parents and male partners especially when the pregnancy is unintended. The study recommends that the abortion law in Botswana be made liberal to ease access to safe abortion care services. It also recommends that contraceptive commodities should consistently be available in public health facilities.",2024-01-01,
Analysis of Currency Risk Hedging Strategies in Multinational Companies: A Case Study of the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War and Surge in US Dollar Exchange Rate,"The volatility of exchange rates due to frequent global events is one of today’s hot topics. The profitability of large multinational corporations is highly correlated with exchange rates. This paper primarily takes a case study approach, focusing on the combination of global events and large multinational corporations, integrated with the strategic optimization of commodity swaps. The ultimate goal is to develop innovative strategies for large multinational corporations to hedge against foreign exchange risk. The first case of the article focuses on the analysis of the Russian Ruble exchange rate, which first fell and then rose from February to August 2022, and Coca-Cola HBC modifies cash and debt to account for foreign exchange swings. The second case assesses the financial impact of a spike in the U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2022, where Coca-Cola reduces its assets in financial derivatives designated as hedges and significantly increases its liabilities to offset them. In addition, the study also presents a novel strategy that mixes forward foreign currency contracts with commodity futures. Reduce risk by securing profits ahead of time. This comprehensive analysis aims to provide companies with insightful and actionable strategies for managing the complexity and uncertainty of currency market volatility.",2024-01-01,
The Financial Uncertainty of Climate-Related Assets,"We explore financial uncertainty across climate-sensitive assets, focusing on common factors of uncertainty. We start by constructing a new econometric measure of aggregate uncertainty for these assets, using a multivariate stochastic volatility model. We then exploit the factor stochastic volatility specification of the model to decompose total uncertainty and extract uncertainty factors, defined as components of uncertainty that reflect common shocks across different asset classes. We study the empirical relationship of these factors with the option-implied volatility of stocks, distinguishing between green and brown firms. We find that one uncertainty factor, which is positively correlated with climate news indices and loads heavily on commodity markets, is strongly associated with the excess volatility of brown stocks relative to green ones, especially for longer option maturities. We show that such relationship with (risk-neutral) option-implied volatility is not driven by time-varying risk aversion nor simply due to commodity market shocks.",2024-01-01,
COOPERATION INTERACTIONS IN THE AGRI-FOOD COMPLEX: BARRIERS AND DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS,"In the context of this study, cooperation is considered as a form of joint activity of subjects (usually individuals) with the aim of realizing common interests. The main factors limiting the possibilities for the development of agricultural cooperation include: low level of social and economic trust of the rural population in each other, loss of trust in the cooperative ideology and the priority of private interests, lack of positive examples of the development of cooperation, high level of regression and disunity of rural communities, sporadic and fragmentation of the agricultural cooperation system, low level of financial capabilities of potential cooperators, limited sources of financing investment and operating activities, limited government support funds, low level of investment attractiveness of cooperative associations, shortage of qualified personnel, the need to ensure certain standards of product quality and its compliance with established requirements, etc. It is concluded that the potential for the development of cooperation in the agricultural sector is determined by the significant number of small businesses - potential cooperators, the ability of cooperation to increase the stability of social ties in rural communities and the effectiveness of economic interactions of rural economic entities, the ability of small commodity producers to function successfully in those market niches which are not attractive to large businesses, the possibility of cooperation to create conditions for increasing the level of income of participants in cooperative associations, the possibility of cooperation to saturate local markets in rural areas with high-quality food products and essential goods, the transition to a cluster model of development of agro-industrial integration, which involves easier entry into the cluster system of cooperative small commodity producers, etc.",2024-01-01,
The Construction and Concept Validation of Indian Financial Market Composite Risk Index (IFM: CRI): A Vibrant Risk Indicator to Retail Investors,"The financial market volatility has been a major interest to all the stakeholders of the market especially to the retail investors post 2020. In this backdrop, the study is focused on constructing a Composite Risk Index (CRI) for the Indian Financial Market and examining the various methods of weighting as well as types of volatility capture in the construction of the Financial Market Composite Risk Index. The study intends on giving its contribution on the methodological portion of the derivation of appropriate weights to each segment of financial market. The study is based on the daily price series from 1st January 2020 to 31st March 2023. The research develops nine (09) different Composite Risk Index based on the types of volatility capture [Standard Deviation (SD), Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH), Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH)] and method of deriving the weights [Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)] of various sub markets [ Equity, Commodity and Forex] and its segments [Spot and Derivatives]. The inter and intra evaluation of nine CRI are carried out with the help of nonparametric statistical tool Kruskal Wallis Test, further the pairwise comparation is also preformed to analyze the homogeneity between the types of volatility capture and method of deriving the weights. The results reveal that, GARCH based DEA Composite Risk Index is better exhibiting the volatility of the Indian Financial Markets compared to their counterpart CRI and also having a high co-movement with India VIX.",2024-01-01,
Is There an Information Channel of Monetary Policy?,"Exploiting the heteroscedasticity of the changes in short-term and long-term interest rates and exchange rates around the FOMC announcement, we identify three structural monetary policy shocks. We eliminate the predictable part of the shocks and study their effects on financial variables and macro variables. The first shock resembles a conventional monetary policy shock, and the second resembles an unconventional monetary shock. The third shock leads to an increase in interest rates, stock prices, industrial production, consumer prices, and commodity prices. At the same time, the excess bond premium and uncertainty decrease, and the U.S. dollar depreciates. Therefore, this third shock combines all the characteristics of a central bank information shock.",2024-01-01,

Measuring Illicit Financial Flows: New Data and Methods,"A major source of illicit financial flows (IFFs) out of developing countries accrues from the under-invoicing of commodity exports. This erodes the tax base of resource-rich developing countries, and hence their capacity to mobilise domestic resources for development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, specifically call on states to reduce IFFs and enhance domestic resource mobilisation. Yet a weak capacity to assess the magnitude and drivers of the phenomenon has limited the ability of developing countries to effectively curb IFFs. This has been compounded by a lack of consensus over IFF definitions together with poor data and weak methods. Drawing on six years of interdisciplinary research into commodity trade–related IFFs, this chapter examines novel data sources and recent methodological advances that researchers and regulators can draw upon to better capture and eventually reduce IFFs. It situates such advances within the fast-expanding literature on domestic resource mobilisation, taxation and IFFs, focusing on three major channels; namely, trade mispricing, abusive transfer pricing and tax evasion through wealth offshoring. The chapter concludes by discussing the scope for improved data collection and evidence generation. This, together with global taxation reform, can greatly contribute to effectively enhancing domestic resource mobilisation in developing countries.",2024-01-01,
Curbing Illicit Financial Flows in Commodity Trade and Beyond,"Establishing a more transparent, effective and equitable and framework for trade and taxation is crucial to enabling commodity exporting states to mobilise domestic resources for sustainable development. The current drive to reform the global governance of taxation offers opportunities, but takes place in the context of heightened North–South tensions, reduced trust in multilateralism and calls for deeper decolonisation. Drawing on a six-year multidisciplinary research project involving academic institutions from commodity exporting and trading countries, this chapter presents a research framework that the authors used for the study of illicit financial flows associated with commodity trade. It discusses major findings, and recommendations as to how to counter the ensuing tax base erosion in resource-rich developing countries. The latter can consider a range of policies and innovative measures to rein in commodity trade mispricing. But this is not enough. States hosting major trading and financial centres have to simultaneously address a range of pull factors. At the global level, fair taxation reform is key and must preserve a sovereign policy space, in which commodity exporting states may adopt context-specific solutions aligned with their institutional capacities. Finally, this chapter introduces the thematic volume of International Development Policy on illicit financial flows in the commodity sector and beyond.",2024-01-01,
THE FINANCIAL FRONT OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S WAR ON TERRORISM,"Two years after President Bush's first battle with terrorist finances, the White House released the Progress Report on the Global War on Terrorism. The report touts the Bush Administration's many victories, such as the defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the capture of key al-Qaeda leaders, and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. On the financial front, victories included the terrorists' $200 million frozen assets worldwide, the blocking orders on 300 terrorist organizations and supporters, and the FBI's crackdown on Islamic charities that funnel money to terrorist organizations. Given these victories, has the financial front of the War on Terrorism been successful? This researcher will argue that after initial victories, the U.S. government's efforts have stalemated. While the United States' front line is bogged down in politics, the terrorist organizations have flanked its line by shifting their assets into non-traditional banking systems, precious commodities, and into unregulated banking systems. The U.S. government will have to change tactics to counter this flank, or it will find itself in a protracted financial war with an enemy always one step ahead of it.",2024-01-01,
